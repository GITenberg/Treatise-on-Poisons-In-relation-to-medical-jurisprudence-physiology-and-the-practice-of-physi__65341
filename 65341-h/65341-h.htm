<p class='c005'>The author regrets that circumstances beyond his control
have delayed the re-appearance of the present work
beyond the period at which it was called for by the favourable
reception of the last edition. He has endeavoured to
take advantage of the numerous investigations which have
been carried on during the interval into the several departments
of Toxicology in the leading countries of Europe;
and has in consequence been led to enlarge the work materially.</p>

<p class='c006'>He trusts it may be allowed him to express his satisfaction
at finding, that the rapid progress made by Toxicological
science during the last eight years, while it has been productive
of many important additions to our knowledge, has
nevertheless not rendered any important alterations necessary
either in the general principles formerly laid down in
this work, or in what had been there stated as well ascertained
general facts.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <span class='small'>ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF POISONS.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>I shall discuss this subject by considering first the mode in which
poisons act, and secondly, the causes by which their action is liable
to be modified.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><span class='sc'>Section I.</span>—<i>On the Mode of Action of Poisons.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>On attending to the effects which follow the application of a poison
to the body, we perceive that they are sometimes confined to
the part where it is applied, and at other times extend to distant
organs. Hence the action of poisons may be naturally considered as
<i>local</i> and <i>remote</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The local effects of poisons are of three kinds. Some decompose
chemically or corrode the part to which they are applied. Others,
without immediately injuring its organization, inflame or irritate it.
Others neither corrode nor irritate, but make a peculiar impression on
the sentient extremities of the nerves, unaccompanied by any visible
change of structure.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have examples of local <i>corrosion</i> or chemical decomposition
in the effects of the concentrated mineral acids or alkalis on the skin,
and in the effects of strong oxalic acid, lunar caustic, or corrosive
sublimate on the stomach. In all of these instances the part to which
the poison is applied undergoes chemical changes, and the poison
itself sometimes undergoes chemical changes also. Thus oxalic acid
dissolves the gelatin of the animal textures; and in the instance of corrosive
sublimate, the elements of the poison unite with the albumen,
fibrin, and other principles of the tissues.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of local <i>irritation</i> and its various consequences we have many examples,
from redness, its slightest, to ulceration and gangrene, its
most severe effect. Thus externally, alcohol reddens the skin; cantharides
irritates the surface of the true skin and causes vesication;
tartar-emetic causes deep-seated inflammation of the true skin and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>pustular eruption; the juice of manchineel<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> spreading inflammation
of the subcutaneous cellular tissue; arsenic inflammation of all these
textures, and also death of the part and subsequent sloughing. Internally,
alcohol reddens the stomach, as it does the skin,—but more
permanently; while other substances, such as the diluted mineral
acids, arsenic, cantharides, euphorbium, and the like, may cause all
the phenomena of inflammation in the stomach and intestines, namely,
extravasation of blood, effusion of lymph, ulcers, gangrene. Many
of these irritants, such as arsenic, are in common speech called corrosives;
but they have not any power of causing chemical decomposition:
if they produce a breach in the texture of an organ, it is merely
through the medium of inflammation and its effects.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of <i>nervous impressions</i>, without any visible organic change, few
well authenticated and unequivocal instances are known. A good
example has been mentioned by Sir B. Brodie in the effect of monkshood
on the lips when chewed,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> an effect which I have also often
experienced: it causes a sense of numbness and tingling in the lips
and tongue, lasting for some hours, and quite unconnected with any
affection of the general nervous system. Another instance, first mentioned
to me by M. Robiquet, and which I have verified, occurs in
the effects of the strong hydrocyanic acid: when this acid is confined
in a glass tube with a finger on its open end, the point of the finger
becomes benumbed, exactly as from the local action of great cold.
These are undoubted instances of a purely nervous local impression
on the external surface of the body. The most unequivocal instance
I know of a similar impression on internal parts is a fact related by
Dr. W. Philip with regard to opium.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> When this poison was applied
to the inner coat of the intestines of a rabbit during life, the
muscular contractions of the gut were immediately paralyzed, without
the general system being for some time affected. The same effect
has been observed by Messrs. Morgan and Addison to follow the application
of ticunas to the intestine:<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> an instant and complete suspension
of the peristaltic movement took place as soon as it touched the
gut. A parallel fact has also been described by Dr. Monro, <i>secundus</i>:<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
when an infusion of opium was injected between the skin and
muscles of the leg of a frog, that leg soon became palsied, while the
animal was able to leap briskly on the other three. Analogous results
have farther been obtained with the prussic acid by M. Coullon.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
He remarked, that when one hind-leg of a frog was plunged in the
acid, it became palsied in thirty-five minutes, while the other hind-leg
continued perfectly sensible and irritable. Acetate of lead probably
possesses the same property.</p>

<p class='c006'>These facts are important, because some physiologists have doubted
whether any local impressions of a purely nervous nature, unconnected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>with appreciable organic change, may arise from the action
of poisons. Yet the existence of impressions of the kind is essential
to the stability of the doctrine of the sympathetic operation of
poisons,—that is, of the transmission of their influence from organ
to organ along the nerves. Nay, in the instance of many poisons
supposed to act in that manner, we must still farther believe in
the existence of primary nervous impressions, which are not only unconnected
with organic change, but likewise undistinguishable by any
local sign whatsoever.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of the three varieties in the local effects of poisons—corrosion,
irritation, and nervous impressions,—the first two may take place in
any tissue or organ; for example, they have been observed on the
skin, on the mucous membrane of the stomach, intestines, windpipe,
air tubes, bladder, and vagina, in the cellular tissue, in the serous
membranes of the chest and abdomen, in the muscular fibre. We
are not so well acquainted with the nature of local nervous impressions
on different tissues; but it is probable that in some textures of the body
they are very indistinct.</p>

<p class='c006'>So much for the local effects of poisons.</p>

<p class='c006'>On tracing the phenomena which follow more remotely, we observe
that the affected part sometimes recovers without any visible change,
sometimes undergoes the usual processes consequent on inflammation,
sometimes perishes at once and is thrown off; and if the organ is one
whose function is necessary to life, death may gradually ensue, in
consequence of that function being irrecoverably injured. The purest
example of the last train of phenomena is to be seen in the occasional
effects of the mineral acids or alkalis: death may take place simply
from starvation, because the inner surface of the stomach and intestines
is so much injured that a sufficient quantity of nutriment cannot be
assimilated.</p>

<p class='c006'>But death and its antecedents can seldom be accounted for in this
way. For symptoms are often witnessed, which bear no direct relation
to the local injury: death is generally too rapid to have arisen
from the function of the part having been annihilated: and the rapidity
of the poisoning is not proportional in different cases to the
local injury produced. Even the mineral acids and alkalis seldom
kill by impeding or annihilating digestion, because they often prove
fatal in a few hours; and among other poisons there are few which
ever cause death simply by disturbing the function of the part primarily
acted on. Death and the symptoms preceding it arise from an
injury of some other organ, to which they are not and cannot be directly
applied. We are thus led to consider their remote action.</p>

<p class='c006'>The term <i>remote</i> is here used in preference to the common phrase
<i>general</i> action, because the latter implies an action on the general
system or whole body; whereas it appears that an action of such a
kind is rare, and that most poisons which have an indirect action
exert it on one or more of the important organs only, and not on the
general system.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is not a better instance of the remote action of poisons than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>oxalic acid. It has been already mentioned that concentrated oxalic
acid is a corrosive: yet it never kills by destroying the function of
the stomach. Man, as well as the lower animals, will live several
days or weeks without nutriment. Now this poison has been known
to kill a man in ten minutes, and a dog in three minutes only. Neither
does it always induce, when swallowed, symptoms of an injury
of the stomach; for death is often preceded by tetanus, or apoplexy,
or mortal faintness. Nor is the violence of the poisoning proportional
to the extent of the local injury: in fact, death is most rapid
under circumstances in which the stomach is least injured, namely,
when the acid is considerably diluted.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Let us now proceed to enquire, then, in what way the influence
of a poison is conveyed from one organ to another.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here it will at once be perceived that the conveyance can be accomplished
in one of two ways only. Either the local impression
passes along the nerves to the organ secondarily affected; or the
poison enters the bibulous vessels, mingles with the blood, and
passes through the medium of the circulation. In the former way
poisons are said to act through <i>sympathy</i>, in the latter, through <i>absorption</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <i>On the Action of Poisons through Sympathy.</i> In the infancy of
toxicology all poisons were believed to act through sympathy. Since
Magendie’s discoveries on venous absorption in 1809, the favourite
doctrine has on the other hand been, that most, if not all, act through
the medium of the blood. And a recent theory, combining both
views, represents that, although many poisons do enter the blood,
the operation even of these nevertheless consists of an impression
made on the sentient extremities of the nerves of the blood-vessels
and conveyed thence along their filaments to the brain or other
organs.</p>

<p class='c006'>The nerves certainly possess the power of conveying from one
organ to another various impressions besides those of the external
senses. This is shown by many familiar phenomena; and in reference
to the present subject, is aptly illustrated by the remote or sympathetic
effects of mere mechanical injury and natural disease of the
stomach. Acute inflammation of the stomach generally proves fatal
long before death can arise from digestion being stopped; and it is
accompanied with constitutional symptoms, neither attributable to injury
of that function, nor developed in so marked a degree during inflammation
in other organs. These symptoms and the rapid death which
succeeds them are vaguely imputed to the general system sympathizing
with the affected part; but it is more probable that one organ
only is thus, at least in the first instance, acted on sympathetically,
namely, the heart. The effects of mechanical injuries are still more
in point. Wounds of the stomach may prove fatal before inflammation
can begin; rupture from over-distension may cause instant death;
and in either case without material hemorrhage.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>These observations being held in view, it is impossible to doubt,
that some organs sympathize with certain impressions made on others
at a distance; nor can we imagine any other mode of conveyance
for these impressions except along the nerves. The question, then,
comes to be what are the impressions that may be so transmitted?</p>

<p class='c006'>The statements already made will prepare us to expect a sympathetic
action in the case of poisons that manifestly injure the structure
of the organ to which they are applied. In the instance of the pure
corrosives its existence may be presumed from the identity of the
phenomena of their remote action with those of natural disease or
mechanical injury. It was stated above that the mineral acids when
swallowed often prove fatal in a very short space of time; and here,
as in mere injury from disease or violence, the symptoms are an imperceptible
pulse, fainting, and mortal weakness. Remote organs
therefore must be injured; and from the identity of the phenomena
with those of idiopathic affections of the stomach, even if there were
no other proof, it might be presumed that the primary impression is
conveyed along the nerves. We are not restricted, however, to such
an argument: The presumptive inference is turned to certainty by
the effect of dilution on the activity of these poisons. Dilution materially
lessens or even takes away altogether the remote action of
the mineral acids. Now dilution facilitates, instead of impeding
their absorption: consequently they do not act on remote organs
through that channel. There is no other way left by which we can
conceive them to act, except by conveyance of the local impression
along the nerves.—As to the irritants that are not corrosive, it can
hardly be doubted, since they inflame the stomach, that the usual
remote effects of inflammation will ensue, namely, a sympathetic injury
of distant organs.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it remains to be considered, whether distant organs may sympathize
also with the peculiar local impressions called nervous,—which
are not accompanied by any visible derangement of structure.
This variety of action by sympathy is the one which has chiefly engaged
the attention of toxicologists; and it has been freely resorted
to for explaining the effects of many poisons. Nevertheless its existence
is doubtful.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only important arguments in support of the sympathetic action
of poisons are, that unequivocal instances exist of local nervous impressions
being conveyed to a limited extent along the nerves,—and
that the rapidity of the effects of some poisons is so great as to be
incompatible with any other medium of action except the nervous
system.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first place it is maintained, that a limited nervous transmission,
that is, the conveyance of a local impression, purely functional
in its nature, to parts at a short distance from the texture acted on directly,
must occur in some instances,—as, for example, in the action
of belladonna in dilating the pupil when applied to the conjunctiva of
the eye, and in the effect of opium in allaying deep-seated pain when
applied to the integuments over the affected part. It is by no means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>clear, however, that nervous transmission is in such circumstances the
only possible medium of action; and that the phenomena may not
as well be owing to the agent being conveyed in substance, by imbibition
or absorption, to the parts ultimately acted on. It is not unworthy
of remark too, that in the case of hydrocyanic acid,—a poison,
which, more perhaps than any other, has been held to act by sympathy,
and which produces on the integuments a direct local impression
of a peculiar and unequivocal kind,—there is positive evidence of
the direct impression not being conveyed along the nerves, even to
the most limited distance; for I have not been able to observe the
slightest effect beyond the abrupt line on the skin which defines the
spot with which the acid had been in contact.</p>

<p class='c006'>Secondly, it is thought that certain poisons, such as hydrocyanic
acid, strychnia, alcohol, conia, and some others, produce their remote
effects with a velocity, which is incompatible with any conceivable
mode of action except the transmission of a primary local
impulse along the nerves, and more especially incompatible with the
poison having followed the circuitous route of the circulation to the
organs which are affected by it remotely. Thus in regard to the hydrocyanic
acid, Sir B. Brodie has stated,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> that a drop of the essential
oil of bitter almonds, which owes its power to this acid, caused
convulsions instantly when applied to the tongue of a cat; and that
happening once to taste it himself, he had scarcely applied it to his
tongue, when he felt a sudden momentary feebleness of his limbs,
so that he could scarcely stand. Magendie,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> speaking of the pure
hydrocyanic acid, compares it in point of swiftness of action to the
cannon ball or thunderbolt. In the course of certain experiments
made not long ago with the diluted acid by Dr. Freer, Mr. Macaulay and
others,<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> to decide the true rapidity of this poison, several dogs were
brought under its influence in ten, eight, five, and even three seconds;
during an experimental inquiry I afterwards undertook for the same
purpose,<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> I remarked on one occasion that a rabbit was killed outright
in four seconds; and Mr. Taylor has more recently stated, that
he has seen the effects induced so quickly in cats, that there was no
sensible interval of time between the application of the poison to the
tongue and the first signs of poisoning.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Strychnia, the active principle
of nux-vomica, acts sometimes with a speed little inferior to
that of hydrocyanic acid; for Pelletier and Caventou have seen its
effects begin in fifteen seconds.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> Alcohol, according to Sir B. Brodie,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a>
also acts on animals with equal celerity; for when he introduced
it into the stomach of a rabbit, its effects began when the injection
was hardly completed. Conia, the active principle of hemlock,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>is not less prompt in its operation: when it was injected in the
form of muriate into the femoral vein of a dog, I was unable, with
my watch in my hand, to observe an appreciable interval between
the moment it was injected and that in which the animal died;<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a>
certainly the interval did not exceed three or at most four seconds.</p>

<p class='c006'>Facts such as these have been long held adequate to prove that
some poisons must act on remote organs by sympathy or transmission
of a local impulse along the nerves; and in the last edition of this
work they were acknowledged to warrant such a conclusion. It
was thought difficult to account for the phenomena on the supposition
that the poison was conveyed in substance with the blood to the
organ remotely affected by it; for it appeared impossible that, in so
short a space of time as elapsed in some of the instances now referred
to, the poison could enter the veins of the texture to which it was
applied, pass into the right side of the heart, follow the circle of the
pulmonary circulation into the left side of the heart, and thence be
transmitted by the arterial system to the capillaries of the organ ultimately
affected. But the progress of physiological discovery has
lately brought the soundness of these views into question. Some
years ago Dr. Hering of Stuttgardt showed that the round of the circulation
may be accomplished by the blood much more speedily than
had been conceived before; for the ferro-cyanide of potassium, injected
into the jugular vein of a horse, was discovered by him throughout
the venous system at large in the short space of twenty or thirty
seconds, and consequently must have passed in that period throughout
the whole double circle of the pulmonary and systemic circulation.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a>
This discovery at once shook the validity of many, though
not all, of the facts which had been previously referred to the agency
of nervous transmission on the ground of the celerity with which the
effects of poisons are manifested. More recently an attempt has been
made by Mr. Blake to prove, that the circulation is so rapid as to
admit even of the swiftest cases of poisoning being referred to the
agency of absorption. Mr. Blake, who is altogether opposed to the
occurrence of nervous transmission in the instance of any poison, has
found that ammonia, injected into the jugular vein of a dog, was
indicated in its breath in four seconds; and that chloride of barium
or nitrate of baryta, introduced into the same vessel, could be detected
in the blood of the carotid artery in about sixteen seconds in
the horse, in less than seven seconds in the dog, in six seconds in
the fowl, and in four seconds in the rabbit.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> These interesting discoveries,
however, will not absolutely destroy the conclusiveness of
all the facts quoted above in support of the existence of a sympathetic
action. For example they do not shake the validity of those observations,
in which it appeared that an interval inappreciable, or barely
appreciable, elapsed between the application and action of hydrocyanic
acid and of conia. Mr. Blake indeed denies the accuracy of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>these observations, insisting that, in those he made himself with the
most potent poisons, he never failed to witness, before the poison
began to act, an interval considerably longer than what had been
observed by others, and longer also than what he had found sufficient
for the blood to complete the round of the circulation; that, for example,
the wourali poison injected into the femoral or jugular vein
did not begin to act for twenty seconds, conia and tobacco for fifteen
seconds, and extract of nux vomica for twelve seconds; and that
hydrocyanic acid dropped on the tongue did not act for eleven seconds
if the animal was allowed to inhale its vapour, and not for
sixteen seconds, if direct access to the lungs was prevented by making
the animal breathe through a tube in the windpipe. But Mr. Blake
cannot rid himself thus summarily of the positive facts which stand
in his way. Duly weighed, the balance of testimony is in favour of
those whose accuracy he impugns. For in the first place, they had
not, like him, a theory to build up with their results, but were observing,
most of them at least, the simple fact of the celerity of action.
Then, their result is an affirmation or positive statement, and his
merely a negative one: They may perfectly well have observed
what he was not so fortunate as to witness. And lastly, it is not
unreasonable to claim for Sir B. Brodie, Dr. Freer, Mr. Macaulay,
and Mr. Taylor, all of them practitioners of experience, the faculty
of noting time as accurately as Mr. Blake himself. As for my own
observations, I feel confident they could not have been made more
carefully, and that I had at the moment no preconceived views
which the results upheld, but, if anything, rather the reverse.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is impossible therefore to concede, that Mr. Blake’s inquiries,
merely because they are at variance with prior results, apparently
not less precise and exact than his own, put an end to the argument
which has been drawn, in favour of the existence of a sympathetic
action, from the extreme swiftness of the operation of some poisons.
At the same time, on a dispassionate view of the whole investigation,
it must be granted to be doubtful, whether this argument can be now
appealed to in its present shape with the confidence which is desirable.
And on the whole, the velocity of the circulation on the one
hand, and the celerity of the action of certain poisons on the other,
are both of them so very great, and the comparative observation of
the time occupied by the two phenomena respectively becomes in
consequence so difficult and precarious, that it seems unsafe to found
upon such an inquiry a confident deduction on either side of so important
a physiological question as the existence or non-existence of
an action of poisons by sympathy.</p>

<p class='c006'>In concluding these statements it is necessary to notice certain
positive arguments which have been brought against the doctrine of
nervous transmission.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is alleged to be contrary to nature’s rule to adopt two ways of
attaining the same end; and therefore, that, since many poisons undoubtedly
act through absorption, it is unphilosophical to hold that
others act by sympathy. There seems no sound reason, however, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>thus imposing arbitrary limits on the functional powers conferred by
nature on the organs of the animal body. And besides, the presumption
thus derived is counterbalanced by the equally plausible supposition,
that,—since nature has clearly established an action on remote
organs through the medium of the nerves in the case of poisons
which cause destruction or inflammation of the tissues to which they
are applied,—the same medium of action may also exist in the instance
of poisons which produce merely a peculiar nervous impression
where they are applied.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it is farther alleged, that poisons of the most energetic action
have no effect, when they are applied to a part, the connection of
which with the general system is maintained by nerves only. It is
true that poisons seem to have no effect whatever when the circulation
of the part to which they are applied has been arrested, or when
every connecting tissue has been severed except the nerves. Thus
Emmert found that the wourali poison does not act on an animal
when introduced into a limb connected with the body by nerves
alone.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> And I have ascertained that in the same circumstances no
effect is produced on the dog by pure hydrocyanic acid dropped into
the cellular tissue of the paw. But it cannot be inferred absolutely
from these facts, that the wourali poison and hydrocyanic acid do
not act through sympathy; because it has been urged that the integrity
of the functions of the sentient extremities of the nerves, more
especially their capability of receiving those nervous impressions
which are held to be communicated backwards along their course,
may be interrupted by arresting the circulation of the part. Still, as
the function of sensation is maintained for some time in a severed
limb connected with the trunk by nerves only, there is a probability,
that all other functions of the nerves must be retained for a time also.
And the presumption thus arising is strengthened by an imperfect
experiment performed by Mr. Blake, which tends to show, although
it does not absolutely prove, that a poison, introduced into the severed
limb whose nervous connection with the trunk is entire, will
not act, even if the blood be allowed to enter the limb by its artery
and to escape from a wound in its vein, so that local circulation is
in some measure maintained, without the blood returning to the trunk
and general system.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>On considering impartially all the facts that have been adduced in
this inquiry, an impression must be felt that the doctrine of the sympathetic
action of those poisons which produce merely a nervous local
impression is insecurely founded. But an <i>experimentum crucis</i> is
still wanted to decide the question.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. <i>Of the Action of Poisons through Absorption.</i>—If doubts may be
entertained whether poisons ever act by the transmission of local
impulses, from the part to which they are applied, along the nerves
to the organ upon which they act, no reasonable doubt can be entertained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>that many poisons act through the medium of absorption into
the blood.</p>

<p class='c006'>Poisons are believed to act through the blood for the following
reasons. First, they disappear during life from the shut cavities or
other situations into which they have been introduced; that is, they
are absorbed. Several clear examples to this effect have been related
by Dr. Coindet and myself in our paper on oxalic acid. In
one experiment four ounces of a solution of oxalic acid were injected
into the peritoneal sac of a cat, and killed it in fourteen minutes;
yet, on opening the animal, although none of the fluid had escaped
by the wound, we found scarcely a drachm remaining.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a> In recent
times Professor Orfila has proved that various poisons, such as arsenic,
tartar-emetic, and acetate of lead, disappear in part or wholly from
wounds into which they had been introduced.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a> Next, many poisons
act with unimpaired rapidity, when the nerves supplying the part to
which they are applied have been previously divided, or even when
the part is attached to the body by arteries and veins only. Dr.
Monro, <i>secundus</i>, proved this in regard to opium;<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> and the same
fact has been since extended by Sir B. Brodie and Professor Emmert
to wourali,<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a> by Magendie to nux vomica,<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a> by Coullon to hydrocyanic
acid,<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a> by Charret to opium,<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a> and by Dr. Coindet and myself
to diluted oxalic acid.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a> Magendie’s experiment was the most precise
of all: for, besides the communication with the poisoned part
being kept up by a vein and an artery only, these vessels were also
severed and reconnected by two quills. Farther, many poisons will
not act when they are applied to a part of which the circulation has
been arrested, even although all its other connections with the body
have been left entire. This has been shown distinctly by Emmert
in regard to the hydrocyanic acid; which, when introduced into the
hind-leg of an animal after the abdominal aorta has been tied, produces
no effect till the ligature be removed, but then acts with
rapidity.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c013'><sup>[28]</sup></a> An experiment of a similar nature performed by Mr.
Blake with the wourali poison yielded the same result.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a> Again,
many poisons act with a force proportional to the absorbing power
of the texture with which they are placed in contact. This is the
criterion which has been commonly resorted to for discovering whether
a poison acts through the medium of the blood. It is applicable,
however, only when the poison acts sensibly in small doses; for
those which act but in large doses cannot be applied in the same
space of time over equal surfaces of different textures. The difference
in the absorbing power of the different tissues has been well ascertained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>in respect to a few of them only. The most rapid channel of
absorption is by a wound, or by immediate injection into a vein; the
surface of the serous membranes is a less rapid medium, and the mucous
membrane of the alimentary canal is still less rapid. Now it is
proved of many poisons that, when applied in similar circumstances
to these several parts or tissues, their activity is proportional to the
order now laid down. Lastly, it has been proved of nux-vomica,
that if the extract be thrust into the paw of an animal after a ligature
has been tightened round the leg so as to stop the venous, but not
the arterial circulation of the limb, blood drawn from an orifice in a
vein between the wound and the ligature, and transfused into the
vein of another animal, will excite in the latter the usual effects of
the poison, so as even to cause death; while, on the contrary, the
animal from which the blood has been taken will not be affected at
all, if a sufficient quantity be withdrawn before the removal of the
ligature. These interesting facts, which are capable of important
practical applications, were ascertained by M. Vernière.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c013'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>On weighing attentively the arguments here brought forward, it
seems impossible to doubt, that some poisons are absorbed into the
blood before they act, and that their entrance into the blood is not a
mere fortuitous antecedent, but a condition essential to their action.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it is farther held that poisons which act through absorption, do
so by being conveyed in substance along with the blood to the part
where their action is developed,—that their action eventually depends
on the organ, whose functions are thrown into disorder, becoming
impregnated with poisoned blood. Now, the arguments detailed
above do not absolutely prove this conveyance and impregnation.
They show that poisons enter the blood, and act somehow in
consequence of entering it; but they do not prove in what manner
the action subsequently takes place.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was at one time indeed supposed that the same facts, which
prove their admission into the blood, proved also their transmission
in substance to the organs acted on by them. But Dr. Addison and
Mr. Morgan have shown that this is not a legitimate conclusion, and
that a different theoretical view may be taken of the facts,—namely,
that the action may really take place by the poison producing on the
sentient extremities of the nerves of the inner membrane of the
blood-vessels a peculiar impression which is conveyed through the
nerves to the part ultimately affected.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c013'><sup>[31]</sup></a> They have endeavoured to
found this theory upon evidence, that the poison is not carried beyond
the venous system; or that, if conveyed farther, it is carried incidentally,
and not for the purpose of impregnating the textures of the
organ which suffers. The evidence they have brought forward on
this head is chiefly the following. 1. Poisons which act on a particular
organ at a distance do not act more quickly when introduced
into the artery which supplies it, than when introduced into its vein,
or even into the principal artery of a distant part of the body.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c013'><sup>[32]</sup></a> 2.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>If a poison be introduced into a great vein with a provision for preventing
its passage towards the heart, it will act with as great rapidity,
as if no obstacle of the kind existed. Thus, if the jugular
vein, secured by two temporary ligatures, be divided between them
and reconnected by a tube containing wourali, the animal will not
be affected more quickly on the removal of both ligatures, than on
removing only the ligature farthest from the heart.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c013'><sup>[33]</sup></a> 3. The arterial
blood of a poisoned animal is incapable of affecting another animal.
Thus, if the carotid artery and jugular vein of one dog be divided,
and both ends of each reciprocally connected by tubes with the divided
ends of the corresponding vessels of another dog, and extract of
nux-vomica be introduced into a wound in the face of one of them,—the
animal directly poisoned alone perishes, and the other remains
unharmed to the last.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c013'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>These are at first view strong arguments against the transmission
of poisons with the blood to the organs remotely acted on; and the
facts on which they are founded are on the other hand easily explained
under the new theory advanced by the authors, that the medium of
action is the nerves which supply the inner membrane of the blood-vessels.
But their inquiries, however ingenious and plausible, have
not stood the test of physiological scrutiny. Their first experimental
fact has been contradicted by Mr. Blake; who has found that the
wourali poison, which does not begin to act for twenty seconds when
injected into a vein, will produce obvious effects in seven seconds
only if injected into the aorta through the axillary artery.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c013'><sup>[35]</sup></a> The second
experiment, showing that poison confined in a vein will act although
prevented by a ligature from reaching the heart, is held by the opponents
of Dr. Addison and Mr. Morgan to be fallacious, in as much
as the blood behind the ligature may be carried backwards till it
meets with an anastomosing vein and is so carried by a collateral
vessel to the heart. To the third experiment it may be objected,
that there was, in the mode in which they conducted it, no satisfactory
evidence that the reciprocal circulation was kept up by the
carotid artery and jugular vein. And this will appear an important
objection to every one practically acquainted with experiments of
transfusion. For on the one hand it is exceedingly difficult, in such
complicated experiments, to prevent coagulation of the blood in one
vessel or another, before the connection of all the arteries and veins
is established; and on the other, it may be urged, as Mr. Blake has
done, that the pressure of the blood in the distal end of the carotid
artery in the animal not directly poisoned may be equal, or even
superior, to the pressure in the proximal end of the same vessel in the
other animal,—so that the blood may not pass from the latter into
the former, although it should continue fluid.</p>

<p class='c006'>In opposition to the theory of Dr. Addison and Mr. Morgan, and
in support of the doctrine, that poisons act by being carried in substance
with the blood into the tissues of the remote organs on which
they act, a variety of important experimental evidence has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>brought forward since the publications of the Essay of these gentlemen.
In the first place, the concurrent testimony of a great number
of recent chemical inquirers establishes undeniably, that poisons absorbed
into the veins of the part to which they are applied are to be
detected throughout many of the tissues of distant organs. This fact
will be enlarged on and illustrated presently. Secondly, on the authority
of Mr. Blake, and in contradiction of the experiments of Dr.
Addison and Mr. Morgan, it appears that, as already stated, poisons
act more quickly when injected into the aorta than into the venous
system; a fact which is easily understood, on considering that when
injected into the aorta they reach their destination directly, whereas,
if injected into a vein they must first arrive at the right side of the
heart, and then be transmitted through the circle of the pulmonary
circulation before reaching even the aorta. Thirdly, the relative rapidity
with which poisons act on different animals follows the ratio of
the velocity of the circulation in each. Thus, Mr. Blake found, that
in the horse nitrate of baryta is conveyed by the circulation from the
jugular vein to the carotid artery in sixteen seconds, and that strychnia
injected into the jugular vein begins to act on the nervous system
after exactly the same interval: That in the dog chloride of barium
passes from the vein to the artery in seven seconds, and extract of
nux-vomica begins to act as a poison in twelve seconds: That in the
fowl the passage of the blood seems to take place in six seconds,
and the nitrate of strychnia to act in six seconds and a half: And that
in the rabbit the passage of the blood is effected in four seconds only,
and the first signs of the action of strychnia occur in four seconds
and a half.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c013'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>On the whole, then, it may be considered as well established,
that probably all, but certainly some, poisons,—of the kind whose
topical action does not consist in causing destruction or inflammation
of the textures to which they are applied,—produce their remote
effects solely by entering the blood, and through its means impregnating
the organs which are acted on at a distance. And farther,
if this doctrine be admitted as established, it may also be allowed,
that many poisons which do cause topically destruction or inflammation,
and remotely the usual sympathetic effects of these changes of
structure, also possess the power of affecting distant organs through
the medium of the blood.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of the discovery of Poisons in the Blood.</i>—Such being the case,
it becomes an object of paramount interest, with reference both to
the practice of medical jurisprudence, to inquire whether poisons
can be detected in the circulating fluids, or generally in parts of the
body remote from the place where they are introduced.</p>

<p class='c006'>A variety of circumstances long rendered it impossible to determine
satisfactorily the question, whether poisons could be detected
in the blood, the secretions, and the soft textures of the body. In
the first place, we now know that the quantity of the more active
poisons, which is required to occasion death, is so small, that, considering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>the crude methods of analysis formerly trusted to, and the
obstacles opposed to the successful application of them by the presence
of organic matter, there can be no wonder that chemists, even
but a few years ago, could not satisfy themselves whether the objects
they were in search of had been detected or not. Then, it was partly
known before, and is now fully established, that various poisons
are removed beyond the reach of analysis before death, in consequence
of passing off with the secretions, particularly the urine.
Farther, it seems probable that, of the poisons which act through
absorption, several do not remain or at least do not accumulate, in
the blood; and that they are not distributed with it throughout the
textures indifferently, but are deposited, as absorption goes on, in
particular organs, such as the liver,—which it was not much the
practice to examine in former investigations. And lastly, some
poisons are speedily decomposed on entering the blood: They either
cause obvious changes in the constitution of the blood, and themselves
undergo alteration likewise; or without the blood becoming
appreciably different in its properties from the healthy state, the
poison undergoes a rapid change in the molecular affinities of its
elements, and so disappears. Of the former course of things distinct
illustrations are furnished by nitric oxide gas and sulphuretted-hydrogen
gas when injected into a vein in a living animal: of the
latter an equally unequivocal example occurs in oxalic acid, which
Dr. Coindet and I found to be undiscoverable in the blood of the
vena cava of a dog killed in thirty seconds by the injection of eight
grains and a half of it into the femoral vein.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the improvements that have been lately made in the methods
of analysis for the detection of poisons in a state of complex mixture
with organic substances have done away with a great part of
the obstacles which prevented a thorough inquiry as to the existence
of poisons in the blood and textures of the body. Some important
researches of this kind were referred to in the last edition of the
present work; and since then many additional facts, of equal variety
and precision, have been communicated by different observers, but
especially by Professor Orfila. Under the head of each poison an
account will be given hereafter of the evidence in support of the discovery
of it by chemical analysis in the blood, textures, and excretions.
In the present place it is sufficient to state in general terms
that the evidence is quite satisfactory in the instances of iodine, sal-ammoniac,
oxalic acid, nitre, sulphuret of potassium, arsenic, mercury,
copper, antimony, tin, silver, zinc, bismuth, lead, hydrocyanic
acid, cyanide of potassium, carbazotic acid, sulphuretted-hydrogen,
camphor, and alcohol.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of the Organs affected by the remote action of Poisons.</i>—Having
now taken a general view of the mode in which poisons act on distant
parts, I shall next consider what organs are thus brought under
their operation. Poisons have been often, but erroneously, said to
affect remotely the general system. A few of them, such as arsenic
and mercury, do indeed appear to affect very many organs of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>body. But by much the larger proportion seem on the contrary to
act on one or more organs only, not on the general system.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of the poisons which act remotely through a sympathy of distant
parts with an organic injury of the textures directly acted on, many
appear to act sympathetically on the heart alone. Taking the mineral
acids as the purest examples of poisons that act independently of absorption
into the blood-vessels, it will be seen on inquiry that all the
symptoms they produce, in addition to the direct effects of the local
injury, are those of depressed action of the heart,—great feebleness,
fainting, imperceptible pulse, cold extremities. Even the less prominent
of the secondary symptoms are almost all referrible to a
depressed state of the circulation. In particular, they are not necessarily,
and indeed are seldom actually, blended with any material
symptom of disorder in the brain; which certainly could not be the
case if the general or whole system suffered.</p>

<p class='c006'>With respect to that more numerous class, which act remotely
either through the medium of the blood or by the transmission along
the nerves of an undiscernible impression made on their sentient extremities,
some certainly possess a very extended influence over the
great organs of the body; but the greater number are much more
limited in their sphere of action. Some act chiefly by enfeebling or
paralyzing the heart, others principally by obstructing the pulmonary
capillaries, others by obstructing the capillaries of the general system,
others by stimulating or depressing the functions of the brain or of
the spinal cord, others by irritating the alimentary canal, others by
stimulating one or another of the glandular organs, such as the salivary
glands, the liver, the kidneys, or the lymphatic glands.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some poisons of this kind act chiefly, if not solely, on the <i>heart</i>.
The best examples are infusion of tobacco, and upas antiar. Sir B.
Brodie observed, that when the infusion of tobacco was injected into
any part of the body, it speedily caused great faintness and sinking
of the pulse; and on examining the body instantly after death, he
found the heart distended and paralyzed, not excitable even by galvanism,
and its aortal cavities filled not with black, but with florid
blood, while the voluntary muscles were as irritable as after other
kinds of death.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c013'><sup>[37]</sup></a> The upas antiar he found to be similarly circumstanced.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c013'><sup>[38]</sup></a>
Arsenic and oxalic acid are also of this kind. In an
animal killed by arsenic, and in which the gullet and voluntary
muscles continued long contractile, Dr. Campbell found the heart
immediately after death containing arterial blood in its aortal cavities,
and insensible to galvanism.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c013'><sup>[39]</sup></a> Dr. Coindet and I frequently witnessed
the same facts in animals killed with oxalic acid: When the
heart at the moment of death was completely palsied and deprived
of irritability, we saw the intestines moving, and the voluntary
muscles contracting long and vigorously from the mere contact of
the air.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c013'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>An interesting series of investigations has been lately made by Mr.
Blake, relative to the influence of poisons on the heart, when they
are directly introduced into the great veins. It does not absolutely
follow that an action on the heart manifested in this way proves the
occurrence of a similar action when the substance is admitted into
the body through more ordinary channels, such as the stomach, intestines
or cellular tissue. For on the one hand, some of the substances
used by this physiologist cannot be admitted into the blood
through ordinary channels in the quantity necessary for developing
that action on the heart, which is excited when they are injected at
once into the blood-vessels. And on the other hand, the results at
which he thus arrives are not always in conformity with what have
been obtained by prior observers, who resorted to the ordinary channels
for introducing poisons into the body. It is possible, therefore,
that Mr. Blake’s researches may not have the extensive bearings,
which might at first sight appear, on the physiology of poisons and
remedies. Nevertheless they are in themselves full of interest.
They show that the salts of magnesia, zinc, copper, lime, strontia,
baryta, lead, silver, ammonia, and potash, also oxalic acid, and
digitalis, if injected into the jugular vein, produce a powerful and
permanent depression of the heart’s action; which is evinced by the
hæmadynamometer,<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c013'><sup>[41]</sup></a> indicating diminution of pressure in the great
arteries, by the heart becoming motionless or nearly so before the
breathing ceases, by its muscular structure presenting little or no
irritability when stimulated immediately after death, and by the left
cavities being found full of florid arterial blood.<a href='#f41' class='c013'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Other poisons act on the <i>lungs</i>; but probably few, perhaps none,
act on them alone. Magendie found that in poisoning with tartar-emetic
the lungs are commonly inflamed and sometimes even hepatized.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c013'><sup>[42]</sup></a>
Mr. Smith and M. Orfila both remarked similar signs of
pulmonary inflammation in animals poisoned with corrosive sublimate.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c013'><sup>[43]</sup></a>
But these poisons produce important effects on other organs
likewise.</p>

<p class='c006'>A set of novel and important facts setting forth the frequent operation
of poisons on the lungs when they are admitted directly into
the blood, has been recently brought to light by the researches of Mr.
Blake. Many of the poisons mentioned above as acting powerfully
on the heart were found by him not to exert any influence upon the
lungs, such as oxalic acid and the salts of magnesia, lime, zinc,
copper, ammonia, potash, and strychnia. Others, however, such as
the salts of strontia, baryta, lead, and silver, as well as digitalis, all of
which powerfully affect the heart, and, in addition to these, the salts
of soda, which have no action at all on the heart, and hydrocyanic
acid, tobacco, and euphorbium, which influence it feebly, or even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>dubiously,—produce, when injected into the jugular vein, obstruction
of the capillaries of the pulmonary circulation, and consequently
asphyxia. This is proved by the hæmadynamometer introduced into
a vein indicating great increase of pressure in the venous circulation
a few seconds after the introduction of the poison; by this
instrument introduced into the femoral artery indicating great diminution
of arterial pressure, although the heart continues to beat vigorously;
by the breathing becoming at the same time laborious, without
the heart suffering; by these symptoms preceding any signs of action
on the nervous system; by the heart pulsating for some time after
death; and in many instances by frothy mucus having accumulated
in the air-passages, and congestion and extravasation having taken
place in the lungs themselves.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c013'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>A great number of the poisons whose action is remote, operate on
the <i>brain</i>. The most decided proof of such an action is the nature
of the symptoms; which are, giddiness, delirium, insensibility,
convulsions, palsy, coma. Some physiologists have also sought for
evidence in the body after death, and have imagined they found it in
congestion of the vessels in the brain, and even extravasation of blood
there; but it will be seen under the head of Narcotic Poisons that
such appearances are far from being essential, and indeed are seldom
witnessed. All narcotic poisons act on the brain, and most narcotico-acrids
too; but very frequently other organs are affected at the same
time, and in particular the spine and heart.</p>

<p class='c006'>The influence of poisons on the brain seems to be sometimes induced,
not immediately, but indirectly through the intervention of a
more direct influence on the pulmonary circulation. Thus Mr. Blake
appears to have succeeded in proving that the insensibility and tetanic
convulsions which immediately precede death, when certain substances,
such as the salts of soda, are injected into the veins, depend
simply on the obstruction directly produced in the pulmonary circulation
causing increased pressure in the systemic veins, and
consequently upon the brain and nervous centre generally. For
when the jugular vein was opened after the development of tetanic
convulsions, and blood was allowed to flow out, the nervous symptoms
ceased, and the animal continued for two hours sensible and without
any return of convulsions, dying eventually of hemorrhage.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c013'><sup>[45]</sup></a> But
more generally the effect produced on the brain is direct and specific.
Thus opium and its active principle morphia suspend the functions of
external relation, which are peculiarly dependent on the brain; while
for a long time the respiration and circulation are little affected.
Even when the poison is admitted directly into the veins, the pulmonary
capillaries are not obstructed, and the heart is only somewhat
enfeebled in its contractions;<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c013'><sup>[46]</sup></a> and in ordinary cases of poisoning
with these substances the heart continues to pulsate, and the lungs
also discharge their office, long after sensibility is extinguished and
voluntary motion arrested,—until at length the circulation and respiration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>become affected consecutively by the depressed state of the
nervous system.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some poisons act specifically on the <i>spinal cord</i>. Those which
are best known to possess such an action are nux-vomica, the other
species of plants which, like it, contain strychnia, and also conia and
the wourali poison. The tribe of poisons of which nux-vomica may
be taken as the type excite violent fits of tetanus, during the intervals
of which the mind and external senses are quite entire; and death
takes place during a paroxysm, apparently from suffocation caused
by spasmodic fixing of the chest. Their action on the spine is quite
independent of any action on the brain; if indeed such action exist
at all. For when the spinal cord is separated from the brain by
dividing the medulla oblongata, the effects on the muscles supplied
by the spinal cord are produced as usual.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c013'><sup>[47]</sup></a> Conia, the active principle
of hemlock, according to my own researches, produces in the
lower animals, howsoever introduced, gradually increasing paralysis,
without insensibility or delirium, and without the circulation or
respiration being for some time affected, till at length death takes
place from stoppage of the breathing by palsy of the respiratory
muscles; and after death the heart continues beating vigorously,
the muscles contract when irritated, and arterialization of the blood
in the lungs may be kept up long by maintaining artificial respiration.
In this instance it would appear, that the first effect is arrestment
of the functions of the spinal cord; that the paralysis does not
depend upon a direct action on the muscles; and that neither the
brain, heart, nor lungs can be influenced, except secondarily through
the consequences of general muscular paralysis.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c013'><sup>[48]</sup></a> Many poisons
which act on the brain also act on the spinal cord.</p>

<p class='c006'>Other poisons apparently possess the singular property of impeding
or arresting the <i>general capillary circulation</i>, and produce their tangible
effects more or less through the medium of this operation.
Such at least are the inferences which seem to flow from the researches
of Mr. Blake; who found that many substances, soon after
they are injected backwards by the axillary artery into the aorta,
produce increased pressure in the arterial system indicated by the
hæmadynamometer during life, and frequently congestion of the membranous
textures as observed after death. Some substances have no
effect of this kind. Others act on the general capillaries in concurrence
with a similar action on the capillaries of the pulmonary circulation,
such as the salts of strontia, baryta, lead, silver, and soda,
euphorbium, tobacco and digitalis. But a few, such as potash and
ammonia, with their salts, seem to influence the capillaries of the
general circulation only.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c013'><sup>[49]</sup></a> These are important conclusions, if legitimate;
but it cannot be denied, that the facts on which they are
based must be very difficult to isolate and observe with accuracy and
without bias.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>The organs not immediately necessary to life may be likewise all
acted on by poisons indirectly. On this subject details are not called
for at present. It may be sufficient to remark that there is hardly a
considerable organ in the body, except perhaps the spleen and pancreas,
which is not acted on by one poison or another. Arsenic inflames
the alimentary mucous membrane, mercury the salivary organs
and mouth, cantharides the urinary organs, chromate of potass the
conjunctiva of the eyes, manganese the liver; iodine acts on the
lymphatic glands; lead on the muscles; and spurred rye causes gangrene
of the limbs.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some poisons, as was already mentioned, may act on one important
organ only, every other being left undisturbed: thus nux-vomica in
general acts only on the spine. But much more commonly they act
on several organs at once; and the action of some of them is complicated
in an extreme degree. I may instance oxalic acid and arsenic.
Oxalic acid when swallowed irritates and inflames the stomach directly,
and acts indirectly on the brain, the spine, and the heart. A large
dose causes sudden death by paralyzing the heart; if the dose is
somewhat less, the leading symptom is violent tetanic spasm, indicating
an action on the spine, and death takes place during a paroxysm,
the heart continuing to contract for some time after; if the
dose is still less, the spasms, at first distinct, become by degrees
fainter and fainter, while the sensibility in the intervals, at first unimpaired,
becomes gradually clouded, till at length pure coma is
formed without convulsions,—thus indicating an action on the brain.
As for arsenic, coupling together the symptoms during life and the
appearances in the dead body, it will be seen afterwards to have the
power of acting on the brain, heart, and lungs,—the throat, gullet,
stomach, and intestines,—the lining membrane of the nostrils and eyelids,—the
kidneys, bladder, and vagina; and, what is remarkable,
proofs of an action on all these parts may be witnessed in the course
of a single case. The effects of mercury are hardly less multifarious.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section II.</span>—<i>On the Causes which modify the Actions of Poisons.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>By a variety of causes the action of poisons may be modified both
in degree and in kind. The most important of them are—quantity;
state of aggregation; state of chemical combination; mixture; difference
in tissue; difference in organ; habit; idiosyncrasy; and
lastly, certain states of disease.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <i>Quantity</i> affects their action materially. Not only do they produce
their effects more rapidly in large doses; it is sometimes even
quite altered in kind. A striking example has just been related in
the case of oxalic acid; which, according to the dose, may corrode
the stomach, or act on the heart, or on the spine, or on the brain.
In like manner arsenic in a small dose may cause gastritis of several
days’ duration; while a large dose may prove fatal in two or three
hours by affecting the action of the heart. White hellebore in small
doses excites inflammation in the stomach and bowels, in larger doses
giddiness, convulsions, coma; and in either way it may prove fatal.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>2. <i>As to state of aggregation</i>,—poisons act the more energetically
the more minutely they are divided, and hence most energetically
when in solution. Some which are very energetic in the fluid state,
hardly act at all when undissolved. Morphia, the alkaloid of opium,
may be given in powder to a dog without injury in a dose, which,
if dissolved in oil or alcohol, would soon kill several. Previously
dissolving poisons favours their action in two ways,—by diffusing
them quickly over a large surface, and by fitting them for entering
the bibulous vessels. Poisons, before being absorbed, must be dissolved;
and hence, those which act though solid and insoluble in
water, must, as a preliminary step, be dissolved by the animal fluids
at the mouths of the vessels. In this way the poisonous effects of
carbonate of baryta and arsenite of copper are explained; for though
insoluble in water, they are soluble in the juices of the stomach.</p>

<p class='c006'>Differences in aggregation, like differences in quantity, may affect
the kind as well as the degree of action. Camphor in fragments
commonly causes inflammation of the stomach; dissolved in spirit
or olive oil, it causes delirium or tetanus and coma.</p>

<p class='c006'>The reduction of certain poisons to the state of vapour serves the
same end as dissolving them. When poisons are to be introduced
by the skin, no previous operation is more effectual than that of converting
them into vapour.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The next modifying cause is <i>chemical combination</i>. This is
sometimes nothing more than a variety of the last. If a poison, in
combining with another substance, acquire greater solubility, it also
generally acquires greater activity, and <i>vice versa</i>: Morphia, itself
almost inert, because insoluble, becomes active by uniting with acids,
for they render it very soluble: Baryta as a very active poison, becomes
quite inert by uniting with sulphuric acid, for the sulphate of
baryta is altogether insoluble.</p>

<p class='c006'>In regard to the influence of chemical combination two general
laws may be laid down. One is, that <i>poisons which only act locally,
have their action much impaired or even neutralized, in their chemical
combinations</i>. Sulphuric acid and muriatic acid on the one hand,
and the two fixed alkalis on the other, possess a violent local action;
but if they are united so as to form sulphates or muriates, although
still very soluble, they become merely gentle laxatives. But the case
is altered if either of the combining poisons also act by entering the
blood. For the second general law is, that <i>the action of poisons
which operate by entering the blood, although it may be somewhat lessened,
cannot be destroyed or altered in their chemical combinations</i>.
Morphia acts like opium if dissolved in alcohol or fixed oil; if an
acid be substituted as the solvent, a salt is formed which is endowed
with the same properties: The sulphate, muriate, nitrate, acetate of
morphia all act like opium. Strychnia, arsenic, hydrocyanic acid,
oxalic acid, and many more come under the same denomination:
Each produces its peculiar effects, with whatever substance it is combined,
provided it do not become insoluble.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Blake has recently laid down what may be considered a branch
or corollary of the second of these general propositions, and has confirmed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>it by many appropriate experimental facts,—namely, that
<i>the salts of the same base produce the same actions, independently of
the acids with which they are combined</i>.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c013'><sup>[50]</sup></a> The law, however, is a more
general one, as given above, and was stated in former editions of the
present work. It applies not only to bases, but likewise to acids,
such as the hydrocyanic, oxalic, arsenious, and arsenic acids, and
also to neutral organic principles which act through the blood, such
as picrotoxin, colocynthin, elaterin, and narcotin.</p>

<p class='c006'>The same author considers it to be also a probable conclusion from
a variety of experiments on the salts of various bases, that <i>those salts
which are isomorphous, or possess the same crystalline form, are closely
allied in action</i>.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c013'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>4. The effect of <i>mixture</i> depends partly on the poisons being diluted.
Dilution, by prolonging the time necessary for their being
absorbed, commonly lessens their activity; yet not always; for if a
poison which acts through the blood is also a powerful irritant, moderate
dilution will enable it to enter the vessels more easily: a small
dose of concentrated oxalic acid acts feebly as an irritant or corrosive;
moderately diluted, it quickly enters the blood and causes
speedy death.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c013'><sup>[52]</sup></a> The effect of mixture may depend also in part on
the mere mechanical impediment interposed between the poison and
the animal membranes. This is particularly obvious when the mass
containing the poison is solid or pulpy; for then the first portions of
the poison that touch the membrane may cause an effort of the organ
to discharge the rest beyond the sphere of action,—if, for example,
it is the stomach,—by vomiting. The effect of mixture in interposing
a mechanical impediment is also well illustrated where the substance
mixed with the poison is a fine, insoluble powder, capable of
enveloping its several particles. Thus it is that small, yet poisonous
doses of arsenic may be swallowed and retained with impunity, if
mixed with finely powdered charcoal, magnesia, and probably cinchona-bark,
or the like. Besides diluting and mechanically obstructing
their application, the admixture of other substances may alter the
chemical nature of poisons, and so change their action.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is important to keep in view, that the influence of mixture may
be exerted in consequence of the cavity into which a poison is introduced
being at the time filled with contents. Some of the most powerful
and unerring poisons may in such circumstances altogether fail
to produce their usual effect, if speedily vomited. Thus Wibmer
notices the case of a man, who swallowed an ounce and a half of
arsenic after a very hearty meal, had merely a severe attack of vomiting
with subsequent colic, and got quite well in four days.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c013'><sup>[53]</sup></a> And
a still more pointed instance has been briefly mentioned by Dr. Booth
of Birmingham, where an ounce of corrosive sublimate was swallowed
after a full meal without any material ill consequence, vomiting having
been speedily induced.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c013'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>5. <i>Difference of tissue</i> is an interesting modifying power in a physiological
point of view, but does not bear so directly on medico-legal
practice as the rest, and may therefore be passed over cursorily.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the corrosives and irritants a difference of tissue acts but indirectly:
their effects vary not so much with the tissue as with the
organ of which it forms part. But as to poisons which act through
the blood, their energy must evidently depend on the activity of absorption
in each texture.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cutaneous absorption is slow, on account of the obstacle presented
by the cuticle, and by the intricate capillaries of the true skin.
Accordingly many active poisons are quite inert when applied to the
unbroken skin, or even to the skin deprived of the cuticle. Hydrocyanic
acid, perhaps the most subtle of all poisons, was found by
Coullon to have no effect when dropped on the skin of a dog.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c013'><sup>[55]</sup></a> Some
authors have even gone so far as to deny that poisons can be absorbed
at all through the skin, unless they are pressed by friction
through the cuticle. But this is an error; most gaseous poisons, such
as carbonic acid and sulphuretted hydrogen, and some solid poisons
when volatilized, such as the vapours of cinnabar, will act though
simply placed in contact with the skin; and there is distinct evidence
that corrosive sublimate will bring on mercurial action in the form of a
warm bath, or when used as a liniment.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines, poisons
act much more energetically than on the skin; which clearly depends
in a great measure on the superior rapidity of absorption there,—or,
according to some, on the facility with which poisons come in contact
with the sentient extremities of nerves.</p>

<p class='c006'>The serous membranes possess an activity of absorption which
hardly any other unbroken texture can equal. Accordingly many
poisons act much more rapidly through the peritonæum than through
the stomach. When oxalic acid is introduced under the same
collateral circumstances into the stomach of one dog and the peritonæum
of another, the dose may be so apportioned, that the same
quantity, which does not prove fatal to the former, kills the latter in
fourteen minutes.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c013'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>While the preceding modes in which poisons enter the blood are
indirect, they may be introduced directly by a wound in the vein.
There is no way in which poisons, that act through the blood, prove
more rapidly fatal. Some which act very slowly through the stomach
cause instant death when injected into a vein. A peculiar variety
of this mode of introducing poisons deserves to be distinguished,
namely, the application of them to a wound. If the surface bleeds
freely, they may not act at all, because they are washed away. But
if they adhere, they soon enter the divided veins. Hence, if they act
in small doses, this mode of applying them is hardly less direct than
if they were at once injected into a vein.</p>

<p class='c006'>So far the effect of difference in tissue has been determined.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Poisons that act through the blood act least energetically on the
skin, more actively on the alimentary mucous membrane, still more
so on serous membranes, and most powerfully of all when introduced
directly into a vessel. There are other textures, however,
which merit notice, although their place in the scale of activity has
not been exactly settled.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the mucous membrane of the pulmonary air-cells and tubes,
poisons act with a rapidity which is scarcely surpassed by their direct
introduction into a vein. This is plainly owing to the exceeding
delicacy and wide surface of the membrane. Hence three or
four inspirations of carbonic oxide gas will cause instant coma. A
single inspiration of the noxious gas of privies has caused instant extinction
of sense and motion. Nay, liquid poisons have been known
to act through the same channel with almost equal swiftness. For
M. Ségalas found that a solution of extract of nux-vomica caused
death in a few seconds when injected in sufficient quantity into the
windpipe; and that half a grain will thus kill a dog in two minutes,
while two grains will rarely prove fatal when injected into the stomach,
peritonæum, or chest.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c013'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>As to the nervous tissue, it is a fact worthy of mention, that the
poisons which appear to act on the sentient extremities of the nerves,
do not act at all on the cut surface of the brain and nerves, or upon
any part of the course of the latter. This has been proved with
respect to most active narcotics.</p>

<p class='c006'>The power of the cellular tissue as a medium of absorption, has not
been, and cannot easily be, ascertained. On the one hand it is difficult
to apply poisons to it, without also applying them to the mouths
of divided vessels; and, on the other hand, it is difficult to make a
set of experiments for comparison with others on the stomach, pleura,
or peritonæum, as the cellular tissue does not form an expanded cavity,
and consequently, the extent of surface to which a poison is
applied cannot be made the same in each experiment of a series. It
is a ready medium, however, for admitting poisons into the blood,
especially if an artificial cavity be made where the tissue is loose,
as, for example, by separating the skin from the muscles of the back
with the finger introduced through a small incision in the integuments.</p>

<p class='c006'>The variations caused by difference of tissue in the activity of poisons
have been viewed in the previous remarks as depending chiefly
on the relative quickness with which absorption goes on. But in
this way it is impossible to explain the whole amount of the differences
sometimes observed. Some poisons cause death when applied
to a wound in the minutest quantity, but are quite harmless when
swallowed in large doses: Others are diminished a little in activity,
but still remain powerful and fatal poisons. There is not much difference
in the power of arsenic when it is applied to different textures,
the skin excepted. But oxalic acid injected into the peritonæum
will act eight or ten times more rapidly than when swallowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>and the poison of the viper may prove fatal to a man through a wound
in almost invisible doses, while the whole poison of six vipers may
be swallowed by so small a creature as a blackbird, with complete
impunity.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c013'><sup>[58]</sup></a> Differences in the absorbing power of the tissues cannot
explain these facts.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only rational way of accounting for them is by supposing that
a part of the poison is decomposed,—the change being greatest
where absorption is slowest and the power of assimilation strongest,
namely, in the stomach,—and least where absorption is quickest
and assimilation almost wanting, namely, in a wound. This explanation
derives support from the different effects of change of tissue
on poisons of the different kingdoms. Mineral poisons are least, and
animal poisons are most, affected in their action by differences of
tissue, while vegetable poisons hold the middle place:—an arrangement
which coincides with the respective difficulty of decomposition
among mineral, vegetable, and animal substances generally, whether
under physical or under vital processes.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c013'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>6. With respect to differences arising from <i>difference of organ</i>, these
will, of course, be partly attributable to differences in tissue, but not
altogether. For example, in the case of the pure corrosives or irritants,
the injury caused will depend for its danger on the importance
of the organ to the general economy of the body: Inflammation
caused by a local poison in the stomach will be more quickly fatal
than that excited in the intestines only; and such a poison may act
violently on the external parts without materially impairing the general
health.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. <i>Habit and Idiosyncrasy.</i>—The remarks to be made under the
present head are important in a medico-legal point of view: for they
show how one man may be poisoned by a substance generally harmless,
and another not harmed by a substance usually poisonous.</p>

<p class='c006'>The tendency of <i>idiosyncrasy</i> is generally to increase the activity
of poisons, or even to render some substances deleterious which are
commonly harmless.</p>

<p class='c006'>The effect of opium in medicinal doses is commonly pleasant and
salutary; but in some individuals it produces disagreeable and even
dangerous effects. Calomel, which in moderate doses is for the
most part a mild laxative or sialagogue, will cause in some people,
even in the dose of a few grains, violent salivation, ulceration of the
mouth, nay, fatal gangrene. On the other hand, a few substances,
which to most people are actively poisonous, have on some individuals
comparatively little effect. There are extremely few poisons,
however, in regard to which this kind of idiosyncrasy is well established
and prominent. Mercury and alcohol are examples. The
compounds of mercury, which in moderate quantity are mildly laxative
or sialagogue to most people, but to some persons dangerously
poisonous in very small doses, would, on the contrary, appear in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>other constitutions to be extremely inactive; for it has occasionally
been found impossible to bring on the peculiar constitutional action
of mercury by continuing the use of its preparations for months together.
In general children are not easily affected by calomel as a
sialagogue, but easily by its laxative action. As to alcohol, it is a
familiar fact, that independently of the effects of habit, there are some
constitutions which cannot be brought under the influence of intoxicating
liquors without an extraordinary quantity of them and a long-continued
debauch, while others are overpowered in a short space of
time, and by very moderate excess; and there is no reason to doubt
that very great constitutional differences also prevail in regard to the
operation of a single large dose. A rarer idiosyncrasy is unusual insensibility
to the action of opium. I am acquainted with a gentleman
unaccustomed to the use of opium who has taken without injury
nearly an ounce of good laudanum,—a dose which would certainly
prove fatal to most people.</p>

<p class='c006'>But not only does idiosyncrasy modify the action of poisons:
Through its means, too, some substances are actually poisonous to
certain individuals, which to mankind in general are unhurtful, nay,
even nutritive.</p>

<p class='c006'>With some people all kinds of red fish, trout, salmon, and even
the richer white fish, herring, mackerel, turbot, or holibut, disagree as
it is called—that is, act after the manner of poisons: They produce
fainting, sickness, pain of the stomach; and if they were not speedily
evacuated by vomiting, dangerous consequences might ensue. The
same is often the case with mushrooms. The esculent mushrooms
act on some people nearly in the same way as the poisonous varieties.
Bitter almonds and other vegetable substances that contain hydrocyanic
acid, sometimes produce stupor or nettle-rash in the small quantities
used for seasoning food. In like manner many flowers, which to
most persons are agreeable and not injurious, cannot be kept in the
same room with some people on account of the severe nervous affections
that are developed.</p>

<p class='c006'>This idiosyncrasy may even be acquired. One of my relations,
who was for many years violently affected by very small quantities of
the richer kinds of fish, used at a previous period to eat them, and can
now again do so, with impunity. Many people have acquired a similar
idiosyncrasy with respect to eggs; instances of the same kind will
be afterwards mentioned in respect to shell-fish, particularly muscles;
indeed there are probably few articles of food in regard to which such
idiosyncrasies may not in a few rare instances be met with, if we except
the grains and common kinds of butcher-meat. I may add, that
from facts which have come under my notice, I have sometimes
suspected that a similar idiosyncrasy may be acquired in a slight degree,
and for a short time only, in regard even to some kinds of butcher-meat,
especially the flesh of young animals and pork. On this subject
some illustrations will be found at the close of the chapter on diseased
and decayed animal matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>It does not appear well ascertained, that the effect of idiosyncrasy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>is ever to impair materially the energy of poisons, except in the instances
of mercury, alcohol, and opium.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the contrary, the tendency of <i>habit</i> when it does affect their
energy, is, with a few exceptions, to lessen it. By the force of habit
a person may take without immediate harm such enormous quantities
of some poisons as would infallibly kill an unpractised person or
himself when he began. There have been opium-eaters in this country
who took for days together ten or even seventeen ounces of laudanum
daily.</p>

<p class='c006'>The influence of habit has been ascertained precisely in the case
of a few common poisons only. On the whole, it would appear that
more change is effected by habit in the action of the organic than in
that of the inorganic poisons; and that of the former, those which
act on the brain and nervous system, and produce <i>narcotism</i>, are altered
in the most eminent degree. The best examples of the influence of
habit are opium and vinous spirits. The action of such poisons is not
always, however, entirely thrown away; they still produce some
immediate effect; and farther, by being frequently taken, they may
slowly bring on certain disease, or engender a predisposition to
disease. A very singular exception to this rule prevails in the instance
of tobacco; which, under the influence of habit, may be smoked
daily to a considerable amount, and, so far as yet appears, without any
cumulative effect on the constitution, like that of opium-eating or
drinking spirits.</p>

<p class='c006'>The inorganic poisons are most of them little impaired in activity
by the force of habit. The pure irritants, indeed, do lose a little of
their energy: for it seems that persons have acquired the power of
swallowing with impunity considerable doses of the mineral acids.
But as to inorganic poisons that enter the blood, habit certainly does
not diminish, probably rather increases, their power. There is no
satisfactory evidence, that a person by taking gradually-increasing
doses of arsenic may acquire the power of enduring a considerably
larger dose than when he began: On the contrary, the stomach
rather becomes more tender to the subsequent dose by each repetition.
I have little hesitation in avowing my disbelief of the alleged
cases of arsenic-eaters and corrosive-sublimate-eaters, who could
swallow whole drachms at once with impunity. Some have expressed
surprise at this statement having been made in former editions of
the present work, when there is such authority as Byron, Pouqueville,
&amp;c., for the hackneyed story of Soleyman, the sublimate-eater of Constantinople,
who lived to the age of a hundred, eating a drachm of corrosive
sublimate daily. I must avow, however, that such reporters of a feat
so very extraordinary, and where deception was so highly probable,
are to me no authority at all.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the relative influence of habit on poisons of the three kingdoms
of nature, a new argument will be discovered for the opinion given
above respecting the partial decomposition of organic poisons in some
of the tissues. In fact this partial decomposition accounts very well
for the effect of habit: The effect of habit is probably nothing more
than an increased power acquired by the stomach of decomposing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>poison,—just as it gradually acquires an increased facility in digesting
some alimentary substances which are at first very indigestible.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. The last modifying cause to be mentioned comprehends certain
<i>diseased states of the body</i>. The effect of disease, like that of habit,
is in general to impair the activity of poisons. But it is only in
the instance of a few diseases that this diminution is so strongly
marked as to be important in relation to medical jurisprudence.—In
the continued fever of this country there is a diminished susceptibility
of the constitutional action of mercury; and this peculiarity is very
strongly marked in the yellow fever, as well as in the bilious fevers
generally of tropical climates. In some varieties of typhoid fever
there is obviously a diminished sensibility to the action of wine and
other spirituous liquors; but this diminution in a great majority of
cases is much inferior to what some physicians have represented.—In
severe dysentery the susceptibility of the narcotic action of opium
is so much impaired, that a person unaccustomed to the use of that
drug, may continue to take daily, for several days together, a quantity
which might prove fatal to him in a state of health. In the
severe form which dysentery occasionally puts on in this country I
have known a patient take from twenty-four to thirty grains of opium
daily, and retain it all, without experiencing more than a mild narcotic
action.—In epidemic cholera the same insensibility has been
remarked to the operation of opium.—It also occurs in the instance
of excessive hemorrhagy.—According to the doctrines and practice
of the present dominant school in Italy, there is an unusual insensibility
during inflammatory dropsy to the irritant action of gamboge,
so that sixty or eighty grains may be taken without harm.—There is
no disease, however, in which the power of mitigating the action of
poisons is more remarkably exhibited, than in tetanus: It is often
scarcely possible to bring on the narcotic action of opium by any
doses which can be administered; calomel, too, acts with much less
energy than usual; and even common purgatives must be administered in
doses considerably larger than those required in most other disorders.—Mania
is similarly circumstanced: almost all remedies must be given
in increased doses, narcotic remedies in particular. But there is
good reason for believing that the impaired susceptibility of the action
of poisons remarked in this disorder is far from being always so
great as some have alleged.—Another disease allied to the last,
where the diminution of susceptibility is often great, is delirium tremens.
It has in particular been often found, that to produce sleep in
this disease opium must be given in frequent large doses,—so large
indeed, that they would undoubtedly prove fatal to a person in health.
At the same time it is worthy of remark, that in some cases of delirium
tremens, even violent in degree, the peculiarity now specified,
as I have myself several times witnessed, is far from being strongly
marked.—Hydrophobia always, and hysteria sometimes, impair the
activity of poisons. I have seen cases of hysteria, more particularly
those assuming the form of tetanus, where very large doses of opium
were required to produce a calmative effect and sleep; and in hydrophobia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>it is well shown that the narcotic action of opium is not
produced even by large doses often repeated.—The same state occurs
in excessive hemorrhage.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the operation of this class of modifying agents it is a general
law, to which there are probably few exceptions, that they chiefly
affect poisons of the organic kingdoms, and the narcotics above all.
At least in the instance of most mineral poisons their influence is very
inferior. Their operation may be accounted for in various ways.
Sometimes, as in dysentery and cholera, the poison is carried with
unusual rapidity through the alimentary canal. Sometimes again it
remains comparatively inert, because on account of the impaired activity
of absorption, it is not taken up with the usual quickness by
the absorbent vessels. And sometimes, as in the instance of tetanus,
mania, and rabies, the nervous system is in a state of peculiar excitement,
by which the customary action of the poison is in a great measure,
if not entirely, counteracted.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a few diseased states of the system there is an increased susceptibility
of the action of poisons: and it is important that the medical
jurist should attend to this circumstance. When a poison has a
tendency to bring on a peculiar pathological state of the system, or of
a particular organ, which state is also produced by a disease existing
at the time or impending, violent and even fatal consequences may
ensue from doses of poisons which in ordinary circumstances are innocuous
or beneficial. Thus in persons affected with apoplexy an
ordinary dose of opium may accelerate death; and in people even
with a mere tendency to apoplexy, if it is strongly marked, or appears
from what are called warning symptoms to be on the point of developing
itself, a common dose of such narcotics as occasion determination
to the brain may excite the apoplectic attack. Thus, too, in
cases of inflammatory disorders of the alimentary canal, irritating
substances, in doses not otherwise injurious, may produce dangerous
impressions on the tender membrane with which they come in contact.
But in respect to this last example, it must be remarked, that
the improvements or the caprice of medical practice have gone
directly in face of the rule, by suggesting that some internal inflammations
of the alimentary canal may be successfully treated with irritating
remedies.</p>

<p class='c006'>I might here perhaps have added among the causes which modify
the action of poisons, sleep, and the administration of other poisons.
The latter subject, however, will be better considered at the end of
the Individual Poisons, under the title of Compound Poisoning. The
former agent is of doubtful effect. Some observations on its influence
will be found in the chapter on the Evidence of General Poisoning,
p. <a href='#Page_41'>41</a>.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Application of the preceding remarks to the Treatment of Poisoning.</i>
As an appendix to what has been said respecting the physiological
action of poisons, and the causes by which it is liable to be modified,
I shall here state shortly certain applications to the treatment of
poisoning.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>In the instance of internal poisoning, the great object of the physician
is to administer an antidote or counter-poison. Antidotes are of
two kinds. One kind takes away the deleterious qualities of the
poison before it comes within its sphere of action, by altering its
chemical nature. The other controls the poisonous action after it has
begun, by exciting a contrary action in the system. In the early
ages of medicine almost all antidotes were believed to be of the latter
description, but in fact very few antidotes of the kind are known.</p>

<p class='c006'>Chemical antidotes operate in several ways, according to the mode
of action of the poison for which they are given. If the poison is a
pure corrosive, such as a mineral acid, it will be sufficient that the
antidote destroy its corrosive quality: Thus the addition of an alkali
or earth will neutralize sulphuric acid, and destroy or at least prodigiously
lessen its poisonous properties. In applying this rule care
must be taken to choose an antidote which is either inert in itself, or,
if poisonous, is, like the poison for which it is given, a pure corrosive
or local irritant, and one whose properties are reciprocally neutralized.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the poison, on the other hand, besides possessing a local action,
likewise acts remotely through absorption, or by an impression on
the inner coat of the vessels, mere neutralization of its chemical properties
is not sufficient; for we have seen above that such poisons
act throughout all their chemical combinations which are soluble.
Here, therefore, it is necessary that the chemical antidote render the
poison insoluble or nearly so; and insoluble not only in water, but
likewise in the animal fluids, more particularly the juices of the
stomach. The same quality is desirable even in the antidotes for
the pure corrosives; for it often happens that in their soluble combinations
these substances retain some irritating, though not any corrosive
power. When we try by the foregoing criterions many of the
antidotes which have been proposed for various poisons, they will
be found defective; and precise experiments have in recent times
actually proved them to be so.</p>

<p class='c006'>The other kind of antidote operates not by altering the form
of the poison, but by exciting in the system an action contrary to
that established by the poison. On considering attentively, however,
the phenomena of the action of individual poisons, it will be found
exceedingly difficult to say what is the essence of a contrary action,
and still more how that counter-action is to be brought about. Accordingly,
few antidotes of the kind are known. Physiology or experience
has not yet brought to light any mode of inducing an action
counter to that caused by arsenic and most of the irritant class of
poisons. It appears probable that the remote operation of lead may
be sometimes corrected by mercury given to salivation, and that the
violent salivation caused by mercury may be occasionally corrected
by nauseating doses of antimony. But these are the only instances
which occur to me at present of antidotes for irritant poisoning which
operate by counter-action, unless we choose to designate by the name
of antidote the conjunction of remedial means which constitute the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>antiphlogistic method of cure. In the class of narcotics we are acquainted
with equally few constitutional antidotes, although the nature
of the action of these poisons seems better to admit of them. Ammonia
is to a certain extent an antidote for hydrocyanic acid, but by
no means so powerful as some persons believe; and I am not sure
that in this class of poisons we can with any propriety mention another
antidote of the constitutional kind.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the whole, then, it is chiefly among the changes induced by
chemical affinities that the practitioner must look for counter-poisons;
and the ingenuity of the toxicologists has thence supplied the materia
medica with many of singular efficacy. When given in time, magnesia
or chalk is an antidote for the mineral acids and oxalic acid, albumen
for corrosive sublimate and verdigris, bark for tartar-emetic, common
salt for lunar caustic, sulphate of soda or magnesia for sugar of lead
and muriate of baryta, chloride of lime or soda for liver of sulphur,
vinegar or oil for the fixed alkalis; and these substances act either
by neutralizing the corrosive power of the poison, or by forming with
it an insoluble compound.</p>

<p class='c006'>In recent times a new object in the treatment of poisoning has
been pointed out by the discoveries made in its physiology. As it
has been proved that many of the most deadly poisons enter the blood,
and in all probability act by circulating with that fluid, so it has been
inferred that an important object in the treatment is to promote their
discharge by the natural secretions. In support of this reasonable inference
it has been lately rendered probable by Orfila, as will be seen
under the head of the treatment of the effects of arsenic, that it is of
great advantage in some forms of poisoning to increase the discharge
of urine.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the instance of external poisoning the main object of the treatment
is to prevent the poison from entering the blood, or to remove
it from the local vessels which it has entered.</p>

<p class='c006'>One mode, which has been known to the profession from early
times, and after being long in disuse was lately revived by Sir D.
Barry, and applied with success to man, is the application of cupping-glasses to the part where the poison has been introduced.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c013'><sup>[60]</sup></a> This
method may act in various ways. It certainly prevents the farther
absorption of the poison by suspending for a time the absorbing
power of the vessels of the part covered by the cup. It also sucks
the blood out of the wound, and may consequently wash the poison
away with it. Possibly it likewise compresses the nerves around,
and prevents the impression made by the poison on their sentient
extremities from being transmitted along their filaments.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Another mode is by the application of a ligature between the injured
part and the trunk, so as to check the circulation. This is a
very ancient practice in the case of poisoned wounds, and is known
even to savages. But as usually practised it is only a temporary
cure: As soon as the ligature is removed the effects of the poison begin.
It may be employed, however, for many kinds of poisoning through
wounds, so as to effect a radical cure. We have seen that most
poisons of the organic kingdom are in no long time either thrown off
by the system or decomposed in the blood. Hence if the quantity
given has not been too large, recovery will take place. Now, by
means of a ligature, which is removed for a short time at moderately
distant intervals, a poison, which has been introduced into a wound
beyond the reach of extraction, may be gradually admitted into the
system in successive quantities, each too small to cause death or serious
mischief, and be thus in the end entirely removed and destroyed.
Such is a practical application which may be made of some ingenious
experiments performed not long ago by M. Bouillaud with strychnia,
the poisonous principle of nux-vomica.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c013'><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The last mode to be mentioned is by a combination of the ligature
with venesection, deduced by M. Vernière from his experimental researches
formerly noticed (p. <a href='#Page_19'>19</a>). Suppose a fatal dose of extract
of nux-vomica has been thrust into the paw of a dog; M. Vernière
applies a tight ligature round the limb, next injects slowly as much
warm water into the jugular vein as the animal can safely bear, and
then slackens the ligature. The state of venous <i>plethora</i> thus induced
completely suspends absorption. The ligature is next tied so as to
compress the veins without compressing the arteries of the limb, and
a vein is opened between the wound and the ligature in such a situation,
that the blood which flows out must previously pass through, or
at least near the poisoned wound. When a moderate quantity has
been withdrawn, the ligature may be removed with safety; and the
extraction of the poison may be farther proved by the blood that has
been drawn being injected into the veins of another animal; for rapid
death by tetanus will be the result.<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c013'><sup>[62]</sup></a> It is not improbable that in this
plan the preliminary production of venous plethora may be dispensed
with; and then the treatment may be easily and safely applied
to the human subject.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <span class='small'>ON THE EVIDENCE OF GENERAL POISONING.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>This subject is purely medico-legal. It comprehends an account
of the various kinds of evidence by which the medical jurist is
enabled to pronounce whether poisoning in a general sense (that is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>without reference to a particular poison), is impossible, improbable,
possible, probable, or certain. It likewise comprises an appreciation
of the circumstances which usually lead the unprofessional, as
well as the professional, to infer correctly or erroneously a suspicion
of such poisoning.</p>

<p class='c006'>Under the present head might likewise be included the history of
poisoning, the art of secret poisoning, and some other topics of the
like kind. But the want of proper documents, and the unmeasured
credulity which has prevailed on the subject of poisoning throughout
all ages down to very recent times, has entangled these subjects in
so intricate a maze of fable, that a notice of them, sufficiently detailed
to interest the reader, would be quite misplaced in this work.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the art of secret poisoning, however, as having been once an
important object of medical jurisprudence, it might be expected that
some comments should here be offered. But really I do not see any
good reason for wading through the mass of credulous conjectures
and questionable facts, which have been collected on the subject,
and which have been copied into one modern work after another,
for no other cause than that they are of classic origin, or feed our
appetite for the mysterious. No one now seriously believes that
Henry the Sixth was killed by a pair of poisoned gloves, or Pope
Clement the Seventh by a poisoned torch carried before him in a
procession, or Hercules by a poisoned robe, or that the operation of
poisons can be so predetermined as to commence or prove fatal on a
fixed day, and after the lapse of a definite and remote interval.
With regard to the noted instances of secret poisoning, which occurred
towards the close of the seventeenth century in Italy and France,
it is plain to every modern toxicologist, from the only certain knowledge
handed down to us of these events, that the actors in them
owed their success rather to the ignorance of the age, than to their
own dexterity. And as to the refined secrets believed to have been
possessed by them, it is sufficient here to say, that although we are
now acquainted with ten times as many and ten times as subtle poisons
as were known in those days, yet none exist which are endowed
with the hidden qualities once so universally dreaded.</p>

<p class='c006'>The crime of poisoning, from its nature, must always be a secret
one. But little apprehension need be entertained of the art of secret
poisoning as understood by Toffana or Brinvilliers,<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c013'><sup>[63]</sup></a> or as it might be
improved by a modern imitator. It seems to have escaped the attention
of those who have written on the subject, that the practice of
such an art requires the knowledge not only of a dexterous toxicologist,
but also of a skilful physician; for success must depend on the
exact imitation of some natural disease. It is only among medical
men, therefore, and among the higher orders of them, that a Saint-Croix
can arise now-a days. How little is to be dreaded on that
head is apparent from the domestic history of the European kingdoms
for the last half century, compared with their history some centuries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>ago. Few medical men have even been suspected, and those few
only upon visionary grounds, and under the impulse of violent political
feeling.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c013'><sup>[64]</sup></a> In one late instance only, so far as I am aware, has
it been proved that the physician’s art was actually prostituted to so
fearful a purpose; and the detection of the crime in that case shows
how difficult concealment will always be wherever justice is administered
rigorously, and medico-legal investigations skilfully conducted.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c013'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Two extraordinary incidents which happened lately in Germany
may appear at first sight at variance with these views. I allude to
the cases of Anna Margaretha Zwanziger and Margaretha Gottfried,
which justly excited much interest where they occurred, and are
notorious to continental toxicologists. Zwanziger, while serving as
housekeeper in various families in the territory of Bayreuth in
Bavaria during the years 1808 and 1809, contrived to administer
poison,—sometimes under the instigation of mere revenge or spite,
sometimes for the purpose of clearing the way for her schemes of
marriage with her masters,—to no fewer than seventeen individuals
in the course of nine months; and of these three died.<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c013'><sup>[66]</sup></a> Gottfried, a
woman in affluent circumstances and tolerable station in the town of
Bremen, was even more successful. For she pursued her criminal
career undiscovered for fifteen years; and when detected in 1828 had
murdered actually fourteen persons, and administered poison unsuccessfully
to several others. Her motive, as in the case of Zwanziger,
was the mere gratification of a malevolent temper, or the removal of
supposed obstacles to her matrimonial dreams. In neither of these
instances, however, did the criminal possess any particular skill, or
observe much measure in her proceedings. The cases of poisoning
were of the common kind,—produced by arsenic,—proving in general
quickly fatal,—and presenting the ordinary phenomena. I cannot
help thinking, therefore, that the events now alluded to prove
rather the ineffectiveness of the police where they happened, than the
adroitness of the actors by whom they were brought about; and that
they constitute no sound objection to the statement, that the art of
secret poisoning is now unknown, and is not likely to be again
revived.</p>

<p class='c006'>It must be granted, indeed, that the late discoveries in chemistry
and toxicology have made poisons known which might be employed
in such a way as to render suspicion unlikely, and to baffle inquiry.
But the methods now alluded to are hitherto very little known; they
cannot easily be attempted on account of the rarity and difficult preparation
of the poisons; they can never be practised except by a person
conversant with the minute phenomena of natural disease; and it
is no part of the object of this work to make them public.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>The evidence, by which the medical jurist is enabled to pronounce
on the existence or non-existence of poisoning in general, and to
determine the subordinate questions that relate to it, is derived from
five sources,—1, the symptoms during life; 2, the appearances in
the dead body; 3, the chemical analysis; 4, experiments and observations
on animals; and 5, certain moral circumstances, which are
either inseparably interwoven with the medical proof, or cannot be
accurately appreciated without medical knowledge.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section I.</span>—<i>Of the Evidence from Symptoms.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Not many years ago it was the custom to decide questions of
poisoning from the symptoms only. Till the close of last century,
indeed, no other evidence was accounted so infallible: and for the
simple reason, that in reality the other branches of evidence were
even more imperfectly understood. So lately as 1763, and even in
Germany, the solemn opinions of whole colleges were sometimes
grounded almost exclusively on the symptoms.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c013'><sup>[67]</sup></a> About that time,
however, doubts began to be entertained of the infallibility of such
evidence; these doubts have since assumed gradually a more substantial
form; and it is now laid down by every esteemed author in
Medical Jurisprudence, that the symptoms, however exquisitely developed,
can never justify an opinion in favour of more than high probability.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c013'><sup>[68]</sup></a>
In laying down this doctrine medical jurists appear to me to
have injudiciously confounded together actual symptoms with their
general characteristics. If the doctrine is to be held as applying to
the evidence from symptoms, only so far as they are viewed in questions
of general poisoning,—that is, as applying to the general
characters merely of the symptoms,—it is deduced from accurate
principles. But if it is likewise to be applied, as recent authors have
done, to the actual symptoms produced by particular poisons, and in
all cases whatever of their action, then it is a rule clearly liable to
several important exceptions. These exceptions will be noticed
under the heads of the mineral acids, oxalic acid, arsenic, corrosive
sublimate, nux vomica, &amp;c. At present it is only the general characters
of the symptoms, and the points in which they differ from the
general characters of the symptoms of natural disease, that I propose
to consider.</p>

<p class='c006'>The chief characteristics usually ascribed to the symptoms of
poisoning considered generally, are, that they commence suddenly
and prove rapidly fatal,—that they increase steadily,—that they
are uniform in nature throughout their course,—that they begin
soon after a meal,—and that they appear while the body is in a state
of perfect health.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>1. The first characteristic is the <i>suddenness of their appearance and
the rapidity of their progress</i> towards a fatal termination. Some of
them act instantaneously, and the effects of most of them are in general
fully developed within an hour or little more. But this character
is by no means uniform. The most violent may be made to act, so
as to bring on their peculiar symptoms slowly, or even by imperceptible
degrees. Thus arsenic, which usually causes violent symptoms
from the very beginning, may be so administered as to occasion at
first nothing more than slight nausea and general feebleness; and
afterwards in slow succession its more customary effects. In like
manner corrosive sublimate may be given in such a way as to cause
at first mild salivation, and finally gangrene of the mouth. Even
many vegetable poisons might be administered in the same way. The
well-known consequences of digitalis in medicinal doses will serve as
a familiar instance. A still better illustration is supplied by the medicinal
effects of the alkaloid of nux-vomica, whose action in other
circumstances is most rapid and violent: Strychnia in a moderate
dose will cause death by violent tetanus in two or three minutes;
but when given in frequent small doses as a remedy in palsy, it has
been known to bring on first starting of the limbs, then stiffness of
the jaw, afterwards pain and rigidity of the neck; and these effects
might be increased so gradually, that the patient would seem to die
under ordinary tetanus. Nevertheless, the foregoing considerations
being kept always in mind, it still remains true, that the effects of
poisons for the most part begin suddenly, when the dose is large.
This is an important circumstance in regard to certain active poisons,
such as the mineral acids, oxalic acid, arsenic, strychnia, &amp;c. For
when it is considered that in criminal cases they are given for the
most part in unnecessarily large doses, it follows that if the effect
ascribed to these poisons in such doses have not begun suddenly, the
suspicion is probably incorrect.</p>

<p class='c006'>The same remarks may be applied to the sudden termination of
the symptoms. Poison is for the most part given criminally in doses
so large that it proves rapidly fatal. Yet this is not always the case;
the diseased state occasioned by poisons has often been prolonged,
as will be seen hereafter, for several weeks, sometimes for several
months; nay, a person may be carried off by a malady, the seeds of
which have been sown by the operation of poison years before.</p>

<p class='c006'>The present would be the proper place for noticing the important
question regarding the interval of time, after which, if death supervenes,
it cannot be laid to the charge of the person who administered
the poison. It is unnecessary, however, to say much on the subject.
According to the English law, death must take place within a year.
As to the Scottish law, it may be inferred from what has been said
by the late Baron Hume on the subject of homicide generally, that a
charge of poisoning is relevant although the person should die at a
period indefinitely remote, and that it will infer the pains of law,
provided the operation of the poison can be distinctly traced, unmodified
by extraneous circumstances, from the commencement of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>symptoms to the fatal termination.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c013'><sup>[69]</sup></a> Of course the influence of these
modifying circumstances in lessening the criminal’s responsibility
will increase with the interval. The question for the medical jurist
to determine in such a case would therefore be, the distance of time
to which death may be delayed in the case of poisoning generally,
and in that of the particular poison. This question cannot be answered
even with an approach to precision, except in the instance of
a few common poisons. Most vegetable and animal poisons prove
fatal either in a few days or not at all; but some mineral poisons may
cause death after an interval of many days. It appears probable that
arsenic may cause death after an interval of several months, and it is
well ascertained that the symptoms of poisoning with the mineral
acids have continued uninterruptedly and without modification for
eight months, and then terminated fatally.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The next general characteristic of the symptoms of poisoning is
<i>regularity in their increase</i>. It is clear, however, that even this character
cannot be universal. For in all cases of slow poisoning by
repeated small doses there must be remissions and exacerbations, just
as in natural diseases. Besides, as we can seldom watch the symptoms
advancing in their simple form, but must endeavour to remove
them by remedies, remissions may thus be produced and their tendency
to increase steadily counteracted. Farther, some poisons admit
of exacerbations and remissions, even when given in one large
dose; and there are others, the very essence of whose action is to
produce violent symptoms in frequent paroxysms. Of the latter kind
are nux vomica, and the other substances that contain strychnia. Of
the former kind is arsenic: in cases of poisoning with arsenic it often
happens, that after the first five or six hours have been passed in
great agony, the symptoms undergo a striking remission for as many
hours, and then return with equal or increased violence. Still it is
true that on the whole the symptoms of poisoning are steady in their
progress; so that this should always be attended to as one of the general
characters. In the case of slow poisoning, too, when the most
remarkable deviations from it are observed, the very occurrence of
exacerbations and remissions, combined with certain points of moral
proof, may furnish the strongest evidence possible. Thus, on the
trial of Miss Blandy at Oxford in 1752, for the murder of her father,
one of the strongest circumstances in proof was, that repeatedly after
she gave the deceased a bowl of gruel, suspected to be poisoned, his
illness was much increased in violence.<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c013'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>As connected with the present subject, a question might here be
noticed that has been discussed on the occasion of various trials,
namely, whether the symptoms of poisoning are susceptible of a complete
intermission. It cannot be answered satisfactorily, however,
except with reference to particular poisons. The property alluded
to has been ascribed to several poisons, even to mercury, arsenic, and
opium; but oftener, I believe, in consequence of an improper desire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>on the part of the witness to prove or to perfect their view of the case,
than through legitimate induction from facts.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Another characteristic is <i>uniformity in the nature of the symptoms</i>
throughout their whole progress. This character is the least
invariable of them all; for many poisons cause very different symptoms
towards the close from those which they cause at the beginning.
Arsenic may induce at first inflammation of the alimentary canal, and
afterwards palsy or epilepsy; nux-vomica may excite at first violent
tetanus, and afterwards inflammation of the stomach and bowels; and
corrosive sublimate, after exciting in the first instance inflammation,
may prove eventually fatal by inducing excessive ptyalism. In truth,
certain changes of this kind in the nature of the symptoms will, in
special cases, afford strong presumption, perhaps absolute proof, not
only of general poisoning, but even also of the particular poison
given. The reason for mentioning so uncertain a character as uniformity
in the nature of the symptoms among their characteristics will
appear presently.—[pp. <a href='#Page_47'>47</a> &amp; <a href='#Page_50'>50</a>.]</p>

<p class='c006'>4. The fourth characteristic is, that <i>the symptoms begin soon after
a meal</i>, or rather, soon after food, drink, or medicine has been taken.
The occasions on which we eat and drink are so numerous and so
near one another, that unless the poison suspected is one which
acts with rapidity, it may be difficult to attach any weight to
this circumstance. Some poisons rarely produce their effects till a
considerable time after they are swallowed; the poisonous mushrooms,
for example, may remain in the alimentary canal for several
hours or even an entire day and more, before their effects begin; poisonous
cheese in like manner may not act for five or six hours,<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c013'><sup>[71]</sup></a> or
even a whole day;<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c013'><sup>[72]</sup></a> and that kind of cholera, which is caused in
some people by putrid, diseased, and new-killed meat, seldom begins,
so far as I have observed, till twelve hours or more after the noxious
meal. With regard to the commoner poisons, such as arsenic, corrosive
sublimate, the mineral acids, oxalic acid, nux-vomica, and
the like, it is a good general rule, that the symptoms, if violent from
the beginning, must have begun soon after food, drink, or medicine
has been taken.</p>

<p class='c006'>In making inquiries respecting this point, however, care must be
taken not to lose sight of certain circumstances which may cause a
deviation from the general rule.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first place, it should be remembered that poisons may be
administered in many other ways besides mixing them with articles
of food or drink, or substituting them for medicines. They may be
introduced into the anus; they have been introduced into the vagina;
they have also been introduced by inhalation in the form of vapour;
and there can be no difficulty in introducing some of them through
wounds.</p>

<p class='c006'>Secondly, another circumstance which may be kept in view is,
that, if a person falls asleep very soon after swallowing a poison, especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>one of the irritants, the commencement of the symptoms may
be considerably retarded, provided it be not one of the powerful corrosives.
This statement is not so fully supported by facts as to admit
of its being laid down with confidence as a general rule. But
from various incidents which have come under my notice it appears
not improbable, that sleep does possess the power of putting off for a
while the action of some poisons. In particular some instances have
occurred to me where arsenic taken at night did not begin to act for
several hours, the individual having in the meantime been asleep.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c013'><sup>[73]</sup></a>
The occurrence of so long an interval between its administration and
the first appearance of the symptoms is so contrary to what generally
happens, that some cause or another must be in activity; and the insensibility
of the system during sleep to most sources of excitement
seems to supply a sufficient explanation. The slow operation of laxatives
during sleep compared with their effects during one’s waking
hours, is an analogical fact.</p>

<p class='c006'>A third consideration to be attended to is, that poison may be secretly
administered during sleep to a person who lies habitually with
his mouth open. This is fully proved by an interesting case which
will be noticed under the head of the moral evidence of poisoning.
In that particular case the individual immediately awoke, because the
poison was concentrated sulphuric acid; but it may admit of question
whether a sound sleeper might not swallow less irritating poisons
without being awakened. In such circumstances no connexion of
course could be traced between the taking of a suspected article and
the first appearance of the symptoms.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Lastly, <i>the symptoms appear during a state of perfect health</i>. This
is an important character, yet not universal; for it cannot be expected
to apply to cases of slow poisoning, and poisons may be given while
the person is actually labouring under natural disease. Cases of the
last description are generally very embarrassing; for if, instead of
medicine, a poison be administered, whose symptoms resemble
the natural disease, suspicion may not arise till it is too late to collect
evidence.</p>

<p class='c006'>It must be apparent from the preceding observations, that the
characters common to the symptoms of general poisoning are by no
means universally applicable. Yet on reviewing them attentively it
will also appear, that, considering the little knowledge possessed by
the vulgar of the action of poisons, and consequently the rude nature
of their attempts to commit murder by poisoning, the exceptions to
the general statements made above will not be numerous.</p>

<p class='c006'>It now remains to be seen how far these characters distinguish the
symptoms of poisoning from those of natural disease; and</p>

<p class='c006'>1. As to the <i>suddenness of their invasion and rapidity of their progress</i>,
it is almost needless to observe, that many natural diseases
commence with a suddenness and prove fatal with a rapidity, which
few or no poisons can surpass. The plague may prove instantaneously
fatal; and even the continued fever of this country may be fully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>formed in an hour, and may terminate fatally, as I have once witnessed,
at the beginning of the second day. Inflammation of the
stomach also begins suddenly and terminates soon. Cholera likewise
answers this description: I have known the characters of ordinary
cholera fully developed within an hour after the first warning symptom,
and frequently in hot climates, nay, in some rare instances even
in Britain, it proves fatal in a few hours. Malignant cholera frequently
proves fatal in a few hours. Inflammation of the intestines,
too, may begin, or at least seem to begin, suddenly and end fatally
in a day: One variety of it, now well known to affect the mucous
membrane, may remain quite latent till the gut is perforated by ulceration,
and then the patient is attacked with acute pain, vomiting,
and mortal faintness, and frequently perishes within twenty-four
hours.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c013'><sup>[74]</sup></a> But in particular many organic diseases of the heart prove
suddenly fatal, without any previous warning; and this is also true
to a certain extent even of apoplexy; for, as will afterwards be seen,
it is an error to suppose that apoplexy is always, or even generally,
preceded by warning symptoms. The first characteristic, therefore,
as applied to the symptoms of poisoning generally, contrasted with
those of general disease, must appear by no means distinctive. But
opportunities will occur afterwards for showing, that it is sometimes
a good diagnostic in the case of particular poisons.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c013'><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>2. As to the uniformity or <i>uninterrupted increase of the symptoms</i>,
it is equally the attribute of many common diseases. I am not aware,
that in speedily fatal cases of the internal <i>phlegmasiæ</i> a considerable
remission is often observed. Apoplexy, too, very frequently continues
its course without interruption; and the same may be said of
cholera, and indeed of most acute diseases, when they prove rapidly
fatal.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. It was stated above, that the third character, <i>uniformity in kind</i>
throughout their progress, is by no means an invariable circumstance.
Still less is it distinctive; for many diseases are marked by great uniformity
of symptoms. It has been enumerated nevertheless among
the general characters of poisoning, because, although its presence
can hardly ever add any weight to the evidence in favour of death
by poison, its absence may sometimes afford even positive proof in
favour of natural death. That is, changes of a certain kind occurring
in the symptoms during their progress may be incompatible with the
known effects of a particular poison or of all poisons, and capable
of being accounted for only on the supposition of natural disease
having been at least the ultimate cause of death. This statement,
which is one of some importance, is illustrated by a pointed case,
that of Charles Munn, mentioned at the close of the present section.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. In the next place, it was observed that some reliance may be
placed on the fact, that the symptoms of poisoning <i>appear very soon
after a meal</i>. But we also know this to be the most frequent occasion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>on which some natural disorders begin. An attack of apoplexy
after a hearty meal is a common occurrence. That kind of cholera
which follows the immoderate use of acid fruit likewise comes on
soon after eating. Sometimes mere excessive distension of the
stomach after a meal proves suddenly or instantaneously fatal.
Drinking cold water when the body is over-heated likewise causes at
times immediate death. It appears that perforation of the stomach,
the result of an insidious ulcer of its coats, and likewise rupture of the
stomach from mechanical causes, are most apt to occur during the
digestion, and therefore soon after the taking of a meal.</p>

<p class='c006'>These few observations will make it evident that the appearing of
violent symptoms soon after eating may arise from other causes
besides the administration of poison. At the same time, as the
diseases which are apt to commence suddenly at that particular time
are few in number, and none of them by any means frequent, it is
always justly reckoned a very suspicious circumstance; and when
combined with certain points of moral proof, such as that several
people, who have eaten together, were seized about the same time
with the same kind of symptoms, the evidence of general poisoning
becomes very strong indeed. Sometimes the evidence from the date
of their commencement after a meal may singly supply strong evidence,
as in the case of the mineral acids and alkalis, or corrosive
sublimate, which begin to act in a few seconds or minutes.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the other hand, if the symptoms do not begin soon after food,
drink, or medicine has been taken (the circumstances being such as
to exclude the possibility of poison being introduced by a wound, by
the lungs, or by any other channel but the stomach), the presumption
on the whole is against poisoning; and sometimes the evidence to
this effect may be decisive. The principle now propounded may be
often a very important one in the practice of medical jurisprudence;
for when united with a little knowledge of the symptoms antecedent
to death, it may be sufficient to decide the nature of the case. Thus
it is sufficient, in my opinion, to decide the celebrated case of the
Crown Prince of Sweden. The prince, while in the act of reviewing
a body of troops on the 28th May, 1810, was observed suddenly to
waver on his horse; and soon afterwards he fell off while at the
gallop, was immediately found insensible by his staff, and expired
in half an hour. As he was much beloved by the whole nation, a
rumour arose that he had been poisoned; and the report took such
firm root in the minds of all ranks, that a party of military, while
escorting the body to Stockholm, were attacked near the city by the
populace, and their commander, Marshal Fersen, murdered; and
Dr. Rossi, the prince’s physician, after narrowly escaping the same
fate, was in the end obliged to quit his native country. Now, no
other poison but one of the most active narcotics could have caused
such symptoms, and none of them could have proved so quickly fatal
unless given in a large dose. It was proved, however, that on the
day of his death the prince had not taken any thing after he breakfasted;
and an interval of nearly four hours elapsed after that till he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>fell from his horse. This fact alone, independently of the marks of
apoplexy found in the head after death, and the warning symptoms
he repeatedly had, was quite enough to show that he could not have
died of poison, as it was incompatible with the known action of the
only poisons which could cause the symptoms. This is very properly
one of the arguments used by the Medical Faculty of Stockholm,
which was consulted on the occasion.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c013'><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The same circumstances will often enable us to decide at once a
set of cases of frequent occurrence, particularly in towns,—where
the sudden death of a person in a family, the members of which are
on bad terms with one another, is rashly and ignorantly imputed to
poison, without any particular poison being pointed at; and where,
consequently, unless the morbid appearances clearly indicate the
cause of death, a very troublesome analysis might be necessary. In
several cases of this kind, which have been submitted to me, I have
been induced to dispense with an analysis by resting on the criterion
now under consideration. The following is a good example.</p>

<p class='c006'>A middle-aged man, who had long enjoyed excellent health, one
afternoon about two o’clock returned home tired, and after having
been severely beaten by his wife went to bed. At a quarter past two
one of his workmen found him gasping, rolling his eyes, and quite
insensible; and he died in a few minutes. As his wife had often
maltreated and threatened him, a suspicion arose that he had died of
poison, and the body was in consequence examined judiciously by
Sir W. Newbigging and myself. The only appearance of disease we
could detect was a considerable tuberculation of the septum cordis
and anterior parietes of both ventricles. This disease might have
been the cause of death; for there is no disease of the heart which
may not remain long latent, and prove fatal suddenly. But, as the
man never had a symptom referrible to disease of the heart, it was
impossible to infer, in face of a suspicion of poisoning, that it must
have been the cause of death; since the man might very well have
died of poison, the disease of the heart continuing latent. Poisoning,
however, was out of the question. The man had taken nothing
whatever after breakfasting about nine. Now no poison but one of
the most active narcotics in a large dose could cause death so rapidly
as in this case; and the operation of such a poison in such a dose
could not be suspended so long as from nine till two. An analysis
was therefore unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Little need be said with regard to <i>the symptoms beginning,
while the body is in a state of perfect health</i>; because in truth almost
all acute diseases begin under the same circumstances. Connected
with this subject, however, a point of difference should be noticed
which may be of use for distinguishing poisoning by the irritants
from acute diseases of the inflammatory kind:—the latter rarely
begin without some adequate and obvious natural cause.</p>

<p class='c006'>On considering all that has now been said regarding the characteristics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>of the symptoms of general poisoning, as contrasted with
those of natural disease, no one can hesitate to allow, that from
them alone a medical jurist can never be entitled to pronounce
that poisoning is certain. At the same time he must not on that
account neglect them. For, in the first place, they are of great
value as generally giving him the first hints of the cause of mischief,
and so leading him to search in time for better evidence.
Next, they will often enable him to say that poisoning was possible,
probable, or highly probable; which, when the moral evidence
is very strong, may be quite enough to decide the case. Thirdly,
although they can never entitle him to say that poisoning was certain,
they will sometimes enable him to say, on the contrary, that it
was impossible. And to conclude, when the chemical or moral
evidence proves that poison was given, the characters of the symptoms
may be necessary to determine whether it was the cause of
death.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the last statement is one of consequence, and yet has been
overlooked by some authors on medical jurisprudence in this country,
it may be illustrated by one or two comments. It does not follow,
because a poison has been given, that it is the cause of death;
and therefore in every medico-legal inquiry the cause of the first
symptoms and the cause of death should be made two distinct questions.
The question, whether a poison, proved to have been administered,
was the cause of death, is to be answered by attending
to the second and third characteristics mentioned above, and considering
whether the symptoms went on progressively increasing, or
altered their nature during the course of the patient’s illness, and
whether the alteration, if any, was such as may occur in the case
of poisoning generally, or of the special poison given. These remarks
are very well exemplified by a case, of which I have related
the particulars elsewhere,<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c013'><sup>[77]</sup></a> that, namely, of Charles Munn,
tried at the Inverary Spring Circuit of 1824 for the double crime
of procuring abortion, and of murder by poisoning. The moral
evidence and symptoms together left no doubt that arsenic had
been given, and that the deceased, a girl with whom the prisoner
cohabited, laboured under the effects of that poison in a very aggravated
and complex form for twelve days. After that she began to
recover rapidly, and in the course of a fortnight more was free of
every symptom except weakness and pains in the hands and feet:
In short, all things considered, she was thought to be out of danger.
But she then became affected with headache and sleeplessness,
and died in nineteen days more under symptoms of obscure
general fever, without any local inflammation. Dr. Duncan, junior,
and I, who were consulted by the Crown in this case, were of opinion,—that
granting the girl’s first illness, as appeared from moral
and medical evidence, was owing to arsenic, her death could not
be ascribed to it with any certainty. It is true that in a few instances
the primary irritant symptoms caused by arsenic have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>known to pass into an obscure general fever, which has ended
fatally; and that this mode of termination coincides with the effects
ascribed to arsenic as the chief ingredient in the celebrated <i>Aqua
Toffana</i>. But the latter phenomena, at best of doubtful authenticity,
are not represented to have been preceded by the ordinary
symptoms of violent irritation, or to have been developed except
under the use of continuous small doses; and as for the more
recent and less ambiguous cases of fever succeeding the usual primary
effects of a large dose, in no instance yet recorded was there
an intermission between the two stages.</p>

<p class='c006'>So much, then, for the force of the evidence drawn from the characters
of the symptoms of general poisoning. According to the
example of others, I might consider in the present place the force
of evidence derived from the symptoms themselves, which distinguish
the three classes of poisons. But this subject, together with
the special natural diseases which imitate the symptoms of poisoning,
will be treated of more conveniently as an introduction to each
of the classes.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section II.</span>—<i>Of the Evidence from Morbid Appearances.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The appearances left in the dead body after death by poison
used formerly to be relied on as strongly as the symptoms during
life; and with even less reason. Except in the instance of a very
few poisons, the morbid appearances alone can never distinguish
death by poison from the effects of natural disease, or from some
other kinds of violent death. There is not much room, therefore,
for general remarks under the present head.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was at one time thought by the profession, and is still very generally
imagined by the vulgar, that unusual blackness or lividity of the
skin, indicates death by poison generally. But every experienced physician
is now well aware, that excessive lividity is by no means universally
produced by poison, and that it is likewise produced by
so many natural diseases as not even to form, in any circumstances
whatever, the slightest ground of suspicion. Neither is there any
difference in kind, as some imagine, between the lividity which
succeeds death by poison, and that which follows natural death.
Yet it is right for the medical jurist to be aware that lividity as
a supposed consequence of poison ought to be strictly attended to
by medical inspectors and law officers while investigating charges
of poisoning, because the vulgar belief on the subject sometimes
leads to such conduct or language on the part of the poisoner as
betrays his secret at the time, and constitutes evidence of his guilt
afterwards.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another appearance equally unimportant is early putrefaction of
the body. Early putrefaction, at one time much insisted on as a
criterion of poisoning,<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c013'><sup>[78]</sup></a> cannot even justify suspicion. It is by no
means invariably, or even generally caused by poisons; nay, sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>a state precisely the reverse appears to be induced;<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c013'><sup>[79]</sup></a> and it
is seen quite as frequently after natural death.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some other appearances, not more conclusive, might also be mentioned
here; but they belong properly to the effects of individual
poisons, or of classes of poisons, not to those of poisoning generally.
It may merely be remarked at present, therefore, that the appearances
after death, which are really morbid, and which may be
produced by poisons, are, in one great class, the signs of inflammation
of the alimentary canal in its progressive stages,—in another
class, the signs of congestion within the head,—and in a third, a
combination of the effects of the two preceding classes; that neither
set of appearances is invariably caused by the poisons which
usually cause them; that congestion within the head is really seldom
produced by those which are currently imagined to produce it;
and that most of the appearances of both kinds are exactly similar
to those left by many natural diseases.</p>

<p class='c006'>But although, on the whole, the appearances after death, when
considered singly, can seldom supply evidence of poisoning even
to the amount of probability, they may nevertheless prove very important
under other points of view. Thus, in connection with the
symptoms and the general evidence, the appearances after death
may furnish decisive proof; and even should the history of the
symptoms be unknown, or have been unskilfully collected, the appearances
after death, by pointing out the nature of the previous illness,
may furnish evidence enough to decide the case, when the
moral proof is strong. Again, in cases of alleged <i>imputation of
poisoning</i> they are necessary to determine whether a poison actually
found in the body was introduced during life or after death. Besides,
the very absence of morbid appearances may afford presumptive
proof in some circumstances,—when, for example, the question
is, whether a person has died of apoplexy or of poisoning
with narcotics? Farther, a few poisons, as was formerly stated, occasionally
produce appearances so characteristic, as not to be capable
of being confounded with the effects of any other agent whatsoever:
It will be found hereafter, for example, that the mineral
acids have at times left behind them in the dead body unequivocal
evidence of their operation. And finally, in cases where no
doubt can be entertained that poison was taken, the evidence from
morbid appearances may be useful or necessary for settling whether
or not it was the cause of death. Two pointed examples of this
kind will be noticed under the next section.</p>

<p class='c006'>When signs of the action of poison are not found in the dead body,
and on the contrary marks are found of the operation of natural disease,
the presumption of course is that the person died a natural
death. But here a few words of caution must be added with regard
to the drawing of that inference in cases where the history of the
symptoms is not known. It does not follow merely because certain
appearances of natural disease are found, that their cause was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>cause of death. For death may have arisen from a totally different
cause, such as poisoning. This remark is not, as some may imagine,
the offspring of hypothetical refinement, but a necessary caution,
drawn from actual and not unfrequent occurrences. Thus, for example,
the following cases will show, that there may be found in the
dead body diseased appearances, arising from pleurisy, hydrothorax,
or peripneumony, sufficient to cause death, or to account for death in
ordinary circumstances; and that nevertheless the disease may have
been completely latent, and death have arisen from poison. In
Rust’s Magazin is related the case of a German apothecary, who
poisoned himself with prussic acid, and in whose body the lower
lobe of the left lung was found consolidated and partly cartilaginous.<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c013'><sup>[80]</sup></a>
In Corvisart’s Journal an army-surgeon has described the case of a
soldier, who died of a few hours’ illness, and whose right lung was
found after death forming one entire abscess; yet to the very last
day of his existence he daily underwent all the fatigues of a military
life; and in fact he died of poisoning with hemlock.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c013'><sup>[81]</sup></a> In Pyl’s
Memoirs and Observations, there is a similar account of a woman
who enjoyed tolerable health, and died during a fit of excessive
drinking, and in whose body the whole left lung was found one mass
of suppuration.<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c013'><sup>[82]</sup></a> Under the next section will be mentioned other
equally pointed cases of death by poison, where the apparent cause
of death was external violence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The conclusions to be drawn from these facts are that, at all events,
the medical inspector in a question of poisoning, must take care not
to be hurried away by the first striking appearances of natural disease
which he may observe, and so be induced to conduct the rest
of the inspection superficially; and likewise, that he should not so
frame his opinion on the case, as to exclude the possibility of a different
cause from the apparent one, unless the appearances are such
as must necessarily have been the cause of death. It may be said,
that in requiring this condition for an unqualified opinion, a rigour of
demonstration is exacted, which can rarely be attained in practice.
But, on the one hand, it must not be forgotten, that an unqualified
opinion is not always necessary; and on the other hand, although it
were, I think it might be shown, if the subject did not lead to disproportionate
details, that we may often approach very near the
rigour of demonstration required. At present no more need be said,
than that the inspector should be particularly on his guard in those
cases, in which the appearances, though belonging to the effects of
a deadly disease, are trifling; and still more in those in which the
appearances, though great, belong to the effects of a disease, whose
whole course may be latent. And I may add, that, from what I
have observed of medico-legal opinions, the caution now given is
strongly called for.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be right to allude here also to another purpose which may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>be served by a careful consideration of the morbid appearances. In
cases in which the history of the symptoms is unknown or imperfect
the extent and state of progress of the appearances will sometimes
supply strong presumptive evidence of the duration of the poisoning.
This is an obvious and important application of the knowledge of
the pathology of poisoning; but the simple mention of it is all which
can be here attempted, as special rules can hardly be laid down on
the subject.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section III.</span>—<i>Evidence from Chemical Analysis.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The chemical evidence in charges of poisoning is generally, and
with justice, considered the most decisive of all the branches of proof.
It is accounted most valid, when it detects the poison in the general
textures of the body, or in the blood, or in the stomach, intestines or
gullet, then in the matter vomited, next in articles of food, drink or
medicine of which the sufferer has partaken, and lastly, in any articles
found in the prisoner’s possession, and for which he cannot account
satisfactorily.</p>

<p class='c006'>When poison is detected in any of these quarters, more especially
in the stomach or intestines, it is seldom that any farther proof is
needed to establish the fact of poisoning. In two circumstances,
however, some corroboration is necessary.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first place, in cases where a defence is attempted by a
charge of imputation of poisoning it may be necessary to determine
by an accurate account of the symptoms, or by the morbid appearances,
or by both together, whether the poison was introduced into
the body before or after death. For it is said, that attempts have
been made to impute crime by introducing poison into the stomach
or anus of a dead body; and although I have not been able to find
any authentic instance of so horrible an act of ingenuity having been
perpetrated, it must nevertheless be allowed to be quite possible.</p>

<p class='c006'>Secondly, an account of the symptoms and morbid appearances is
still more necessary, when the question at issue is, not so much whether
poison has been given, as whether it was the cause of death,
granting it had been taken. Some remarks have been already made
on this question in the two former sections. In the present place
some farther illustrations will be added from two very striking cases.
They are interesting in many respects, and particularly as showing
the importance of strict medico-legal investigation: I am almost certain
that but a few years ago their real nature would not have been
discovered in this country. The first to be noticed occurred to Dr.
Wildberg of Rostock. Wildberg was required to examine the body
of a girl, who died while her father was in the act of chastising her
severely for stealing, and who was believed by all the bye-standers,
and by the father himself, to have died of the beating. Accordingly,
Wildberg found the marks of many stripes on the arms, shoulders
and back, and under some of the marks blood was extravasated in
considerable quantity. But these injuries, though severe, did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>appear to him adequate to account for death. He therefore proceeded
to examine the cavities; and on opening the stomach, he found it
very much inflamed, and lined with a white powder which proved
on analysis to be arsenic. It turned out, that on the theft being detected
the girl had taken arsenic for fear of her father’s anger, that
she vomited during the flogging, and died in slight convulsions.
Consequently, Wildberg very properly imputed death to the arsenic.
In this case the chemical evidence proved that poison had been
taken; but an account of the symptoms and appearances was necessary
to prove that she died of it.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c013'><sup>[83]</sup></a> The other case occurred to Pyl
in 1783. A woman at Berlin, who lived on bad terms with her
husband, went to bed in perfect health; but soon afterwards her
mother found her breathing very hard, and on inquiring into the
cause discovered a wound in the left side of the breast. A surgeon
being immediately sent for, the hemorrhage which had never been
great, was checked without difficulty; but she died nevertheless towards
morning. On opening the chest it appeared that the wound
pierced into it, and penetrated the pericardium, but did not wound
the heart; and although the fifth intercostal artery had been divided,
hardly any blood was effused into the cavity of the chest. Coupling
these circumstances with the trifling hemorrhage during life, and the
fact that she had much vomiting, and some convulsions immediately
before death, Pyl satisfied himself that she had not died of the
wound: and accordingly the signs of corrosion in the mouth and
throat, and of irritation in the stomach, with the subsequent discovery
of the remains of some nitric acid in a glass in her room, proved that
she had died of poison.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c013'><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Causes of the disappearance of poison from the body.</i>—Chemical
evidence is not always attainable in cases of poisoning. Various
causes may remove the poison beyond reach. Hence although poison
be not detected in the body,—the experimenter being supposed
skilful and the poison of a kind which is easily discovered,—still it
must not be concluded from that fact alone that poison has not been
the cause of death. For that which was taken into the stomach may
have been all discharged by vomiting and purging, or may have been
all absorbed, or decomposed; and that which has been absorbed
into the system may have been all discharged by the excretions.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. It may have been discharged by vomiting and purging. Thus
on the trial of George Thom for poisoning the Mitchells, held at
Aberdeen at the Autumn Circuit of 1821, it was clearly proved, that
the deceased had died of poisoning by arsenic; yet by a careful
analysis none could be detected in the stomach or its contents; for
the man lived seven days, and during all that time laboured under
frequent vomiting.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c013'><sup>[85]</sup></a> In a remarkable case related by Dr. Roget,
arsenic could not be found in the matter vomited twenty-four hours
after it had been swallowed;<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c013'><sup>[86]</sup></a> in another related by Professor Wagner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>of Berlin, that of an infant who died in twelve hours under incessant
vomiting after receiving a small quantity of arsenic, none could be
detected in the stomach;<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c013'><sup>[87]</sup></a> in another which I have described in a
paper on arsenic, although the person lived only five hours, the
whole arsenic which could be detected in the tissues and contents of
the stomach did not exceed a fifteenth part of a grain;<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c013'><sup>[88]</sup></a> in an American
Journal there is a striking case of a grocer, who died eight
hours after swallowing an ounce of arsenic, and in whose body none
could be found chemically,—at a period however antecedent to the
late improvements in analysis;<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c013'><sup>[89]</sup></a> and in a case communicated to me
not long ago by Mr. Hewson of Lincoln, where arsenic was given in
solution, and death ensued in five hours, none of the poison could
be detected either in the contents or tissues of the stomach by a
careful analysis conducted according to the most modern principles.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nevertheless, it is singular how ineffectual vomiting proves in expelling
some poisons from the stomach. Those which are not easily
soluble, and have been taken in a state of minute division, may remain
adhering to the villous coat, notwithstanding repeated and violent
efforts to dislodge them by vomiting. Many instances to this
effect have occurred in the instance of arsenic. Metzger has related
a case, where, after six hours of incessant vomiting, three drachms
were found in the stomach.<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c013'><sup>[90]</sup></a> Mr. Sidey, a surgeon of this city, has
mentioned to me an instance of poisoning with king’s yellow, in
which he found the stomach lined with the poison, although the patient
had vomited for thirty hours. In three cases which I have investigated
arsenic was detected, although the people lived and vomited
much for nearly two days;<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c013'><sup>[91]</sup></a> and Professor Orfila has noticed
a similar instance in which that poison was found in the contents of
the stomach, although the person had vomited incessantly for two entire
days.<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c013'><sup>[92]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It is not easy to specify the period after which a poison that has
excited vomiting need not be looked for in the stomach. It must
vary with a variety of circumstances whose combined effect it is almost
impossible to appreciate, such as the solubility and state of division
of the poison, the frequency of vomiting, the substances taken
as remedies, and the like. When the poison is in solution and the
patient vomits much, an analysis may be expected to prove frequently
abortive, even though the individual survives but a few hours, as in
Mr. Hewson’s case already noticed. In other circumstances, however,
as various facts quoted above will show, poisons may frequently
be found after two days incessant vomiting; and on the whole it may
be stated, that the recent improvements in analysis render the period
much longer than it has generally been, and would naturally be
imagined. Metzger has related the case of a woman poisoned with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>arsenic mixed with currants, in whose body, after eight days of frequent
vomiting, he found ten or twelve currants, which gave out an
odour of garlic when burnt;<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c013'><sup>[93]</sup></a> but here the dose, if there was really
arsenic, must have been repeated recently before death, for it is not
possible to conceive how currants could remain in the stomach so
long, whatever may be thought of the possibility of arsenic remaining.
It is farther proper to add, that Professor Henke of Erlangen,
one of the highest living authorities in Germany, once found grains
of arsenic in the gullet, although he found none in any other part
of the body, of a person who survived the taking of the poison four
days.<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c013'><sup>[94]</sup></a> Allowing to this fact all the weight derived from the high
name of its author, I must nevertheless express great doubt whether
the arsenic was not repeated more recently before death.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The poison may have disappeared, because it has been all absorbed.
It has several times happened that in the bodies of those
poisoned with laudanum, or even with solid opium, none of the drug
could be detected after death. Sometimes indeed it is found, even
though the individual survived the taking of the poison many hours.
Thus a case related by Meyer of Berlin, in which the person lived
ten hours after taking the saffron-tincture of opium; and nevertheless
it was detected in the stomach by a mixed smell of saffron and
opium.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c013'><sup>[95]</sup></a> But more commonly it all disappears, unless the dose has
been very large. In a case of poisoning with laudanum, which I
examined here along with Sir W. Newbigging in 1823, none could
be detected, although strong moral circumstances left no doubt that
laudanum had been swallowed seven or eight hours before death.
An instance of the same kind has been minutely related by Pyl. It
was that of an infant who was poisoned with a mixture of opium and
hyoscyamus, and in whose stomach and intestines none could be detected
by the smell.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c013'><sup>[96]</sup></a> Similar observations have been often made on
animals; and several additional cases of the same purport, occurring
in man, will be related under the head of opium.</p>

<p class='c006'>It might be of use to quote some of the numerous errors committed
by medical witnesses, in consequence of having overlooked the effect
of absorption in removing poisons beyond the reach of chemical
analysis. But not to be too prolix, I shall be content with mentioning
a single very distinct case in point, which happened at a Coroner’s
Inquest in London, in 1823. A young man one evening called
his fellow-lodger to his bedside; assured him he had taken laudanum,
and should be dead by the morrow; and desired him to carry
his last farewell to his mother and his mistress. His companion
thought he was shamming; but next morning the unfortunate youth
was found in the agonies of death. The moral evidence was not
very satisfactory; but that is of little consequence to my present object.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>The point in the case I would particularly refer to is the declaration
of the medical inspector, that laudanum could not have
been taken, because he did not find any by the smell or by chemical
analysis in the contents of the stomach.<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c013'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>3. Poisons may not be found, because the excess has been decomposed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Vegetable and animal poisons may be altogether destroyed by the
process of digestion. This observation will explain why sometimes
no poison could be found in cases of poisoning with crude opium or
other vegetable solids. A French physician, M. Desruelles, has related
the case of a soldier, who died six hours and a half after swallowing
two drachms of solid opium, and in whose stomach nothing was
found but a yellowish fluid, quite destitute of the smell of the drug.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c013'><sup>[98]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Some mineral poisons, such as corrosive sublimate, lunar caustic,
and hydrochlorate of tin, are also decomposed in the stomach. But
they are not removed beyond the reach of chemical analysis. The
decomposition is the result of a chemical, not of a vital process;
and the basis of the poison may be found in the solid contents of the
stomach under some other compound form. Other poisons again may
be apt to elude detection by altering their form, by combining with
other substances, without themselves undergoing decomposition.
Thus it appears from a case related by Mertzdorff of Berlin, that, in
poisoning with sulphuric acid, after the greater part of the poison is
discharged by vomiting, the remainder may escape discovery by being
neutralized: For, although he could not find any free acid in the
contents of the stomach, he discovered 4½ grains in union with ammonia
by precipitation with muriate of baryta.<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c013'><sup>[99]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It may be also right to mention another kind of decomposition
which may render it impossible to detect a poison that has been really
swallowed—namely, that arising from decay of the body. In several
recent cases bodies have been disinterred and examined for
poison months or even years after death. In these and similar cases
it would be unreasonable to expect always to find the poison, even
though it existed in the stomach immediately after death. Some
poisons, such as oxalic acid, might be dissolved and then exude;
others, such as the vegetable narcotics, will undergo putrefaction;
and others, such as prussic acid, are partly volatilized, partly decomposed,
so as to be undistinguishable in the course of a few days only.
The mineral poisons, those at least which are solid, are not liable to
be so dissipated or destroyed. Some authors, indeed, have said that
arsenic may disappear in consequence of its uniting with hydrogen disengaged
during the progress of putrefaction, and so escaping in the form
of arseniuretted-hydrogen gas; and they have endeavoured to account
in this way for the non-discovery of it in the bodies of the people
who had been killed by arsenic, and disinterred for examination many
months afterwards.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c013'><sup>[100]</sup></a> But the supposition is by no means probable:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>at least arsenic has been detected in the body fourteen months, nay,
even seven years, after interment. For farther details, on this curious
topic, the reader may turn to the article Arsenic.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the whole, the result of the most recent researches is that the
effect of the spontaneous decay of dead animal matter in involving
poisons in the general decomposition appears to be much less considerable
than might be anticipated. For this most important medico-legal
fact, the toxicologist is indebted to the experimental inquiries
of MM. Orfila and Lesueur.<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c013'><sup>[101]</sup></a> The poisons tried by them were—sulphuric
and nitric acids, arsenic, corrosive sublimate, tartar-emetic,
sugar of lead, protomuriate of tin, blue vitriol, verdigris, lunar
caustic, muriate of gold, acetate of morphia, muriate of brucia, acetate
of strychnia, hydrocyanic acid, opium, and cantharides. They found
that after a time the acids become neutralized by the ammonia disengaged
during the decay of animal matter;—that by the action of
the animal matter the salts of mercury, antimony, copper, tin, gold,
silver, and likewise the salts of the vegetable alkaloids, undergo
chemical decomposition, in consequence of which the bases become
less soluble in water, or altogether insoluble;—that acids may be
detected after several years’ interment, not always, however, in the
free state;—that the bases of the decomposed metallic salts may also
be found after interment for several years;—that arsenic, opium, and
cantharides undergo little change after a long interval of time, and
are scarcely more difficult to discover in decayed, than in recent animal
mixtures;—but that hydrocyanic acid disappears very soon, so
as to be undistinguishable in the course of a few days.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Lastly, the poison which has been absorbed into the system,
and may consequently be detected in certain circumstances in the
textures of the body at a distance from the alimentary canal, may
also be removed beyond the reach of analysis, by being gradually
discharged along with the excretions. It has been fully proved in
recent times, that in poisoning with arsenic the poison may be found
in ordinary cases, for some days after being swallowed, in the liver
especially, but also in the other textures, in the blood, and in the
urine; but that if a flow of urine be established and kept up, in nine or
ten days, and sometimes much sooner, it can no longer be discovered
anywhere by the nicest analysis.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c013'><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Is the discovery of poison in the body or the evacuations essential to
establish a charge of poisoning?</i> It was mentioned at the commencement
of the present section, that the chemical evidence is generally,
and correctly, considered the most decisive of all the branches of
proof in cases of poisoning. But some toxicologists have even gone
so far as to maintain that without chemical evidence, or rather, in
more general terms, without the discovery of poison either in the
body itself or in the evacuations,—no charge of poisoning ought to
be held as proved. This, however, is a doctrine to which I cannot
assent. In the preceding observations on the evidence of general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>poisoning it has been several times alluded to as unsound; and repeated
opportunities of establishing exceptions will occur in the
course of this work, under the head of individual poisons. At present
it may be well to illustrate its unsoundness in reference to those
charges of poisoning, where no particular poison is pointed at by
the medical evidence, but where a whole class of poisons must be
kept more or less in view. Even here I apprehend there may be
sufficient evidence in the symptoms and morbid appearances, without
any chemical facts,—to render poisoning so highly probable, that in
conjunction with strong moral evidence, no sensible man can entertain
any doubt on the subject. Several illustrations might be here
given; and some will be found scattered throughout the work. In
the present place a few instances will be mentioned which cannot be
conveniently arranged any where else, and which are well worthy of
notice, as being striking examples of the decision of questions of
poisoning without chemical evidence.</p>

<p class='c006'>A man of doubtful character and morals, well acquainted with
chemistry and medical jurisprudence, and of disordered finances, was
known to harbour a design on a friend’s wife, who possessed a considerable
fortune. At last he one morning invited the husband to
breakfast with him at a tavern; and they breakfasted, in a private
apartment, on beef-steaks, fried potatoes, eels, claret, and rum.
They had scarcely commenced the meal when his guest complained
of feeling unwell; and soon afterwards he vomited violently. This
symptom continued, along with excruciating pain in the belly, for a
long time before the prisoner sent for medical aid; indeed he did not
procure a physician till the sufferer had been also attacked with
very frequent and involuntary purging. The physician, who, before
seeing his patient, had received the prisoner’s explanation of the apparent
cause of the illness, was led at first to impute the whole to
cholera caught by exposure to cold; but on returning at seven in
the evening, and finding the gentleman had been dead for an hour,
he at once exclaimed that he had been poisoned. On the body being
inspected much external lividity was found, contraction of the fingers,
and great inflammation of the stomach and intestines, presenting
an appearance like that of gangrene.<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c013'><sup>[103]</sup></a> On analyzing some fluid
left in the stomach, no arsenic or other poison could be detected. The
attention of the inspectors was turned specially to arsenic, because the
prisoner was proved to have bought that poison, and to have made
a solution of some white powder in his kitchen not long before the
deceased died. The prisoner in his defence stated, that the deceased
had been for some time much weakened by the use of mercury,
and while in this state was seized with cholera; and he likewise
attempted to make it probable that the man, in despair at his
not recovering from a venereal disease, might have committed suicide.
The council of physicians who were required to give their
opinion on the case state on the contrary, that the diseased was a
healthy man, without any apparent disposition to disease; that there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>was no pretext whatever for supposing suicide; that the inflammatory
state of the stomach and bowels supplied strong probability of poisoning
with arsenic, but not certain evidence; that acute gastritis from
natural causes is always attended with constipation; that the deceased
presented symptoms of stupor and other signs of derangement
of the nervous system remarked in rapid cases of poisoning with arsenic;
that cholera is very rare at the end of November, the season
when this incident occurred; and that the poison might well be discharged
by vomiting. Although all the prisoner’s statements in defence
were contradicted by satisfactory proof, and the medical evidence
of poisoning was supported by a chain of the strongest general
circumstances, the crime was considered by the court as not fully
proved, because the prisoner could not be induced to confess, and
because poison was not actually detected in the body. But on account
of the very strong probability of his guilt, he was, in conformity
with the strange practice of German courts in the like cases, condemned
to fifteen years’ imprisonment.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c013'><sup>[104]</sup></a> In this instance—considering
the kind of symptoms, their commencement during a meal, the
rapidity of death, the signs of violent inflammation in the stomach
after so short an illness, and the facility with which the absence of
poison in the contents of the stomach may be accounted for, more
especially if it be supposed that the poison was administered in solution,—I
consider the medical evidence of death by poisoning so
very strong, that, the general evidence being also extremely strong,
the prisoner’s guilt was fully demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c006'>A case of the same kind, but of still greater interest, is that of
Mary Anne M’Conkey, who was tried at the Monaghan Assizes in
1841 for the murder of her husband. I am indebted for the particulars
to Dr. Geoghegan, one of the principal Crown witnesses.
The prisoner who had been too intimate with another man, and had
been heard to express her intention of getting rid of her husband,
was observed one day before dinner to separate some greens for him
from the plateful intended for the rest of the family. None of the
latter suffered at all. But her husband was taken violently ill immediately
after dinner, and died; and a neighbour accidentally present,
who partook, though sparingly, of the same dish with him, was also
similarly and violently affected but recovered. The deceased before
finishing the greens said they had a disagreeable sharp taste, and was
seized soon after with burning at the heart, tenderness at the pit
of the stomach, vomiting, coldness, a sense of biting in the tongue
and tingling through the whole flesh, excessive restlessness, occasional
incoherence, locked-jaw, clenching of the hands, and frothing at the
mouth; and he expired three hours after the meal. His neighbour,
two minutes after finishing his greens, experienced a sense of pricking
in the mouth and burning in the throat, gullet, and stomach;
then salivation, a feeling of swelling in the face without actual fulness,
general numbness and creeping in the skin; next excessive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>restlessness, coldness of the integuments, dimness of sight, and stupor;
about an hour after the meal he became speechless, repeatedly
fainted, frothed at the mouth, and clenched his hands; vomiting ensued,
with considerable relief, and subsequently he had frequent attacks
of it, with purging, tenderness of the epigastrium, cramps, and
tingling in the flesh; and from these symptoms he recovered so
slowly as to be unable to work for five weeks. The only morbid
appearance of any note in the body of the deceased was a number of
irregular brownish-black patches on the inside of the stomach. No
poison could be detected in the contents or tissues of the stomach;
none could be discovered in the house except a corrosive-sublimate
solution which the prisoner used for a gargle; and none could be
traced into her possession. A variety of circumstances of a general
nature, which are passed over here for brevity, as not strictly appertaining
to the present view of the case, threw very great suspicion
over the prisoner. The medical witnesses deposed, that poisoning
could alone explain the medical circumstances; and Dr. Geoghegan
was of opinion that death was owing to some vegetable poison, although
he could not specify the particular substance. He suspected,
however, that it was monkshood. In these views, when consulted by
him before the trial, I entirely concurred. Considering the taste
observed by the deceased at the time he ate the greens, the rapidity
with which he was taken ill afterwards, and the very peculiar symptoms,
unlike those of any natural disease with which physicians are
acquainted, and agreeing with those which are produced by monkshood,—considering
also that another individual, who partook of the same
dish with him, was similarly and simultaneously attacked, and with
a severity proportioned to the quantity he took, while other persons
who ate the same food from a different dish, did not suffer at all,—it
appears to me that poisoning was clearly established; and I also
think that the general evidence brought home the charge of administering
the poison to the prisoner. She was condemned and executed,
and confessed before execution, that she did poison her husband, and
that the substance she used was the powdered root of monkshood,
which is well known as a poison to the peasantry of Monaghan under
the name of Blue Rocket.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is scarcely necessary to add, that great caution must be observed
in applying the general principle here inculcated. But the opposite
doctrine, that no charge of poisoning can be established without the
discovery of poison in the body or in the evacuations, appears to me
a great error, though upheld by no mean authority. Under that doctrine
few criminals would be brought to justice, were they to resort
to a variety of vegetable poisons, which in certain seasons are within
the reach of every one.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section IV.</span>—<i>Evidence from Experiments on Animals.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Evidence from experiments on animals with articles supposed to
contain poison is more equivocal than was once imagined. But it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>may be doubted whether some medical jurists have not overstepped
the proper limits, when they hold it to constitute little or no proof
at all.</p>

<p class='c006'>Evidence from express experiments should rarely form part of a
regular medical inquiry into a charge of poisoning. For in the first
place, to make sure of performing an experiment well requires more
experimental skill than the generality of practitioners can be expected
to possess; then, as will seen in the sequel, evidence procured from
this source can very rarely be more than presumptive; and lastly, if
the quantity of poison in the suspected substance is great enough to
affect one of the perfect animals, it may generally be recognized to a
certainty by its physical or chemical properties.</p>

<p class='c006'>For these reasons it is not likely, that, in an inquiry undertaken
by a skilful toxicologist, he will put himself in the way of delivering
an opinion on the force of such evidence. But it is nevertheless
necessary for me to consider it in detail, because he may have to give
his opinion regarding experiments made inconsiderately by others, or
accidents caused by domestic animals eating the remains of substances
suspected to be poisoned.</p>

<p class='c006'>The matter subjected to trial may be either suspected food, drink,
or medicine; or it may be the stuff vomited during life, or found
in the stomach after death; or it may be the flesh of poisoned animals.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. The evidence derived from <i>the effects of suspected food, drink,
or medicine</i> is better than that drawn from the effects of the vomited
matter or contents of the stomach. But an important objection
has been made to both, namely, that what is poison to man
is not always poison to the lower animals, and that, on the other
hand, some of the lower animals are poisoned by substances not
hurtful to man.</p>

<p class='c006'>A good deal of obscurity still hangs over the relative effects of
poisons on man and the lower animals. There are two species,
however, whose mode of life in respect to food closely resembles
our own, and which, according to innumerable experiments by
Orfila, are affected by almost all poisons exactly in the same
way as ourselves, namely, the cat and dog, but particularly the
latter.</p>

<p class='c006'>In general poisons act less violently on these animals; thus two
drachms of opium are required to kill a middle-sized dog,<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c013'><sup>[105]</sup></a> while
twenty grains have killed a man, and undoubtedly less would be
sufficient. It appears that one poison, alcohol, acts more powerfully
on them than on man. There are also some poisons, such as opium,
which, although deleterious to them as well as to man, nevertheless
produce in general different symptoms. Yet the differences alluded
to are probably not greater than exist between man and man in regard
to the same substances; and therefore it may be assumed, that, on the
whole, the effects of poisons on man differ little from those produced
on the dog and cat.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>The present objection is generally and perhaps justly considered
a stronger one, when it is applied to other species of animals. But
it must be confessed after all, that our knowledge of the diversities
in the action of poisons on different animals is exceedingly vague,
and founded on inaccurate research; and there is much reason to
suspect, that, if the subject is studied more deeply, the greater number
of the alleged diversities will prove rather apparent than real. Both
reasoning and experiment, indeed, render it probable, that some
orders, even of the perfect animals, such as the <i>Ruminantia</i>, are much
less sensible than man to many poisons, and especially to poisons of
the vegetable kingdom. But so far as maybe inferred from the only
accurate inquires on the subject, their effects differ in degree more
than in kind. Some exceptions will without doubt be found to this
statement. For example, oxalic acid, besides inflaming the stomach,
causes violent convulsions in animals, but in man it for the most part
excites merely excessive prostration; and opium most generally excites
in man pure sopor, in animals convulsions also. Other exceptions,
too, exist by reason of functional peculiarities in certain animals.
Thus irritant poisons do not cause vomiting in rabbits or
horses, because these animals cannot vomit; neither do they appear
to cause much pain to rabbits, because rabbits have not the power of
expressing pain with energy. But exceptions like these, and particularly
such as are unconnected with functional peculiarities, will
probably prove fewer in number, and less striking than is currently
imagined. For it is, on the other hand, well ascertained, that many,
indeed most of the active poisons whose effects have been examined
by a connected train of experiments, produce nearly the same effects
on all animals whatever from the highest to the lowest in the scale
of perfection. It has been fully proved, that arsenic, copper, mercury,
the mineral acids, opium, strychnia, conia, white hellebore,
hydrocyanic acid, cyanogen gas, sulphuretted hydrogen, and many
others, produce nearly the same effects on man, quadrupeds, birds,
amphibious animals, and even on fishes and insects.<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c013'><sup>[106]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Accordingly there are cases, in which the evidence from experiments
on animals with suspected articles of food is unequivocal. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>example;—a sexton and his wife, who had got a bad name in
their village in consequence of informing against the bailiff for smuggling,
and who were on that account shunned by all the neighbours,
accused the bailiff and his wife of having tried to poison them by
mixing poison with their bread. Immediately after eating they were
attacked, they said, with sickness, griping, swelling, and dizziness;
and they added, that a cat was seized with convulsions after eating a
part of it, had sprung away, and never returned. A large portion of
the loaf was therefore sent to the Medical Inspector of the district;
who reported, that it seemed exactly similar to another unsuspected
loaf;—that, although he was not able to detect any poison, it might
after all contain one,—vegetable poison particularly;—but that he
could hardly believe it did, for he fed a dog, a cat, and a fowl several
days with it, and they not only did not suffer any harm, but even
appeared very fond of it.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c013'><sup>[107]</sup></a> In this case it was clear that poisoning
was out of the question. On the other hand, the effects of some
poisons on man may be developed so characteristically in animals as
to supply pointed evidence. Thus, in the case of Mary Bateman, an
infamous fortune-teller and charm-worker, who after cheating a poor
family for a series of years, at last tried to avoid detection by poisoning
them, it was justly accounted good evidence, that a portion of the
pudding and the honey, supposed to have been poisoned, caused violent
vomiting in a cat, killed three fowls, and proved fatal to a dog
in four days, under symptoms of irritation of the stomach such as were
observed in the people who died.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c013'><sup>[108]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>It has been farther objected to experiments on animals with suspected
articles of food, drink, or medicine, that it is difficult to administer
poison to them in a state of concentration, and to prevent it
from being discharged by vomiting. This objection, however, may
be obviated by performing the experiment in the way recommended
by Professor Orfila. A small opening is made into the gullet, previously
detached from its surrounding connexions, the liquid part is
introduced by a funnel thrust into the opening, and the solid portion
previously made into little pellets is then squeezed down. Lastly,
the gullet is tied under the aperture. The immediate effect of the
operation is merely an appearance of languor; and no very serious
symptom is observable till four or five days at soonest after the tying
of the gullet. Hence if signs of poisoning commence within twenty-four
hours, they are independent of the injury done by the operation.<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c013'><sup>[109]</sup></a>
This process requires some adroitness to execute it well. It cannot
be tried successfully but by a practised operator, who, for reasons
already given, would hardly ever try experiments of the kind with
suspected articles. Mention is here made of it, therefore, chiefly
because it is the best mode of experimenting in those cases in which
it is necessary, as will presently be seen, to determine disputed points
in the physiology of poisons.</p>

<p class='c006'>I may here shortly notice a method which has been lately proposed
for detecting poisons that enter the blood, and which is founded on
their effects on animals. M. Vernière suggests that advantage may
be taken of the extreme sensibility of the medicinal leech to procure
at least presumptive evidence, when no evidence can be procured in
any other manner. He has related some experiments to prove that
the leech, when placed in the blood of dogs killed by nux-vomica,
is affected even when the quantity of the poison is exceedingly small.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c013'><sup>[110]</sup></a>
It is extremely doubtful whether any importance can be attached to
this criterion, as every one knows that the leech is apt to suffer from
a variety of obscure causes, and among the rest from some diseased
states of the body.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. In the case of <i>the vomited matter</i> or <i>contents of the stomach</i> there
are other and weightier objections to experiments on animals.—In
the first place, the poison which has caused death may have been
either in part or wholly vomited before-hand, or absorbed, or
transmitted into the intestines, or decomposed by the process of
digestion. Secondly, though abounding in the matter vomited or
which remains in the stomach, it may be so much diluted, as not to
have any effect on an animal. And, thirdly, the animal fluids secreted
during disease are believed to act occasionally as poisons.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first two objections are so plainly conclusive as scarcely to
require any illustration. It may be well, however, to mention as a
pointed practical lesson, that Professor Orfila once detected a considerable
quantity of arsenic in the contents of the stomach, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>a prior investigation had shown that the same article produced no
effect on two animals, and where the reporters from this and other
circumstances declared, that in their opinion death was not owing to
poison.<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c013'><sup>[111]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The last objection is a very important one; but there is reason for
suspecting that it has been a good deal exaggerated by medical jurists.—Animal
fluids are certainly poisonous when putrid. The repeated
and fatal experience of anatomists, together with the precise
experiments of M. Gaspard and M. Magendie,<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c013'><sup>[112]</sup></a> leave no doubt that
putrid animal fluids, when introduced into an external wound, cause
spreading inflammation of the cellular tissue; and although Magendie
says he has found such fluids harmless when introduced into the stomach
of dogs,<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c013'><sup>[113]</sup></a> it is probable, from their effects on man, that they
will act as irritants on animals not habituated to their use. I believe,
too, that independently of putrefaction, vomited matter or the contents
of the stomach may be apt to make dogs vomit on account of
their nauseous taste; and perhaps we may infer, that they will also
cause some of the other symptoms of poisoning with the irritants, particularly
if not vomited soon after being administered.—As to the
influence of disease in rendering the contents of the stomach deleterious,
it is to be observed that the effects just mentioned are probably
owing to the influence of disease on the secretions, but that beyond
this we know very little of the subject. In authors I have hitherto
found only one fact to prove that disease can render the contents of
the stomach decidedly poisonous; and on the negative side of the
question there exists no facts at all. Morgagni describes the case of
a child who died of tertian ague, amidst convulsions, and in whose
stomach a greenish bile was found, which proved so deleterious, that
a little of it given with bread to a cock caused convulsions and death
in a few minutes, and a scalpel stained with it, when thrust into the
flesh of two pigeons, killed them in the same manner.<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c013'><sup>[114]</sup></a> It is not
easy to say what to think of this experiment; which, if admitted to
the full extent of the conclusions deducible from it, would lead to the
admission, that disease may impart to the secretions the properties of
the most active narcotics. Farther researches are certainly required
before this admission can be made unreservedly.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the whole, it appears that in the present state of our knowledge,
experiments or accidental observations on the effects of the contents
of the stomach, or of vomited matter, on animals are equivocal in
their import. At the same time it may be observed, as with regard
to articles of food, drink, or medicine, that the effects of some poisons
on man may be developed so characteristically on animals by
the contents of the stomach, as to supply very pointed evidence indeed.
Of the force of this statement the following example is a
striking illustration. In the case of a girl, who was proved to have
died of accidental poisoning with laudanum, the inspector evaporated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>the contents of the stomach to dryness, made an alcoholic extract
from the residue, and giving this to several dogs, chickens, and frogs,
found that they were all made lethargic by it, some of them oftener
than once, and that a few died comatose.<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c013'><sup>[115]</sup></a> Facts such as these,
agreeing so pointedly with the known effects of the poison suspected,
appear to me to yield evidence almost unimpeachable.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The effects of <i>the flesh of poisoned animals</i>, eaten by other animals,
constitute the least conclusive of all the varieties of the present
branch of evidence. For the flesh of animals that have died of poisoning
is not always deleterious; while on the other hand flesh is
sometimes rendered so by natural causes, as will be seen in the Chapter
on Diseased and Decayed Animal Matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>This subject stands much in need of careful and methodic investigation.
And it is of more practical importance than might be imagined
at first sight. For the question has actually occurred in a legal
inquiry in this country,—Whether poisoning in the human subject
may be caused by the flesh of a poisoned animal?</p>

<p class='c006'>In regard to some poisons it is well established, that animals
killed by them may be eaten with impunity, such as game killed
with the wourali poison, or fish by cocculis-indicus. This seems
the general rule. But it is not clear that all poisons are similarly circumstanced.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only systematic researches hitherto undertaken on this question
are some recently made at Lucca by Professor Gianelli; of which
however I have only seen an abstract. He found that the blood,
urine, and lungs of animals poisoned with arsenic acted as a poison
on small birds, such as sparrows, whether the parts were taken from
the body while the animal was alive, or after death; but that alcohol,
cherry-laurel water, corrosive sublimate, sulphate of copper, tartar-emetic,
acetate of lead, nitrate of silver, trisnitrate of bismuth, chloride
of tin, sulphate of zinc, laudanum, acetate of morphia, strychnia,
and cantharides, had no such effect.<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c013'><sup>[116]</sup></a> Orfila has since shown some
reason for doubting the conclusiveness of Gianelli’s investigations;
and on repeating them, obtained such results as render it doubtful
whether any reliance can be put upon experiments made upon small
birds.<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c013'><sup>[117]</sup></a> Guérard however has ascertained, that dogs, fed on the flesh
and entrails of sheep which had taken arsenic, were attacked with
vomiting and purging, became reduced in flesh, and at length would
not eat what was put before them; but none of them perished, or
seem to have been seriously ill. Arsenic was detected in their
urine.<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c013'><sup>[118]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The importance of the inquiry, which the preceding experiments
are intended to elucidate, will appear from the following singular case,
for the particulars of which I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Jamieson
of Aberdeen, who was employed by the authorities to investigate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>it. An elderly woman, who kept fowls which occasionally
trespassed on a neighbour’s fields, one morning observed four of them
very sickly; and in the course of the day they became so ill that she
killed them. She cleaned and prepared two of them for cooking,
buried another, and gave away the fourth to a beggar, who was afterwards
lost sight of. Next day soup made with the half of one of
the fowls was given to a little girl, who suffered severely from sickness
and vomiting, and also to a cat, which was similarly affected for
the whole evening. On the day afterwards the woman herself and
a female lodger, took broth made with what remained of the fowls,
and also ate the gizzards; but the remainder was thrown with the
offal upon the dunghill. In the course of five or six hours both
women were attacked with severe illness. One had sickness, vomiting
and great coldness; but after encouraging the vomiting with
hot water and then taking some spirits, she got better in the night-time,
and next morning was pretty well. The other, who was the
owner of the fowls, was seized somewhat later than her friend with
great thirst and shivering, and next day with pains in the stomach,
severe sickness, and fruitless efforts to vomit. On the sixth day,
when a medical man first saw her, she had great pain throughout the
abdomen, much thirst, difficult breathing, a red, dry tongue, and a
very frequent, small pulse. Next day the pain and difficult breathing
became worse; and in the evening, after an attack of sneezing, she
became gradually insensible and motionless, in which state she
remained till the tenth day, when she expired. The stomach and
intestines did not present any distinct morbid appearance; but the
vessels of the brain were turgid, there were about two ounces of
serosity in the lateral ventricles, both corpora striata were softened
anteriorly, and a clot of blood as big as an almond was contained in
the right anterior lobe of the brain.—A judicial investigation being
ordered, it was ascertained that the fowl which the woman buried as
well as the remains of the other fowls which were thrown upon the
dunghill, had been carried off. But on searching the dunghill more
carefully afterwards, the contents of one of the crops, which had
been taken out and examined by the lodger, were discovered in the
rubbish; and in the mass Mr. Jamieson detected a considerable
quantity of arsenic.</p>

<p class='c006'>This incident happened in 1836. More lately the same gentleman
met with another extraordinary attempt of the same kind. A farmer,
about to be married, gave directions for killing in the evening some
fowls which were to be sent to the house of his bride where the
ceremony was to take place. The killing of them however was accidentally
delayed; and next morning, on the hen-house door being
opened, the fowls ran furiously to the well, drank water incessantly,
and died in an hour. On examining the bodies, Mr. Jamieson found
arsenic in large quantity in their crops and gizzards.</p>

<p class='c006'>On each of these occasions a particular individual came under suspicion;
but the evidence against them was too slight to justify the
authorities in bringing a formal charge; and consequently the proceedings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>did not go farther. In the former instance the evidence in
favour of the flesh of poisoned animals being sometimes poisonous is
strong; and the history of the woman’s case, although death seems
to have been caused directly by apoplexy, renders it probable that
even dangerous results might accrue.</p>

<p class='c006'>The preceding remarks will enable the medical witness to know
under what circumstances accidental observations or intentional experiments
on animals furnish satisfactory proof.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before quitting the subject, however, I have to add, that there is
another purpose, besides procuring direct evidence, to which experiments
with animals may be applied with great propriety;—namely,
the settling disputed questions regarding the physiological and pathological
properties of a particular poison. The science of toxicology
is not yet by any means so perfect, but in particular cases topics may
arise, which have not hitherto been investigated, and which it may
be necessary to determine by experiment. Experiments on animals
instituted for such purposes by a skilful toxicologist are not liable to
any important objection. On the trial of Charles Angus at Liverpool
in 1808, for procuring abortion and murder by poison, a trial of great
interest, which will be referred to more particularly afterwards, it
appeared from the evidence of the crown witnesses, that the poison
suspected, corrosive sublimate, could not be discovered in the stomach
by certain methods of analysis; and that, although corrosive sublimate
is a powerful irritant, the villous coat of the stomach was not
inflamed. But then it was proved by experiments made by one of
their number, Dr. Bostock, that animals might be killed with corrosive
sublimate without the stomach being inflamed, and without
the poison being discoverable after death by the tests he used in the
case.<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c013'><sup>[119]</sup></a> An attempt was made on the side of the prisoner to throw
out this line of evidence as incompetent, on the ground of the discrepant
effects of poisons on man and on the lower animals. But it
was admitted by the judge, on the plea that it was only to illustrate
a general physiological fact, and not to infer proof of poisoning.
The importance of experiments on animals to settle incidental physiological
questions has lately been again acknowledged in a very
pointed manner in an English court of law: for a set of experiments,
to settle the question of the rapidity with which hydrocyanic acid
acts, was instituted before the trial by the medical witnesses, at the
request of the judge who was to try the case.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c013'><sup>[120]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section V.</span>—<i>Of the Moral Evidence.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>It is not my object to treat under this head of the moral evidence
generally, which is required to establish a charge of poisoning. But
as it is well known that in criminal trials medical witnesses have for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>the most part nothing to do with the moral proof, while at the same
time in cases of poisoning the medical and moral circumstances are
always intimately interwoven and apt to be confounded together, it
is necessary for me to specify those particulars of the moral evidence,
which either require some medical skill to appreciate them, or fall
naturally under the cognizance of the physician in his quality of
practitioner. I shall enter into greater details under this section than
may perhaps appear to the medical reader necessary, chiefly that I
may redeem the pledge given in the introduction to the lawyer and
general reader, and endeavour to show how powerful an instrument
a medico-legal investigation may become in skilful hands, for throwing
light on almost every branch of the evidence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The moral or general proof in charges of poisoning is almost always
circumstantial only. The circumstances of which it usually consists
relate, 1. To suspicious conduct on the part of the prisoner before
the event, such as dabbling with poisons when he has nothing to do
with them in the way of his profession, or conversing about them, or
otherwise showing a knowledge of their properties not usual in his
sphere of life:—2. To the purchase or possession of poison recently
before the date of the alleged crime, and the procuring it in a secret
manner, or under false pretences, such as for poisoning rats when
there are none on his premises, or for purposes to which it is never
applied:—3. To the administration of poison either in food, drink,
medicine, or otherwise:—4. To the intent of the prisoner, such as
the impossibility of his having administered the poison ignorantly, or
by accident, or for beneficial purposes, alleged or not alleged:—5.
To the fact of other members of the family besides the deceased
having been similarly and simultaneously affected:—6. To suspicious
conduct on the part of the prisoner during the illness of the
person poisoned,—such as directly or indirectly preventing medical
advice being obtained, or the relations of the dying man being sent
for, or showing an over-anxiety not to leave him alone with any other
person, or attempting to remove or destroy articles of food or drink,
or vomiting matter which may have contained the poison, or expressing
a foreknowledge of the probability of speedy death:—7. To
suspicious conduct after the person’s death, such as hastening the
funeral, preventing or impeding the inspection of the body, giving
a false account of the previous illness, showing an acquaintance with
the real or supposed effects of poison on the dead body:—8. To the
personal circumstances and state of mind of the deceased, his death-bed
declaration, and other particulars, especially such as tend to
prove the impossibility or improbability of suicide:—9. To the existence
of a motive or inducement on the part of the prisoner, such
as his having a personal quarrel with the deceased, or a hatred of
him,—his succeeding to property by his death, or being relieved of
a burthen by it,—his knowing that the deceased was with child
by him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Upon many of the particulars now enumerated, important evidence
may be derived from the medical part of the investigation; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>not unfrequently such evidence can be collected or appreciated only
by means of a medico-legal inquiry.</p>

<p class='c006'>1 and 2. On the first two articles, suspicious conduct or conversation
on the part of the prisoner before the crime, and the possession
or purchase of poison by him, little or nothing need be said.
The medical witness may of course be asked whether the conduct
or conversation proved betokens an unusual acquaintance with poisons
and their effects. And his opinion may be referred to regarding
the nature of suspected articles found in the prisoner’s
possession. As to the purchase of arsenic under the false pretence
of poisoning rats, it may be observed, that a great deal more stress
is usually laid on such evidence than it seems to deserve; for
there are few houses, in the country particularly, which are not more
or less infected by them. On the other hand, too little weight is
attached to the circumstance of the purchaser not having warned
his household of poison being laid. Such conduct ought in my
opinion to be accounted extremely suspicious; for so far as I have
remarked, the fear with which unprofessional persons regard the
common poisons is such, that I can hardly believe any master of a
house would actually lay poison without warning the servants and
other inmates of his having done so.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The next article, which relates to the proof of the administration
of poison, will require some details.</p>

<p class='c006'>Direct proof of the administration of poison by the actual giver
is very rarely attainable, that part of the transaction being for the
most part easily concealed. The proof of this point is justly accounted,
however, a very important part of the evidence; nay, on
some recent trials in this country the prosecution has failed apparently
for want of such evidence, although the case was complete
in every other particular. It is generally constituted by a chain of
circumstances, and these are often strictly medical, as will now be
shown by a few examples.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first place, pointed evidence as to the individual who
gave the poison may be derived from the chemical investigation,—for
example, from the comparative results of the analysis of the
poisoned dish, and of the articles of which it consisted. I am indebted
to my colleague, Dr. Alison, for the following excellent
illustration from the case of William Muir, who was condemned at
Glasgow in 1812 for poisoning his wife. In the course of the
day on which she took ill she was visited by a farmer of the neighbourhood,
who had studied physic a little in his youth. He learned
from her that she had breakfasted on porridge a short time before
she felt herself ill, and that she suspected the porridge to have
been poisoned. He immediately procured the wooden bowl or
<i>cap</i> in which the cottagers of Scotland keep the portion of meal
used each time for making the porridge; and finding in it some
meal, with shining particles interspersed, he wrapped a sample in
paper, and took the proper measures for preserving its identity.
He then secured also a sample from the family store in a barrel.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>The two particles were produced by him on the trial; and from
experiments made in court the late Dr. Cleghorn was enabled to
declare, that the meal from the bowl contained arsenic, and that
the meal from the barrel did not. These facts, besides proving
that the woman had next to a certainty taken arsenic in the porridge,
likewise, in conjunction with other slight moral circumstances,
established that the poison had been mixed with the meal in the
house, and on the morning when the deceased took ill, before any
stranger entered the house. The procedure of this farmer was precisely
that which ought to be followed by the medical practitioner
in a similar conjuncture.</p>

<p class='c006'>An instance of an opposite description related by M. Barruel also
deserves notice, as showing how evidence of this kind may afford,
in otherwise suspicious circumstances, a strong presumption of accidental
poisoning. Sixteen people near Bressières in France having
been severely affected with vomiting and colic immediately after
dinner, the bread, which was suspected, was examined by Barruel,
and found to contain a little arsenic. The flour of which the bread
was made had been taken from a large store of it, which, on being
examined, was also found to be similarly impregnated. As it was
extremely improbable that any one either could or would poison so large
a mass of flour, to attain any malicious object, it was inferred that
the arsenic had been mixed with it accidentally, and that the accident
might have arisen from grain having been taken by mistake to
the flour-mill to be ground, which had been intended originally for
seed, and sprinkled with arsenic to destroy insects.<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c013'><sup>[121]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It may be worth while observing, in the present place, that in the
instance of poisoned wine very important evidence may be obtained
by examining whether the wine with which the cork is impregnated
contains any traces of the poison. This method of investigation occurred
to me in a very singular case of poisoning with arsenic in
champagne, which happened in a baronet’s family in Scotland. In
this instance, however, such analysis was proved to be unnecessary;
for the gentleman himself brought the bottle from his cellar,
broke the wires and drew the cork, immediately before the wine
was drunk.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c013'><sup>[122]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>All evidence of the like nature, though it is at present often
procured from other sources, should, for obvious reasons, be invariably
collected, if possible, with the aid of a medical person. If
again a medical man is called to a patient evidently affected with
suspicious symptoms, and finds himself obliged to declare such to
be his opinion, his thoughts, as soon as he has given directions for
the treatment, should be turned towards that part of the evidence,
for the securing of which he is naturally looked to as the person
best qualified by previous education and his opportunities at the moment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>With this view, therefore, having ascertained in what articles
it is possible for poison to have been administered, he should at
once endeavour to secure the remains of the particular portion partaken
of by his patient, as well of the general dish, if it is an article
of food, and of the ingredients of which the dish was ostensibly
made, not forgetting the salt with which it was seasoned. A case
occurred some years ago in the north of Scotland, in which arsenic
was administered in porridge by mixing it with the salt.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is of great consequence, before proceeding to analyze such
articles, for example suspected dishes,—to be particular in investigating
every thing connected with the cooking, serving, and eating
of them. By doing so, not only will the chemical analysis be
facilitated, but likewise facts in it will be accounted for, which
might otherwise prove embarrassing, and even lead to the drawing
of false conclusions from the result of the analysis. This statement
is very well exemplified by the following incident which occurred
to myself. In 1827 a family in Portobello were poisoned by the
maid-servant; and it was believed, that, for the sake of a trick,
she had, while carrying to the oven the beef subsequently used at
dinner, maliciously mixed with it tartar-emetic or some other poison.
One-half of the beef having been preserved, and two persons of
the family having been very severely affected, Dr. Turner and I, to
whom the case was remitted, made little doubt that we should discover
the poison by chemical analysis: but we did not. Being
subsequently employed by the sheriff to inquire into the particulars,
I found that the poison had been mixed with the gravy, which had
been consumed almost to the last drop,—that the gravy had been
poured over the beef,—that the upper half of the beef had been
eaten,—and that the remainder which we analysed had been transferred
upon a different plate from that on which it was served for
dinner. These particulars accounted sufficiently for the poison not
having been discovered.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another mode in which the chemical part of the inquiry may contribute
to discover the individual who administered the poison is by
a comparative examination of the persons of the deceased and the
accused. The following very pointed illustration has been published
by MM. Ollivier and Chevallier of Paris.—A woman who
lived on bad terms with her husband was found dead on a roadside
the morning after having been seen drunk in his company
in the neighbourhood. The mouth, throat, and gullet were
proved by a careful analysis to be corroded with nitric acid, the
stains and traces of which were also found on various parts of her
dress, and on the hair, neck, and arms, but not on her hands, and
not lower down the alimentary canal than the upper fourth of the
gullet. Ollivier, suspecting from these appearances, that she had not
taken the acid voluntarily, requested to see the husband; whereupon
there were found on his coat, trousers, and hands, a great number of
stains, which, like those on the deceased, were proved by chemical
analysis to have been produced by nitric acid. Here it was scarcely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>possible to avoid inferring, that the man got these stains while endeavouring
to force his intoxicated wife to take the poison Marks
of nail scratches were also observed round the mouth and on the
throat; whence it was reasonably inferred, that, having failed in his
original plan, he had suffocated her with his hands.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c013'><sup>[123]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>While these illustrations are given of the conclusiveness of the
chemical evidence in fixing the administration of poison on a particular
individual, it is essential likewise to observe that the same
kind of evidence may be at times equally conclusive of the innocence
of a person unjustly suspected. This obvious and important
application of a chemical inquiry is forcibly suggested by the following
particulars of an incident related by M. Chevallier:—An individual
was accused by a woman of having tried to poison her; and
she represented that he had put the poison into her soup, while it
stood from one day to another in an iron pot. On making a careful
analysis of some of the soup which remained, Chevallier found it so
strongly impregnated with copper, that, supposing the sulphate was
the salt mixed with the soup, ten ounces must have contained twenty-two
grains. It then occurred to him, that it was important to examine
the iron pot, in which the poisoned soup was represented to
have been kept; for the probability was that a large quantity of the
copper, if any salt of that metal had really been contained in the
soup, would have been thrown down by the superior affinity of the
iron, and consequently that a coppery lining would be found on the
inside. He was led, however, to anticipate that no copper would
be found there, because there was no iron dissolved in the soup, as
would have been the case if copper had been precipitated from it
by the iron of the pot. And accordingly he not only found no copper
lining the inside of the pot; but likewise, on following the process
described by the accuser as the one pursued in cooking the soup and
in subsequently poisoning it, he satisfied himself by express trial that
there was nothing in the circumstances of the case which could have
prevented the iron from exerting its usual action on the salts of copper.
These conclusions, coupled with certain facts of general evidence,
proved substantially that the suspected person had nothing to
do with the crime charged against him; and he was therefore discharged.<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c013'><sup>[124]</sup></a>
A case somewhat similar will be related under the head
of Imputed Poisoning.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the second place, evidence as to the person who administered
the poison may be procured by considering the commencement of
the symptoms, in relation to the time at which particular articles
have been given in a suspicious manner by a particular individual.
The import of facts of this nature can be properly appreciated only
by the medical witness; for he alone can be acknowledged as conversant
with the symptoms which poisons produce, the intervals
within which they begin to operate, and the circumstances in which
their operation may be put off or accelerated.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Few cases will occur in which it is not possible to procure evidence
of the kind, when diligently sought for. It is often too very
decisive in its operation on judicial proceedings. In the case of
Margaret Wishart tried at the Perth Spring Circuit in 1827 for poisoning
her blind sister, a man who lodged with the prisoner and cohabited
both with her and with the deceased, appeared at first from
general circumstances to be implicated in the crime. He had left
the house, however, on the morning of the day before that on the
evening of which the deceased took ill; and he did not return till
after her death. Now her illness commenced suddenly and violently;
and arsenic was the poison which caused it.<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c013'><sup>[125]</sup></a> It was quite clear,
therefore, that the poison could not have been administered, at least
in a dangerous dose, so early as the day before she was taken ill;
and such I stated to be my opinion, on a reference from the Lord
Advocate. The evidence being also otherwise insufficient, the man
was set at liberty. In the case of Mrs. Smith tried here in February
of the same year, this branch of the evidence was made the subject
of question under more doubtful circumstances. The deceased certainly
died of poisoning with arsenic, and the prisoner was strongly
suspected of being the poisoner for many reasons, and among others
because, on the evening before the morning on which the deceased
took ill, the prisoner gave her in a suspicious manner a white-coloured
draught. Here the possibility of the draught having been the cause
of the symptoms must be admitted. But as they did not appear for
eight hours after the draught was taken, I stated in my evidence that
it was improbable the dose, if it contained arsenic at all, contained a
quantity sufficient to cause the violent symptoms and death which
followed.<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c013'><sup>[126]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The correspondence in point of time between the appearance of
symptoms of poisoning, and the administration of suspicious articles
by an individual, constitutes still more decisive proof in a set of
cases, in which it is of great value, as the chemical evidence is generally
defective,—namely, where poisoning is attempted with repeated
moderate doses. If the several renewals or exacerbations of
illness correspond with the periods when suspicious articles have
been given by the same individual, the circumstantial evidence of
the administration may be even tantamount to direct proof. Thus,
on the trial of Miss Blandy for the murder of her father, it was proved,
that Mr. Blandy on several occasions, after the prisoner received
certain suspicious powders from her lover, was taken ill with vomiting
and purging; and that on two occasions recently before his
death, when he got from his daughter a bowl of gruel which contained
a gritty sediment, he was attacked after a very short interval
with pricking and heat in the throat, mouth, stomach, and bowels,—with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>sickness, vomiting, gripes, and bloody diarrhœa.<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c013'><sup>[127]</sup></a> Here the
proof of administration by the prisoner was complete.</p>

<p class='c006'>These examples will show how the evidence of a particular person’s
criminality may be affected by the relation subsisting in point
of time between the commencement of the symptoms and the suspicious
administration of particular articles. But farther, the special
period at which the symptoms begin may even at times supply strong
evidence of his instrumentality, although there may be no direct
proof from general evidence of his having been concerned in administering
anything whatever in a suspicious manner. This statement
is well exemplified by the case of Mrs. Humphreys, who was
convicted at the Aberdeen Autumn Circuit in 1830 for poisoning
her husband, by pouring sulphuric acid down his throat while he was
asleep. It was clearly proved, as will be seen under the head of
sulphuric acid, that the deceased died of this poison; and the administration
was brought home to the prisoner in the following singular
manner. The only inmates of the house were the deceased,
the prisoner, and a maid-servant. The deceased got a little intoxicated
one evening at a drinking party in his own house; and after
his friends all left the house, and the street-door was barred inside,
he went to bed in perfect health, and soon fell fast asleep. But he
had slept scarcely twenty minutes, when he suddenly awoke with
violent burning in his throat and stomach; and he expired in great
agony towards the close of the second day. Now sulphuric acid,
when it occasions the violent symptoms observed in this instance,
invariably excites them in a few seconds, or in the very act of swallowing.
It was, therefore, impossible that the man could have received
the poison at the time he was drinking with his friends; and
as he knew he had not taken any thing else afterwards, and it was
fully proved that he had been asleep before his illness suddenly
began,—it followed that the acid must have been administered after
he fell asleep, the accomplishment of which was rendered easy by a
practice he had of sleeping on his back with his mouth wide open.
But, after he gave the alarm, the door was found barred as when he
went to bed. Consequently no one could have administered the
poison except his wife or servant; and it was satisfactorily proved,
that no suspicion could attach to the latter. Such was one of the
principal train of circumstances, which, as it were by a process of
elimination, led to the inference that the wife was undoubtedly the
person who administered the poison. Other circumstances of a
similar tendency were also derived from the medical evidence; but
these it is unnecessary to detail at present. I have related the particulars
of the whole case fully elsewhere.<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c013'><sup>[128]</sup></a> The prisoner strenuously
denied her guilt after being sentenced, but confessed before
her execution.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. The next article in the moral evidence relates to the intent of
the person who is proved to have administered poison. When the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>administration is proved, little evidence is in general required to
establish the intent. It is sufficient that the giver knew the substance
administered was of a deadly nature; and in regard to any
of the common poisons this knowledge is sufficiently constituted by
his simply knowing its name.</p>

<p class='c006'>In some cases, however, the exact nature of the poison is not established
with certainty; and then something else may be required to prove
the prisoner’s knowledge, and through that knowledge his intent. In
the case of Charles Munn, formerly alluded to [p. <a href='#Page_50'>50</a>], arsenic was the
poison presumed to have been taken by the deceased. But the purchase
or possession of it by the prisoner was not for some time satisfactorily
established; neither was there any chemical evidence, the deceased
having lived forty days and upwards after taking the poison. It was
proved, however, that whatever it was which had been administered,
the prisoner knew very well that what he gave was deleterious;
because he persuaded the deceased, who was pregnant by him,
to take it by assigning to it properties which no drug either possesses,
or is so much as thought by the vulgar to possess. On one occasion he
persuaded her that it would show whether she was with child, and on
another that it would prevent people from knowing she was with child.
In such cases, then, good evidence may be derived from the arguments
used by the giver to persuade his victim to take the poison; and
sometimes, as in the instance now mentioned, it will lie with the medical
witness to inform the court whether or not the reasons assigned
are false.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sometimes it has been pleaded by the prisoner that he gave the
poison by mistake. In all such cases, if he descends to particulars,
which he cannot help doing, there is every likelihood that the falsehood
of the defence will be made evident by the particulars of the story not
agreeing with other particulars of the moral or medical evidence. At
present it is only necessary to allude to inconsistencies in his story
with the medical facts. No general rules can be laid down on the
method of investigating a case with a view to evidence of this kind:
I must be satisfied with an illustration from an actual occurrence.
On the trial of Mr. Hodgson, a surgeon, at the Durham Autumn
Assizes in 1824, for attempting to poison his wife, it was clearly
proved, that pills containing corrosive sublimate, and compounded
by the prisoner, were given by him to her in place of pills of calomel
and opium, which had been ordered by her physician. But it was
pleaded by him, that, being at the time intoxicated, he had mistaken,
for the shop-bottle which contained opium, the corrosive-sublimate
bottle which stood next it. This was certainly an improbable error,
considering the opium was in powder, and the sublimate in crystals.
But it was not the only one which he alleged he had committed.
Not long after his wife took ill, the physician sent the prisoner to the
shop to prepare for her a laudanum draught, with water for the menstruum.
When the prisoner returned with it, the physician, in consequence
of observing it to be muddy, was led to taste it, before he
gave it to the sick lady: and finding it had the taste of corrosive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>sublimate, he preserved it, analyzed it, and discovered that it did
contain that poison. The prisoner stated in defence, that he had a
second time committed a mistake, and instead of water had accidentally
used for the menstruum a corrosive-sublimate injection,
which he had previously prepared for a sailor. This was proved to
have been impossible; for the injection contained only five grains to
the ounce, while the draught, which did not exceed one ounce, contained
fourteen grains.<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c013'><sup>[129]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>I believe it must be allowed, that, as the medical inquiries preparatory
to trial are commonly conducted without the inspector being
made acquainted with the moral circumstances in detail, it is rarely
possible for him to foresee what points should be attended to, with
the view of illustrating the intent. But the case now related will
show that it is impossible for him to render his inquiries too minute
or comprehensive; and more particularly, it shows the propriety of
ascertaining, whenever it is possible, not only the nature but likewise
the quantity of the poison.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. The next article among the moral circumstances,—the simultaneous
illness of other members of the family besides the person
chiefly affected,—depends for its conclusiveness almost entirely
upon the researches and opinion of the medical witnesses.</p>

<p class='c006'>The fact, that several persons, who partook of the same dish or
other article, have been seized about the same time with the same
symptoms, will furnish very strong evidence of general poisoning.
A few diseases, such as those which arise from infection or from
atmospheric miasmata, may affect several persons of a family about
the same time; and hysteria, and epilepsy, have been communicated
to several people in rapid succession.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c013'><sup>[130]</sup></a> But I am not aware, that,
among the diseases which resemble well marked cases of poisoning
either with irritants or with narcotics, any one ever originates in
such a way as to render it possible for several persons in a family to
be attacked simultaneously, except through the merest and therefore
most improbable accident. Cholera perhaps is an exception. But
when cholera attacks at one time several people living together, it
arises from bad food, and is properly a variety of poisoning. In such
cases, too, the fallacy may in general be easily got the better of, by
finding that the store or stock, from which the various articles composing
the injurious meal have been taken was of wholesome quality.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hence it may be laid down as a general rule, that, perhaps if two,
but certainly if three or more persons, after taking a suspected article
of food or drink, are each affected with symptoms, furnishing of
themselves presumptive evidence of poisoning, and have been seized
nearly about the same time, and within the interval after eating
within which poisons usually begin to act,—the proof of poisoning
is decisive. Several late cases might, in my opinion, have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>decided by this rule. Thus it might have decided the important
case of George Thom tried at Aberdeen in 1821 for poisoning the
Mitchells, and likewise that of Eliza Fenning, about whose condemnation
some clamour was made in London in 1815. In both instances,
as will be mentioned under the head of arsenic, the symptoms
were developed so characteristically, that from them alone
poisoning with arsenic might have been inferred almost to a certainty.
But even if the symptoms had been somewhat less characteristic, all
doubt of general poisoning was set aside by the fact, that four persons
in the former case, and five in the latter, were similarly and
simultaneously affected, and all of them at an interval after eating,
which corresponded with the interval within which arsenic usually
begins to act.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sometimes it happens, that while one or more of a party at a certain
meal suffer, others escape. Such an occurrence must not be
hastily assumed as inconsistent with poison having been administered
at that meal. For the guilty person may have slipped the
poison into the portion taken by the individual or individuals affected.</p>

<p class='c006'>If it be proved that all who ate of a particular dish have suffered,
and all who did not have escaped, the kind of moral evidence now
under review becomes strongest of all. It is well for the medical
jurist to remember also, that such evidence is very useful in directing
him where chiefly he should look for poison.</p>

<p class='c006'>At other times it happens that the several people affected, suffer in
proportion to the quantity taken by each of a particular dish. Too
much importance ought not to be attached to the absence of that relation;
for it has been already mentioned that habit, idiosyncrasy,
and the state of fulness of the stomach at the time, will modify materially
the action of poisons. But when present, it will often form
strong evidence.—A good illustration of what is now said may
be found in the case of Thomas Lenargan, tried in Ireland for
the murder of his master, Mr. O’Flaherty. He had for some time
carried on an amour with O’Flaherty’s wife; and afterwards, to get
rid of the troublesome surveillance of the husband, contrived to despatch
him by poison. The crime was not suspected for two years.
Among the facts brought out on the trial the most pointed were, that
O’Flaherty’s daughter and two servants were affected at the same
time with the very same symptoms as himself; that they had partaken
of the same dish with him; that the severity of their several
complaints was in proportion to the quantity each had taken; and
that others of the family, who did not eat it, were not affected.<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c013'><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Another remarkable instance of this kind has been recorded by
Morgagni. A clergyman, while travelling in company with another
gentleman and two ladies, was setting out one afternoon to resume
his journey after dining at an inn, when he was suddenly taken ill
with violent pain in the stomach and bowels, and soon after with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>vomiting and purging. One of the ladies was similarly affected, but
in a less degree; and likewise the other gentleman, though in a
degree still less: but the other lady did not suffer at all. Morgagni
found, that this lady was the only one of the party who had not tasted
a dish of soup at the commencement of dinner. But he was puzzled
on finding that the gentleman who suffered least had taken the largest
share of the soup, while the clergyman had taken less than
either of the two that were seized along with him. He then remembered,
however, that in the district where the accident happened, it
was the custom to use scraped cheese with the soup in question;
and on inquiry he was informed that they had each added to the soup
a quantity of cheese proportioned to the severity of their illness.
Here, therefore, Morgagni was led to suspect the presence of poison;
and accordingly, after the whole party had fortunately recovered, the
innkeeper acknowledged, that in the hurry of preparation, he had
served up to his guests cheese seasoned with arsenic to poison rats.<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c013'><sup>[132]</sup></a>
This interesting anecdote shows, that the truth in such cases is not
always to be discovered without minute inquiry and considerable
adroitness. In the case of poisoning with arsenic in wine formerly
alluded to,—where all the individuals at table, to the amount of
six, were severely affected during dinner,—the soup was the article
suspected, because all had partaken of it; and, accordingly, the soup
and vomited matter were sent to me for analysis. On detecting a
trace of arsenic in the vomited matter, but none in the soup, I suggested
that some other article might have been used in common by
the party, and mentioned the wine as a probable article of the kind.
It turned out that all had drunk a single glass of champagne from a
particular bottle; and in the wine remaining in this bottle arsenic
was found in the proportion of half a grain per ounce.<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c013'><sup>[133]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Cases of this nature are so instructive that no apology need be
made for mentioning one example more which lately came under my
own notice. In the case of Mary Anne Alcorn, convicted here in
the summer of 1827, of having administered poison to her master
and mistress (a case already referred to for another purpose, p. <a href='#Page_75'>75</a>),
it was proved that a white powder was introduced in a suspicious
manner into the gravy of baked beef, which gravy was subsequently
poured over the beef. Now the master of the family dined heartily
on beef, potatoes and rice-pudding, and mixed the greater part of the
beef gravy with his pudding; the mistress ate moderately of the first
slices of the beef, took very little gravy, even to the beef, and none
at all to the pudding; a little girl, their niece, dined on pudding
alone, without gravy; and the prisoner dined after the family on the
beef and potatoes. Accordingly the master suffered so severely as for
two or three days to be in danger of his life, the mistress was also
severely, but by no means so violently affected, the little girl did not
suffer at all, and the servant had merely slight pain and sickness at
stomach. The evidence thus procured was exceedingly strong, more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>particularly when coupled with the fact, that the beef used was half
of a piece, the other half of which had been used by the family two
days before, without any ill consequences.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. The next article of the moral evidence relates to suspicious
conduct on the part of the prisoner during the illness of the person
poisoned. Under this head it is necessary merely to state what I
conceive to be, with reference to the present branch of the proof,
the duty of the medical practitioner who happens to attend a case of
poisoning.</p>

<p class='c006'>In such a conjuncture he is undoubtedly placed in a situation of
some delicacy. But on considering the matter attentively, good reasons
will appear why he should adopt the course, which, I believe,
our courts of justice will expect of him, and keep some watch over
the actions of any individual who is suspected of having committed
the crime. On the one hand, no one else is by education and opportunities
so capable of remarking the motions of the different members
of the family dispassionately, without officiousness, and without
being observed. And on the other hand, it is undoubtedly a part of
his private duty as practitioner, to protect his patient against any
farther criminal attempts, as well as part of his public duty to prevent
the vomited matter and other subjects of analysis from being secretly
put away or destroyed. No one can be so occupied without
many accessary particulars coming under his notice. And certain it
is, that on several trials the practitioner has contributed, with great
credit to himself, a considerable part of the pure moral proof. For
an example of discreet and able conduct under these trying circumstances,
the reader will do well to refer to that of Dr. Addington, the
chief crown witness, both as to medical and moral facts, in the case
of Miss Blandy.<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c013'><sup>[134]</sup></a> It is almost unnecessary to add, that in acting as
now recommended, the physician must conduct himself with circumspection,
in order to avoid giving unnecessary offence, or alarming
the guilty person.</p>

<p class='c006'>7, and 9. On the seventh article, which respects the conduct of
the prisoner after the death of the deceased, and on the ninth, which
relates to the existence of a motive or inducement to the crime,
nothing need be said here. But on the</p>

<p class='c006'>8th article of the moral evidence,—comprehending the death-bed
declaration of the deceased, his state of mind, his personal circumstances
and other points which prove the possibility or impossibility
of voluntary poisoning—a few remarks are required, because an
important and little understood part of the practitioner’s duty is connected
with this branch of the proof.</p>

<p class='c006'>The question as to the possibility of the poisoning being voluntary
is one upon which the medical attendant will be expected to throw
some light, and into which he will also naturally inquire for his own
satisfaction. In doing so his attention will be turned to circumstances
purely moral, which may not only decide that question, but
may also criminate a particular individual. His inquiries must therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>be conducted with discretion, and for obvious reasons should be
confined as much as possible to the patient himself. They are to be
conducted not so much by putting questions, as by leading him to
disburden his mind of his own accord; and it is well to be aware,
that there is no one of whom a patient is so ready to make a confident
on such an occasion as his medical attendant.</p>

<p class='c006'>If disclosures of consequence are made, and the attendant should
feel it his duty to look forward to the future judicial proceedings and
to the probability of his appearing as a witness, he ought to remember
the general rule is, that his account of what the patient told him
is not evidence in the eye of the law, unless it was told under the
consciousness of the approach of death. Of late, however, the
rigour of this principle in law has been occasionally departed from in
Scottish practice; and in regard to medical facts ascertained in the
way here mentioned, many strong reasons might be assigned for such
relaxation. Evidence of the kind is technically called the death-bed
declaration of the deceased, and is justly accounted very important.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here it is right to take notice of a part of the death-bed evidence,
although it does not properly belong to the question of suicide, because
it should always be collected if possible by the medical attendant,
and with much greater care than is generally bestowed on it
even by him—I mean the history of the symptoms previously to his
being called in. On this part of the history, including particularly
the time and manner in which the illness began, medical conclusions
of extreme consequence are often subsequently founded: On a single
fact or two may depend the fate of the prisoner. It is not enough,
therefore, in my opinion, that such evidence formed a part of the
death-bed declaration. If a fact derived at second hand from the
deceased, and stated too by him from memory, is a material element
of any of the medical opinions on the trial, it is of much importance
that the information be procured by a medical man; and that the
person who procured it, whether professional or not, was aware at the
time of the probability of its becoming important. Such evidence,
although not collected with these precautions, is admissible; but I
have so often had occasion to witness the carelessness with which the
previous history of cases is inquired into both in medical and medico-legal
practice, that I do not see how it is possible to put trust in
evidence of the kind, unless it bear marks of having been collected
with care, and under an impression of its probable consequence.
These statements are well illustrated by the following example:—On
the trial of Mrs. Smith for poisoning her maid-servant with
arsenic, it was proved that some drug was administered by the prisoner
in a suspicious manner on a Tuesday evening. Now it appeared
at the trial improbable that this drug contained a fatal dose
of arsenic, because to her fellow-servants, of whom one slept with
her, and others frequently visited her, the deceased did not appear to
be ill at all for eight hours after, or seriously ill for nearly a day. On
the contrary, however, a surgeon, who was called to see her on the
following Saturday, a few hours before her death, deposed that, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>to information communicated by herself, she had been ill
with sickness, vomiting, purging, and pain in the stomach and bowels
since the Tuesday evening. This evidence, if it could have been
relied on, would have altered materially the features of the case, as
it would have gone far to supply what all the medical witnesses considered
defective, namely, proof of the administration. But at the
time the surgeon made his inquiries, he did not even suspect that the
girl laboured under the effects of poison. Neither he therefore nor
his patient could have been impressed with that conviction of the importance
of the information communicated, which was necessary to
insure its accuracy, particularly as it related to a matter usually of so
little consequence in ordinary medical practice as the precise date of
the commencement of an illness; and it would consequently have
been rash to adopt it in face of more direct and contrary evidence.
Any one who examines the details of this trial as I have reported
them, will at once see how much the case turned on the point now
alluded to.<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c013'><sup>[135]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='small'>OF IMAGINARY PRETENDED, AND IMPUTED POISONING.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>The present seems the most convenient place for noticing the general
mode of procedure by which the medical jurist may detect
cases of imaginary, feigned, and imputed poisoning. It is by no means
easy to lay down rules for the investigation of cases suspected to be
of such a kind. But an attempt will be made to state the leading
points to be attended to, and to illustrate them by the circumstances
of a few examples of each variety.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Imaginary poisoning</i> should rarely be the occasion of deception or
embarrassment. The same wandering of the imagination which has
led to a belief of injury from poison, will commonly also lead to
such extravagant notions relative to the mode of administration and
the symptoms, as will infallibly point out the true nature of the case
to one who is well acquainted with the real effects of poisons. It is
easy, nevertheless, to conceive cases which may be embarrassing;
and certainly, in every instance, the physician should proceed in his
inquiries with caution.</p>

<p class='c006'>It appears to me that in the first place, without seeming to take up
at once the conviction of his patient, he should scrupulously abstain
from treating it lightly, and should on the whole act rather as if he
suspected poison had been given. Allowing his patient therefore
apparently credit for the truth of his suspicions, the medical attendant
should request him to give a full history of existing symptoms, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>their origin and progress, of their relation in point of time to various
meals, and of the mode and vehicle in which the supposed poison
was administered. No unprofessional person can possibly go through
such a narrative, without stating many circumstances which are wholly
irreconcilable with the idea of poisoning generally, and still more of
the administration of a particular poison.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have met with two instances of imaginary poisoning, the nature
of which was thus at once made obvious by a host of impossibilities
in the narrative of the patient. One of these may be here given as
an example. An elderly lady, who had certain expectancies of the
death of a relation, conceived that the family of her relative had resolved
to defraud her of her supposed rights. She afterwards imagined
that an attempt was made to poison her, and camphor was the
poison she fixed on as the article which had been administered. In
its general or moral particulars the narrative was all plausible and
suspicious enough; but unluckily for its consistency, she stated that
the poison could only have been given in wine,—that she did not
remark any particular taste in the wine,—that her illness did not
begin till the day after she took it; and although she alleged, without
any leading question on my part, that camphorous perspiration was
exhaled on the subsequent day, the whole train of symptoms differed
entirely in every other respect from a case of poisoning, and resembled
closely in their origin and progress a case of slight general fever. The
incompatibility of her story with the idea of poisoning with camphor
will be readily understood by referring to what is afterwards said of
the effects of that substance.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Feigned</i> or <i>pretended poisoning</i> is more apt to escape suspicion,
and when suspected is commonly more difficult to develope satisfactorily;
for the actor has it in his power to lay his plans with care, and
even to become acquainted with the properties of the poisons whose
effects he intends to feign. Still he can rarely enact his part so well
as to deceive a skilful physician both by existing symptoms and by
his history of their origin and progress; much less can he contrive his
scheme so adroitly that it shall not be unfolded by the refinements of
chemical analysis.</p>

<p class='c006'>The investigation of such a case will be directed of course in the
first instance to the state and progress of the symptoms. Here, as in
imaginary poisoning, it is of moment to conceal from the individual
the suspicion entertained of his falsehood. For even if a person who
has actually taken poison knows he is unjustly suspected of feigning,
it is not improbable that he might try to mend his story with impossibilities,
and so lead the physician into error. In a case of feigned
poisoning an excellent mode of investigation is, after hearing out the
individual’s own story, to put a number of questions involving an alternative
answer, one alternative being compatible and the other incompatible
with the alleged nature of his illness. No unprofessional
person can stand such a system of interrogation, if skilfully pursued.
Not only will his answers be often wrong; but likewise his manifest
perplexity how to answer will of itself supply evidence of falsehood.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>In the next place, great attention must be paid to the chemical
analysis. A person who feigns poisoning will commonly produce the
poisoned remains of a dish, or some other article, which he represents
himself to have swallowed. Sometimes the substance contained in
it will prove on analysis not to be poison at all, as in an instance I
remember reading some years ago in a London newspaper of pretended
poisoning with arsenic, where the dregs of a bowl of gruel contained,
not arsenic, but finely pounded glass. Sometimes the quantity of a
real poison contained in the remains of a dish may indicate, in what
is said to have been swallowed, a portion wholly incompatible with
the mildness or severity of the symptoms. Sometimes the vomited
matter, even the matter first vomited, may not contain any of the
alleged poison. Sometimes poison found in matter alleged to have
been vomited may yield compounds during analysis which are not
animalized, showing that it never was in the stomach. Sometimes
the quantity of poison contained in such matter may be greater than
that alleged to have been taken. Sometimes the quantity contained
in the first matter vomited may be less than that contained in what
is vomited or said to be vomited subsequently. By these and many
other such inconsistencies the falsehood of the story may be unequivocally
unfolded.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following example will illustrate some of the rules now laid
down. A young married female, in the seventh month of pregnancy,
having been discovered by her friends to be secretly addicted to
dram-drinking, appeared to be much annoyed in consequence of the
discovery; and one evening was found apparently very ill by her
husband on his return from work. She represented that she had
taken arsenic with a view to self-destruction, that she was in great
torture, and that she was sure she must soon die. It was accordingly
found, on reference to a neighbouring apothecary, that she had the
same forenoon purchased about a drachm and a half of arsenic for
the pretended purpose of poisoning rats; and in the bottom of a teacup,
in which she said she mixed it, there was left a small quantity
of white powder, that proved on analysis to be pure oxide of arsenic.
Notwithstanding these strong facts, the mildness of the symptoms and
the composure with which she complained of her tortures led her
friends to suspect she was feigning. On investigating her case I first
ascertained, in farther corroboration of her story, that the powder
was nowhere to be found. But she then stated in reply to questions
involving an alternative answer, that the arsenic had a sour taste, and
that the pain began in the lower part of the belly, and spread upwards.
She likewise said that she vomited a mouthful or two into a
chamber-pot twenty minutes after taking the poison; that she vomited
no more till the apothecary was sent for, who gave her emetics of
sulphate of zinc, carefully preserving the discharges; and that she only
vomited when emetics were given. When I first saw her, five hours
after the alleged date of the taking of the arsenic, the skin was warm
and moist, the face full and flushed, the pulse frequent and firm, the
muscular strength natural. The chamber-pot contained only a small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>quantity of the fæces of a child and apparently a little water, but no
vomited matters, and no white powder. The fluid discharged in
presence of the apothecary was found on careful analysis to contain a
large quantity of zinc, but not an atom of arsenic. She gradually
recovered from the illness under which she laboured at the time I saw
her, and in two days she admitted she was quite well, but continued
to insist that she had taken the poison.—M. Tartra has related a singular
case of the same kind, where a young woman feigned poisoning
with nitric acid, and was not detected for several days.<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c013'><sup>[136]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Imputed poisoning</i> differs in general from feigned poisoning only
in so far as the symptoms which are feigned are imputed to the agency
of another.</p>

<p class='c006'>The imputation of the crime of poisoning by feigning or actually
producing the symptoms, and contriving that poison shall be detected
in the quarters where in actual cases it is usually sought for, has been
not unfrequently attempted. Two important continental cases have
already been referred to for other purposes [pp. <a href='#Page_66'>66</a>, <a href='#Page_76'>76</a>]; and I may
here relate the heads of two English cases, which are of great interest,
and will serve to illustrate the mode of procedure in such circumstances.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first of these, which I have related elsewhere in detail,<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c013'><sup>[137]</sup></a> is a
striking example of the power of science in eliciting the truth, and
redounds highly to the credit of Mr. Thackrah, the medical gentleman
who conducted the investigation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Samuel Whalley was indicted at York Spring Assizes in 1821, for
maliciously administering arsenic to Martha King, who was pregnant
by him. The woman King swore, that the prisoner, after twice trying,
but in vain, to prevail on her to take drugs for the purpose of
procuring abortion, sent her a present of tarts, of which she ate one
and a half,—that in half an hour she was seized with symptoms of
poisoning with some irritant poison,—and that she continued ill for
a long time after. Mr. Thackrah found arsenic in the tarts that remained
untouched, and likewise in some matter that was vomited in
his presence after the administration of an emetic, as well as in other
vomited matters which were preserved for him between his first and
second visits. Her appearance, however, did not correspond with
the complaint she made of her sufferings, her pulse and tongue were
natural, and on careful investigation the following inconsistencies
were farther detected. 1. She said she felt a coppery taste in the
act of eating the tarts, a taste which arsenic certainly does not possess.
2. From the quantity of arsenic in the tarts which remained she could
not have taken above ten grains, while even after repeated attacks of
vomiting, the alleged matter subsequently preserved contained nearly
fifteen grains. 3. The matter first vomited contained only one grain,
while the matter alleged to have been vomited subsequently contained
fifteen grains. 4. The time at which these fifteen grains were alleged
to have been vomited was not till between two and three hours after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>the symptoms began; in which case the symptoms would before that
time have been in all probability violent. The prisoner was acquitted,
and the prosecutor and another woman who corroborated her
deposition afterwards confessed that they had entered into a conspiracy
to impute the crime to him, because he had deserted her on finding
she was too intimate with other men.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another case not less interesting in its details was communicated
to me by my colleague Dr. Traill, who was consulted by the medical
attendant, Mr. Parr of Liverpool. A man accused his sister-in-law of
administering poison in his tea. He stated that he was seized with
pain in the stomach and uneasiness in the head half an hour after
taking the tea; and when visited soon after, the countenance was
anxious, the skin pallid, the pulse frequent, the throat red; and while
Mr. Parr was examining the throat, a quantity of matter was vomited,
containing a white, gritty, crystalline substance, which was afterwards
ascertained to be oxalic acid. The following circumstances, however,
proved that the poison could not have been given in the tea. The
man alleged that he remarked in the very first mouthful an acrid taste,
followed by sweetness, which is not the taste of oxalic acid. Notwithstanding
this warning, he drank the greater part of the tea. He
stated that the poison was dissolved in the tea, yet he vomited some
oxalic acid in the solid form. Granting he was mistaken in supposing
the whole poison dissolved, the quantity swallowed must in that case
have been large; and nevertheless the symptoms were mild, though
no vomiting took place for about an hour, and next day he was almost
well. Four other individuals had tea at the same time from the
same tea-pot, without sustaining any harm; and what remained of
the infusion did not contain any oxalic acid. Finally, his niece
took what he left of his tea in the cup, without remarking any unusual
taste; and in the unwashed cup not a trace of oxalic acid could
be detected. It was quite plain, therefore, that the man’s accusation
was false; and certain points of general evidence, coupled with the
medical facts, afterwards proved that he must have taken the oxalic
acid himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been alleged, that attempts have been made to impute the
crime of poisoning by introducing poisonous substances into the body
after death; and although I have not been able to find any actual instance
of such ingenious atrocity mentioned by authors, it must be
acknowledged to be quite possible; and the medical jurist should
therefore be prepared for the requisite investigations. Every case
may be clearly made out by attending to the relative effects of poisons
on the dead and on the living tissues;—a subject which will
receive some notice under the head of the principal poisons in common
use.</p>

<p class='c005'>After the preliminary observations on General Poisoning, I
proceed next to treat of Poisons Individually. The subsequent
remarks will be confined in a great measure to the most common
poisons, which will be examined minutely. The rest being mere
objects of curiosity, and hardly ever taken by man either intentionally
or by accident, it will be sufficient to point out their leading properties.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be well to point out in the first instance the poisons in
most general use. These will appear from the following Tables.

<p class='c006'>In Denmark, in five years ending with 1835, there were 99 cases
of poisoning of all sorts, 16 by arsenic, 74 by sulphuric or nitric
acid, 4 by potash, 1 by an unascertained caustic substance, 2 by
opium, 1 by litharge, and 1 by copper. Only 5 cases, namely, 3
by arsenic and 2 by sulphuric acid, were cases of murder, or attempt
to murder.<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c013'><sup>[140]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The classification of poisons has hitherto defied the ingenuity of
toxicologists. Formerly it was thought sufficient to arrange them in
three great classes, according as they are derived from the mineral,
the vegetable, or the animal kingdom. It is evident, however, that
the only sound basis of arrangement is their action on the animal
economy; for such a classification is the only one which can be useful
in practice. Now, when we consider what has been said on their
mode of action, or the symptoms produced in consequence of that
action, it must at once be perceived, that no system founded on either
of these circumstances can be logically correct. It would be very
desirable, if their mode of action could be adopted as the basis of
arrangement; but both reasoning and experience have proved this to
be impracticable. One very distinct class indeed might be formed
of purely local poisons, comprehending the mineral acids, the fixed
alkalies, and one or two of their chemical compounds. But a vast
proportion of the other poisons which act locally have also a general
or remote action; and on the other hand there are few of the latter
description which do not likewise act locally. Hence if all which
possess this double action were arranged in one class, that class would
include nine-tenths at least of known poisons; so that, in truth, the
labour of classification would still remain to be overcome.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>It would be even more fruitless to attempt an arrangement of
poisons according to their medium of action; for no sure criterion is
known, by which a poison acting through direct transmission of an
impulse along the nerves can be distinguished from one that acts by
entering the blood.</p>

<p class='c006'>Neither is the embarrassment of the toxicologist materially less, if
he attempts to classify poisons according to the symptoms they induce
in man. This is the principle now generally followed, and which in
common with others I shall pursue. But the reader will be at no loss
to discover that the partitions which separate the classes are exceedingly
slight, and that very many poisons might be arranged without
impropriety in either of two classes.</p>

<p class='c006'>The preceding statements show the impossibility of founding a good
system of arrangement on the only basis which can be acknowledged
philosophical and practical; and consequently, that, as the science of
toxicology now stands, we must altogether despair of forming one
that shall be even moderately satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the whole I see no reason for deviating from the classification
adopted in the first edition of the present work, being a modification
of that previously followed by Professor Orfila. In this classification
poisons are divided into irritants, narcotics, and narcotic-acrids.</p>

<p class='c006'>The class of irritants includes all poisons whose sole or predominating
symptoms are those of irritation or inflammation; the narcotics
those which produce stupor, delirium, spasms, paralysis, and other
affections of the brain and nervous system; and the narcotico-acrids
those which cause sometimes irritation, sometimes narcotism, sometimes
both together. Some writers still adopt a fourth class, called
septics, because they give rise to putrefaction in the living body.
But modern physiology will scarcely sanction the continuance of such
a class of poisons. For assuredly no substance can cause putrefaction
in the living body.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <span class='small'>CLASS FIRST.<br /> ON IRRITANT POISONS GENERALLY.</span></h3>

<p class='c012'>The class of irritant poisons comprehends all whose sole or predominant
action consists in exciting irritation or inflammation. That
is, it comprises both those which have a purely local, irritating action,
and likewise many which also act remotely, but whose most prominent
feature of action still is the inflammation they excite wherever
they are applied.</p>

<p class='c006'>This subject will be introduced with an account of the general
symptoms and morbid appearances caused by the irritants, and a comparison
of these with the symptoms and morbid appearances of the
natural diseases which are chiefly liable to be confounded with irritant
poisoning, or mistaken for it.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>
  <h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> I.—<i>Of the Symptoms of the Irritant Poisons, compared with those of natural diseases.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The symptoms caused by the irritating poisons, taken internally,
are chiefly those of violent irritation and inflammation of one or more
divisions of the alimentary canal.</p>

<p class='c006'>The mouth is frequently affected, especially when the poison is
easily soluble, and possesses a corrosive as well as irritating power.
The symptoms referrible to the mouth are pricking or burning of the
tongue, and redness, swelling and ulceration of the tongue, palate, and
inside of the cheeks.</p>

<p class='c006'>The throat and gullet are still more frequently affected; and the
affection is commonly burning pain, sometimes accompanied with
constriction and difficulty in swallowing, and always with redness of
the visible part of the throat and gullet.</p>

<p class='c006'>The affection of the throat and mouth precedes every other symptom
when the poison is an active corrosive, and more particularly
when it is either a fluid poison or is easily dissolved. Nay, sometimes
burning pain of the mouth, throat, and gullet occurs during the very
act of swallowing.—On the contrary if the poison is soluble with
difficulty, and is only an irritant, not a corrosive, and still more if it
is only one of the feebler irritants, the throat is frequently not affected
sooner than the stomach, occasionally not at all.</p>

<p class='c006'>The stomach is the organ which suffers most invariably from the
operation of irritant poisons. The symptoms referrible to their operation
on it are acute and general burning pain, sometimes lancinating
or pricking pain,—sickness, vomiting, tenderness on pressure,
tension in the upper part of the belly, and occasionally swelling. Of
these symptoms the sickness is generally the first to develope itself.
In the instance of corrosive irritants pain commonly commences along
with it. The matter vomited is at first the contents of the stomach,
afterwards tough mucus, streaked often with blood and mingled with
bile, frequently clots of purer blood. The powerful corrosives affect
the stomach the moment they are swallowed; irritants which are either
liquid or very soluble also affect it very soon; but the more insoluble
irritants, such as arsenic, generally do not begin to act till half an
hour or even more than a whole hour has elapsed.—The stomach
may be affected without any other part of the alimentary canal participating
in the injury; but much more frequently other parts suffer
also, and in particular the intestines.</p>

<p class='c006'>The action of irritant poisons on the intestines is marked by pain
extending over the whole belly, sometimes even to the anus. This
pain, like that of the stomach, is often a sense of burning; but it is
also frequently a pricking or tearing pain, and still more frequently
a twisting, intermitting pain like that of colic. It is seldom attended
with much swelling, but often with tension, and tenderness of the
whole belly; and at times the inflammatory state of the mucous coat
of the intestines is clearly indicated by excoriation of the anus and
prolapsus of the rectum, which is of a bright red colour. The pain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>of the bowels is most generally attended by purging, rarely with constipation,
frequently with tenesmus. The matter discharged, after
the alimentary and feculent contents have passed, is chiefly a mucous
fluid, often abundant, often also streaked with blood or mixed with
considerable quantities of blood. In some cases the intestines are
affected when no other part of the alimentary canal suffers, not even
the stomach. But much more generally the stomach and intestines
are affected together.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a few very aggravated cases of poisoning with the irritants the
whole course of the alimentary canal, from the throat to the anus, is
affected at one and the same time.</p>

<p class='c006'>The symptoms now briefly enumerated are accompanied in almost
every instance with great disturbance of the circulation—quick, feeble
pulse—excessive prostration of strength,—coldness, and clammy
moisture of the skin.</p>

<p class='c006'>The other symptoms, which are often united with the preceding,
do not belong to the irritants as a class. Perhaps, however, among
the symptoms of the class may be mentioned those of irritation and
inflammation of the windpipe and lungs, and those of irritation
in the urinary organs. A great number of the irritant poisons cause
hoarseness, wheezing respiration, and other signs which indicate
the spreading of the inflammation of the throat to the windpipe: some
likewise cause darting pains throughout the chest: and not a few are
very apt to cause strangury and other signs of inflammation of the
urinary passages.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of the effects of the irritants when applied externally little need
be said at present. Their most striking external symptoms will be
noticed under the head of one of the orders of this class, the vegetable
acrids. In the chapter on the local action of poisons some
account was given of the several effects which are produced by the
application of poisons to the skin. It is there stated that some
produce merely redness, that others cause blistering, that others
bring out a crop of deep-seated pustules, that others corrode the tissues
chemically, and so give origin to a deep slough, and that others
excite spreading inflammation of the cellular tissue under the skin
and between the muscles.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such is a general view of the symptoms caused by the irritant poisons.
This topic will be afterwards taken up in detail under the head
of the several species. At present an important subject remains for
consideration, namely, the natural diseases whose effects are apt to
be mistaken for the effects of poison. The remarks now to be made
might be extended to many diseases. In fact, they might be extended
to all which prove fatal suddenly, for all such diseases are apt in
peculiar circumstances to give rise to a suspicion of poisoning. But
those only will be here noticed which occasion the greatest embarrassment
to the medical jurist, and which are most likely to come
under his review in courts of law. They are the following:—Distension
and rupture of the stomach; rupture of the duodenum, biliary
ducts, uterus, or other organs in the belly; the effects of drinking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>cold water; bilious vomiting and common cholera; malignant cholera;
inflammation of the stomach; inflammation and perforation of the
intestines; inflammation of the peritonæum; spontaneous perforation
of the stomach; melæna and hæmatemesis: colic, iliac passion and
obstructed intestine.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <i>Distension of the Stomach.</i>—Mere distension of the stomach
from excessive gluttony may cause sudden death. Generally indeed
the symptoms and appearances in the dead body show that death is
the consequence of apoplexy; but sometimes not. In order to preserve
the continuity of the succeeding remarks on the diseases of the
stomach which imitate poisoning, it may be useful to consider in the
present place all the varieties of the effects of distension.</p>

<p class='c006'>Excessive distension of the stomach, then, sometimes causes sudden
death by inducing apoplexy, which is commonly of the congestive
kind,—that is, without rupture of vessels. Mérat has related
an instructive case of this kind. A man in good health, while
greedily devouring an excellent dinner, became suddenly blue and
bloated in the face; a clammy sweat broke out over his body; and
he died almost immediately. On dissection the stomach was found
enormously distended with food, and the vessels of the brain were so
gorged, that the brain appeared too large to be contained within the
skull.<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c013'><sup>[141]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>There is reason, however, to suppose that death from distension is
the consequence not always of apoplexy,—but sometimes of an impression
on the stomach itself. Sir Everard Home relates the case
of a child, who, being left by its nurse beside an apple-pie, was
found dead a few minutes afterwards, and in whose body no appearance
of note could be discovered, except enormous distension of
the stomach with the pie.—A still more distinct case in point forms
the subject of a medico-legal report by Wildberg. A corpulent gentleman
died suddenly fifteen minutes after dinner; and as he lived
on bad terms with his wife, a suspicion arose that he had been
poisoned. His wife said that he fell asleep immediately after dinner;
but had not slept many seconds, when he suddenly awoke in great
anguish, called out for fresh air, exclaimed he was dying, and actually
expired before his physician, who was instantly sent for, could
arrive. Wildberg found the stomach so enormously distended with
ham, pickles, and cabbage-soup, that, when the belly was laid open,
nothing could be seen at first but the stomach and colon. Some
white powder, found on the villous coat of the stomach, was at first
suspected to be arsenic; but it proved on analysis to be merely
magnesia, which the gentleman had been in the habit of taking
frequently. The diaphragm was pushed high into the chest by the
distended stomach. There was not any particular congestion in the
brain. Wildberg very properly ascribed death to simple over-distension
of the stomach.<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c013'><sup>[142]</sup></a>—In all such cases the symptoms may be suspicious;
but when carefully considered they can scarce be said to resemble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>closely the effects of irritant poisoning; and at all events the
appearances in the dead body will at once distinguish them.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. <i>Rupture of the Stomach</i> is not a common occurrence; but it
sometimes imitates in its symptoms the effects of the irritant poisons.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is generally the consequence of over-distension, combined with
efforts to vomit. The cause of it seems to be, that the abrupt turn
which the gullet makes in entering an excessively distended stomach
acts as a valve, so that the contents cannot be discharged by vomiting.
A case of this kind is related by M. Lallemand in his Inaugural
Dissertation at Paris in 1818.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c013'><sup>[143]</sup></a> A woman convalescent from a
tedious attack of dyspepsia, being desirous to make amends for her
long privations as to diet, ate one day to satiety. Ere long she was
seized with a sense of weight in the stomach, nausea, and fruitless
efforts to vomit. Then she all at once uttered a piercing shriek, and
exclaimed that she felt her stomach tearing open; afterwards she
ceased to make efforts to vomit, soon became insensible, and in the
course of the night she expired. In the fore part of the stomach there
was a laceration five inches long; and a great deal of half-digested
food had escaped into the cavity of the abdomen. The coats of the
body of the stomach were healthy; but the pylorus or opening into
the intestines was indurated; which had been the cause of her dyspepsia.</p>

<p class='c006'>In other cases of death from rupture the laceration is caused not
by the accumulation of food, but by the accumulation of gases arising
from depraved digestion, constituting a disease almost the same as
that which attacks cattle that have fed on wet clover. A singular
example of this rare affection, in which death was preceded by the
symptoms of irritant poisoning, has been noticed by Professor
Barzelotii.<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c013'><sup>[144]</sup></a>—Another case, which appears to have been of the
same kind, is mentioned in a late French journal. A child, a twelvemonth
old, after eating cabbage-soup, died during the night unperceived
by its mother. On the body being examined, a great quantity
of fetid gas escaped from the abdomen, and a smooth laceration like
an incised wound, three inches in length, was found in the lesser
arch of the stomach.<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c013'><sup>[145]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In other cases, however, it is not easy to say what occasions the
injury. An instance, for example, has been related, where the accident
followed the drinking of a little shrub and water. The individual,
a man of middle age, who had been long liable to fits of
severe pain in the stomach, going off with vomiting, was suddenly
seized the day after one of his fits with violent pain in the epigastrium,
extreme tenderness and tension of the muscles, and for a short
time with violent vomiting. In seventeen hours he expired. On
dissection a dark-brown fluid was found in the cavity of the belly,
and the fore part of the stomach presented a laceration four inches
long. There were likewise several lacerations, one of them three
inches long, which intersected the peritonæal coat alone.<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c013'><sup>[146]</sup></a> A case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>probably similar in nature has been described by Dr. Roberts of London,
that of a man who died of convulsions in five hours, and presented
after death a long rent in the stomach, with escape of its
contents into the general cavity of the belly.<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c013'><sup>[147]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Another rare variety of rupture of the stomach must also be particularly
noticed, because the course of the symptoms imitates very
closely a case of poisoning with the irritants. It is <i>partial rupture</i>,—or
laceration of the inner coat only. A very interesting case of that
description has been related by Mr. Chevallier. A youth of fourteen,
on the evening after a Christmas feast, at which he ate and drank
heartily, was attacked with violent and frequent vomiting. Next
morning he said he felt as if the blood in his heart was boiling, he
was unable to swallow, the pulse became irregular, and pressure on
the heart or stomach gave him excruciating agony. These symptoms
continued till the following day, when he vomited two pounds of
blood at successive intervals, and soon afterwards expired. The
inner coat of the stomach was torn in many places, and that of the
duodenum was lacerated almost completely round. No other disease
existed in the bowels or elsewhere.<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c013'><sup>[148]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Some of the cases now mentioned could hardly be distinguished
from the effects of certain irritant poisons by the symptoms only.
But the morbid appearances in the stomach will at once determine
their real nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>Rupture of the stomach, it may be observed, does not always
occasion the symptoms hitherto related. Sometimes it causes instant
death. Thus a healthy coal-heaver in London, while attempting to
raise a heavy weight, suddenly cried out, clapped his hand over his
stomach, drew two deep sighs, and died on the spot. On dissection
a lacerated hole was found in the stomach, big enough to admit the
thumb; and the stomach did not contain any food.<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c013'><sup>[149]</sup></a> This case,
along with those of Dr. Roberts and Mr. Weekes, will show that rupture
may take place without previous distension.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. <i>Rupture of the Duodenum</i> is a very rare accident from internal
causes. The following instance resembles considerably the symptoms
of irritant poisoning. A gentleman, 48 years old, quarrelled
violently with another while playing billiards immediately after
dinner. Soon afterwards he was seized suddenly with violent pain
in the stomach, vomiting, cold extremities, and a failing pulse; and
he died very soon. The mucous coat of the duodenum was found
much inflamed, and four inches and a half from the pylorus there was
a lacerated hole involving a third of the circumference of the gut.<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c013'><sup>[150]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>4. Under the next head may be classed rupture of the other organs
of the belly. <i>Rupture of the Biliary Ducts</i> for example, an extremely
rare accident, has been known to imitate the symptoms of irritant
poisoning, as the following case will show.—An elderly lady, after
a slight attack of jaundice, was seized with violent pain in the stomach,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>and vomiting recurring in frequent fits, and in seventeen hours with
extreme tenderness, tension of the muscles, coldness of the skin, and
failure of the pulse. She expired in twenty-four hours; and after
death the hepatic duct was found torn across, a gall-stone lay at the
opening of the cystic duct, the peritonæum was here and there inflamed,
and three pounds of blood and bile were effused into the
cavity of the abdomen.<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c013'><sup>[151]</sup></a>—The nature of such cases will be always
apparent on dissection, but by no means always from the symptoms.</p>

<p class='c006'>In like manner <i>rupture of the uterus or its appendages</i> may in certain
circumstances occasion similar symptoms, and so be mistaken
for the operation of poison. A striking example of the kind once came
under my notice. A middle-aged woman much addicted to drinking,
and on that account living on indifferent terms with her husband,
was suddenly seized at two in the afternoon with pain in the
belly, afterwards with vomiting and purging, then with extreme exhaustion
and coldness of the extremities; and at ten in the evening
she expired. A suspicion of poisoning having arisen in the neighbourhood,
a judicial inspection was ordered by the sheriff of Linlithgowshire,
where the case happened; and the examination was
entrusted to her medical attendant, Mr. Robertson, and myself. On
inquiry, it was found that she had taken nothing whatever after breakfasting
at eight in the morning, six hours before; and farther, that
the pain had begun violently in the lower part of the belly. These
two circumstances alone were almost, if not altogether, incompatible
with the idea of irritant poisoning having been the occasion of death.
But all doubt was completely removed by the inspection of the body;
for the lower part of the belly was filled with a great quantity of clotted
blood, which had proceeded from the rupture of a Fallopian conception.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. The next accident which may be noticed on account of its being
liable to be mistaken for the effects of poison is <i>sudden death from
drinking cold water</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Britain the most common form of death from this cause appears
to have been instant death, arising from the impression on the stomach.
It is not an uncommon thing for people to drop down instantaneously
and die on the spot, in consequence of drinking freely of cold water
or other fluids while over-heated.<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c013'><sup>[152]</sup></a> There is an interesting report
on a case of this kind by Pyl in his Memoirs and Observations. The
individual had been quarrelling with a companion, and in the height
of a fit of violent passion swallowed a glass of beer; when he dropped
down senseless and motionless, and died immediately. His wife
suspecting the administration of poison, demanded a judicial inquiry;
but nothing was found in the body to account for death. Pyl therefore
came to the conclusion that the man died from the sudden impression
caused by the cold beer.<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c013'><sup>[153]</sup></a> Dr. Currie, after quoting several
instances of the like kind, relates the following remarkable case which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>occurred to himself. A young man, having just sat down, panting
and bathed in sweat, after a severe match at tennis, drank greedily
from a pitcher of water fresh drawn from a neighbouring pump.
Suddenly he laid his hand on his stomach, bent forward, became
pale, breathed laboriously, and in a few minutes expired.<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c013'><sup>[154]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>But when combined with exposure to a burning sun, as in hot
climates, drinking cold water when the body is over-heated seems
often to excite along with irritation in the stomach congestive apoplexy.
Dr. Watts has given a good account of these effects as they
occurred in the neighbourhood of New York during the hot season
of 1818. During the summer of that year the thermometer often
stood in the shade so high as 92°; and the labourers in consequence
could not be restrained from drinking frequently and excessively of
cold water. Many were attacked with pain in the stomach, sickness,
giddiness, and fainting; next with difficult breathing, and rattling in
the throat; then with apoplexy; and not a few perished.<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c013'><sup>[155]</sup></a> These
symptoms are very like the effects of some narcotico-acrid poisons.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lastly, drinking cold water sometimes causes symptoms more
nearly allied to those of the pure irritants. Thus some persons, on
eating ices, or drinking iced-water, or cold ginger-beer in the hot
days of summer, are attacked with violent colic. Others in the like
circumstances are attacked with violent fits of vomiting.<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c013'><sup>[156]</sup></a> Haller
has even mentioned an instance of a man, who after swallowing a
large draught of cold water while over-heated, was seized with symptoms
of acute gastritis, and died in fifteen days: and in the dead
body the stomach was found gangrenous and ulcerated at its fundus.<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c013'><sup>[157]</sup></a>
M. Guérard relates a similar case, that of a quarter-master who, swallowing
iced-beer after a hurried journey in a hot day, was attacked
in six hours with shivering, then with heat and tightness in the pit of
the stomach, vomiting of every thing he took, anxiety, thirst and
frequency of the pulse; next with extreme prostration, cessation of
pain, hiccup, and lividity of the face; and he expired in five days.
Signs of inflammation were found in the stomach, such as great redness
internally, with spots of extravasation, and a blackish matter
like what he vomited.<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c013'><sup>[158]</sup></a> Cholera has also been sometimes referred to
the same cause. In the hot summer of 1825 it was remarked that a
great number of persons who used to frequent a particular coffee-house
in the Palais-Royal at Paris, and the owner among the rest,
were severely affected with cholera. Poison being suspected to be
the cause, a judicial inquiry was instituted. It was proved, however,
that similar accidents had been observed at other coffee-houses, in
other cities, and likewise in former hot seasons; and when the whole
medical evidence was referred to a commission of physicians and
chemists, they gave their opinion, that the disease was owing to the
incautious use of ices and iced-water in an unusually hot summer.<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c013'><sup>[159]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Perhaps cholera arising thus may prove fatal. The following extraordinary
case, which appears to have been of this nature, was
communicated to me by the late Dr. Duncan, junior. A bookbinder
in this city, previously in excellent health, rose one morning at six
to kindle his fire, and took a large draught of cold water from a pitcher
used in common by the whole family. He went immediately to bed
again, complaining of pain in the pit of the stomach, and extreme
anxiety, and affected with incessant vomiting. In twelve hours he
died without any material change in the symptoms, and no disease
whatever could be detected in the dead body. Dr. Duncan satisfied
himself from general circumstances, that poisoning was quite out of the
question; so that, however extraordinary it may appear, his death
could be accounted for in no other way than by ascribing it to the
cold water.—Hoffmann says he was acquainted with instances where
fatal inflammatory fever was induced by drinking too freely of cold
water, and a suspicion of poisoning in consequence excited.<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c013'><sup>[160]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>6. <i>Of Bilious Vomiting and Simple Cholera.</i>—Of all the diseases
which are apt to be confounded with the effects of the irritant poisons,
there is none which it is of so much importance that the medical jurist
should be able to distinguish as cholera. A trial for poisoning
with the common poisons hardly ever occurs, but an attempt is made
to ascribe death to that disease; for it is very frequent, and its symptoms
bear a close resemblance to those of the principal poisons of the
class we are now considering.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is unnecessary to give here a detailed account of the symptoms
of simple cholera. There is the same burning pain in the stomach
and bowels as in irritant poisoning, the same incessant vomiting and
frequent purging, the same tension and tenderness of the belly, the
same sense of acridity in the throat, and irritation in the anus, the
same depression and anxiety, the same state of the pulse.</p>

<p class='c006'>It would be wrong, however, to infer from these resemblances that
the two affections are always undistinguishable. Some cases of irritant
poisoning certainly cannot be distinguished by their symptoms
from cholera. Many other cases are similarly circumstanced, because
their particulars cannot be accurately collected. But there is no
doubt that in others the distinction between poisoning and cholera
may be drawn by the physician who has been able to ascertain the
symptoms in detail. At present those points of difference only will
be noticed which relate to the irritants as a class; others will be
mentioned under the head of poisons individually.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first difference is, that in cholera the sense of acridity in the
throat does not precede the vomiting, as it sometimes does in poisoning.
In cholera this sensation is caused by the vomited matter irritating
the throat, or perhaps by the irritation in the stomach being
propagated upwards by continuity of surface. But, whatever may
be its cause, it is certain that the sense of acridity or burning sometimes
remarked in cholera never begins before the vomiting. In
many cases of poisoning, though certainly not in all, it is the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>symptom.—The next difference is, that in cholera the vomiting is
never bloody. I have been at some pains to investigate this point:
and I have been unable to find any instance of the cholera of this
country, which has been accompanied with sanguinolent vomiting;
neither is such a symptom mentioned in any accounts I have read
of malignant cholera. This article of diagnosis will, of course, be
open to correction from the experience of other practitioners. Lastly,
a material difference is, that the simple cholera of this country
very seldom proves fatal so rapidly as poisoning with the irritants
usually does. Death from irritant poisoning is on the whole seldom
delayed beyond two days and a half, and frequently happens within
thirty-six hours, sometimes within six hours, or even less. Malignant
cholera frequently proves fatal in as short a time; but with
regard to the cholera of this country, I believe it may be laid down
as a rule hitherto unshaken by all the controversy to which the
subject has given rise,—that death is not often caused by it at
all, and that death within three days is very rare indeed. A few
cases of death within that period, nay, even within twelve hours,
have certainly occurred; but their great rarity is obvious from the
fact, that many practitioners of experience have not met with a
single instance, and others with only one case in the course of a
long practice. Dr. Duncan, senior, mentioned to me a case, the only
one of the kind he had met with, which commenced soon after the
individual ate a sour orange in the Edinburgh theatre, and which
proved fatal in twelve hours. Dr. Duncan, junior, also met with a
single case, which was the instance already noticed of cholera produced
by drinking cold water. Dr. Abercrombie also once, and
once only, met with a case fatal within two days.<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c013'><sup>[161]</sup></a> Mr. Tatham, a
late writer on this subject, met with an instance which proved fatal
in twelve hours.<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c013'><sup>[162]</sup></a> Dr. Burne of London has likewise related an instance
of death within fifteen hours occurring in a child.<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c013'><sup>[163]</sup></a> And I
was informed in 1831 of a case at Leith which ended fatally in
twenty-six hours, and was at first supposed by the unprofessional
inhabitants of the place to be an instance of epidemic or malignant
cholera. My colleagues, Drs. Home, Alison, and Graham, never
met with an instance fatal in so short a time as two or three days;
at a meeting of the Medico-Chirurgical Society of this city,
none of the members present could remember to have seen such a
case;<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c013'><sup>[164]</sup></a> and of the witnesses who were brought to swear to this
point on a well-known trial, all of them physicians of extensive
practice, not one could depose that such a case had ever come
within his personal observation.<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c013'><sup>[165]</sup></a> It has been stated however in
a controversial publication written by the late Dr. Mackintosh of
this place, that the author had seen many cases fatal within the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>period now mentioned.<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c013'><sup>[166]</sup></a> This is incomprehensible. For my own
part, I cannot help repeating, as the result of the whole inquiry,
that simple cholera rarely causes death in this country, in the
period within which irritant poisoning commonly proves fatal,—that,
consequently, every case of the kind will naturally be apt to
lead, in peculiar circumstances, to suspicion of poisoning,—and
that in charges of poisoning, rapid death under symptoms of violent
irritation in the alimentary canal, like those of cholera, must
always be considered an important article of a chain of circumstantial
or presumptive evidence.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. <i>Of Malignant Cholera.</i>—The history of this disease affords a
fair promise that, in so far as British practitioners are concerned,
it may ere long be excluded from the list of those which imitate
irritant poisoning. Meanwhile, however, malignant cholera must
be allowed to bear, in its essential symptoms and their course, a
marked resemblance to poisoning with the irritants. So much indeed
is this the case that some authors have actually compared its
phenomena to the effects of arsenic, tartar-emetic, and other powerful
acrids. In many cases the two affections are undoubtedly not
so distinguishable by symptoms as to warrant a physician to rely on
the diagnosis in a medico-legal inquiry. But in many other instances
the distinction may be drawn satisfactorily. Thus the uneasiness
in the throat which sometimes attends cholera never precedes
the vomiting. The vomiting in cholera is never bloody. The
colour and expression of the countenance and whole body are peculiar.
In frequent instances the early signs which resemble poisoning
are followed by a secondary stage, sometimes of simple coma,
sometimes of typhoid fever, which a practised person may easily
distinguish from the secondary phenomena produced by some irritants.
Lastly, no mistake can arise where the patient, before presenting
the symptoms common to both affections, experiences violent
burning pain or certain tastes, during or immediately after the
swallowing of food, drink, or some other article.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. <i>Of Inflammation of the Stomach.</i>—Chronic inflammation of the
stomach is a common disease; which, however, on account of the
slowness of its course, is not liable to be confounded with the
ordinary effects of irritant poisons. Acute inflammation, on the
contrary, follows precisely the same course as that of irritant poisoning.
But great doubts may be entertained whether true acute gastritis
ever exists in this country as a natural disease. Several of
my acquaintances, long in extensive practice, have stated to me,
that their experience coincides entirely with that of Dr. Abercrombie,
who observes he has “never seen a case which he could
consider as being of that nature.”<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c013'><sup>[167]</sup></a> An important observation of
the same purport has been made by M. Louis, one of the most experienced
and accurate pathologists of the present time. He says,
that during six years’ service at the hospital of La Charité, during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>which he noticed the particulars of 3000 cases and 500 dissections,
he did not meet with a single instance of fatal primary gastritis.
The disease only occurred as a secondary affection or complicating
some other disease which was the cause of death.<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c013'><sup>[168]</sup></a> So far as I have
hitherto been able to inquire among systematic authors, the descriptions
of idiopathic acute gastritis appear to have been taken
from the varieties caused by poison.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following are the only specific accounts I have hitherto met
with of an affection of the nature of idiopathic acute gastritis; and
the reader will be at no loss to perceive that in each of them it
admits of being viewed differently. The first two are the cases of
inflammation referred by Haller and Guérard to drinking cold
water incautiously [p. <a href='#Page_100'>100</a>]. The next is a remarkable incident related
by Lecat, and occurring in 1763. A girl, nineteen years
old, was attacked while in good health with shivering, faintness,
acute pain in the belly, cold extremities and imperceptible pulse;
and she died in sixteen hours. The stomach was found red, and
checkered with brownish patches and gangrenous pustules (probably
warty black extravasation): yet it was supposed to have been
ascertained that she had not taken any thing deleterious.<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c013'><sup>[169]</sup></a> This
narrative is certainly to appearance pointed. But when it is added,
that the girl’s mother was attacked about the same time with precisely
the same symptoms and died in four hours, I think the reader,
when he also considers the imperfect mode in which chemical inquiries
were then conducted, will by no means rest satisfied with
Lecat’s assurance that nothing deleterious was swallowed. The
last is an equally singular case given by Dr. Hastings, of Worcester,
where poisoning with cantharides was suspected. A young
lady, liable to indigestion, but at the moment in better health than
usual, was attacked with sickness before breakfast and after it
with vomiting. Three days elapsed before she was seen by her
medical attendant, who found her sinking under incessant vomiting,
severe pain in the loins, strangury, bloody urine, and swelling
of the clitoris, attended with red extravasation of the eyes, and a
red efflorescence on the skin. Death followed next day amidst convulsions;
and there was found in the dead body extravasation of
blood between the kidneys and their outer membrane, into the pelvis
of each kidney, and into the bladder,—redness of the bronchial
membrane, and gorging of the air-cells with blood,—and general
redness of the inside of the stomach, with numerous extravasated
spots in the submucous coat.<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c013'><sup>[170]</sup></a> It seems to have been clearly
proved at the coroner’s inquest that poisoning was here out of the
question. But the case appears rather to have been one of renal
irritation or inflammation than of gastritis, and the affection of the
stomach secondarily merely.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>The question as to the possibility of acute gastritis being produced
by natural causes is one of very great interest to the medical jurist.
For its possible occurrence is the only obstacle in the way of a decision
in favour of poisoning, from symptoms and morbid appearances
only, in certain cases by no means uncommon, which are characterised
by signs of violent irritation during life, early death, and unequivocal
marks of great irritation in the dead body, namely, bright redness,
ulcers, and black, granular, warty extravasation. In regard to these
effects, it may with perfect safety be said, that they can very rarely
indeed all arise from natural causes; and for my own part, the more
the subject is investigated, the more am I led to doubt whether they
ever arise in this country from any other cause than poison. The
possible occurrence of a case of the kind from natural causes must be
granted. But this concession ought not to take away from the importance
of the contrary fact as one of the particulars of a chain of
circumstantial proof.</p>

<p class='c006'>In whatever way the fact as to the existence of idiopathic acute
gastritis may eventually be proved to stand, an important criterion of
this disease, as of cholera, will be that the sense of burning in the
throat, if present at all, does not precede the vomiting.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. <i>Inflammation of the Intestines</i> in its acute form is more common
than inflammation of the stomach, as a natural disease. It is generally
accompanied, however, with constipation of the bowels. Acute enteritis,
unless we choose with some pathologists to consider cholera
as of that nature, is very rarely attended with purging.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is a variety of intestinal inflammation, observed only of late
by pathologists,<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c013'><sup>[171]</sup></a> but now well known, which bears a close resemblance
to the effects of the irritants. It is a particular variety of
ulceration commonly situated near the end of the small intestines,
accompanied at first with trifling or insidious symptoms, and terminating
suddenly in perforation of the gut. It begins with tubercular
deposition under the mucous membrane in roundish patches. Then
an ulcer appears on the middle of one or more of these patches, gradually
spreads over them, and at the same time penetrates the other
coats. At last when the peritoneal coat alone is left, some trifling
accident ruptures it, the fæcal matters escape into the sac of the peritonæum,
and the patient dies in great agony in the course of one or
two days, or in a few hours. Such cases, if not distinguished by the
symptoms, will be at once recognized by the morbid appearances.
Perforation of the intestines, with similar symptoms, also takes place
without the previous tubercular deposit, by simple ulceration of the
coats.<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c013'><sup>[172]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Another form of intestinal inflammation may also be here particularized,
because it imitates the effects of the irritants in the cases
in which they prove slowly fatal. It is a form of aphthous ulceration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>of the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal, which appears to
affect almost every part of it from the throat downwards, and begins
commonly in the throat. I once met with a remarkable case in which
it appeared in the form of little white ulcers in the back of the throat,
and gradually travelled downwards to the stomach and from that to
the intestines,—being characterized by burning pain in every one
of its seats, and successively by difficulty of swallowing, by sickness,
vomiting, and tenderness of the stomach, and finally by purging.
Such cases resemble the slow forms of poisoning with arsenic. But
they differ in attacking the several divisions of the alimentary canal
in turn, while in the examples of poisoning with arsenic now alluded
to, the whole canal from the mouth to the anus is affected simultaneously.
Dr. Abercrombie has described a similar disorder, which
he appears to have occasionally seen affecting both the stomach and
intestines at the same time; but he seems to doubt whether it ever
occurs as an idiopathic disease, or independently of some co-existing
or preceding fever or local inflammation.<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c013'><sup>[173]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>10. <i>Inflammation of the Peritonæum</i>, or lining membrane of the
belly, will not require many remarks. When acute, it is rarely attended
in its early stage by vomiting; rarely also by irregular action
of the intestines, and never by diarrhœa; and it is at once distinguished
in the dead body by unequivocal marks of peritonæal inflammation,
which are very seldom caused by irritant poisons.<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c013'><sup>[174]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>11. The subject of <i>Spontaneous Perforation of the Stomach</i> is an
important topic for the medical jurist, because both the symptoms
before death and the appearances in the dead body are occasionally
very like the effects of some of the most active irritant poisons. The
following is a statement of the most material facts hitherto ascertained
on this subject; but it must be premised that a good deal of obscurity
still hangs over some parts of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Spontaneous perforation of the stomach is of three kinds. One is
the last stage of some varieties of scirrhus. The indurated membrane
ulcerates, the ulcer penetrates first the villous, then the muscular,
and at last the outer or peritoneal coat, so that the contents of
the stomach escape into the belly. The symptoms of the perforation
are a sense of something giving way in the pit of the stomach, acute
pain gradually extending over the whole abdomen, great tenderness
and tension, excessive prostration, and death commonly within
twenty-four hours. The symptoms which precede the perforation in
general clearly indicate organic derangement of the stomach, namely,
aggravated dyspepsia of long standing. Several cases of this description
may be seen in a thesis by M. Laisné,<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c013'><sup>[175]</sup></a> a pupil of Professor
Chaussier. Two characteristic cases have been published by Dr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Crampton;<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c013'><sup>[176]</sup></a> and Mr. Alfred Taylor has referred to several others,
the stomachs of which are preserved in Guy’s Hospital Museum, and
gives the particulars of some which had occurred in the practice of
that institution or to his friends.<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c013'><sup>[177]</sup></a> Occasionally no symptom exists
prior to the perforation, as in an instance related by Dr. Kelly of a
stout healthy servant, who was suddenly seized with excruciating
pain in the stomach and expired in eighteen hours, and in whose
body the stomach was found perforated in the middle of an extensive
thickening and induration of the villous coat.<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c013'><sup>[178]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The second variety of perforation takes place by simple ulceration
without previous scirrhus. In one of Dr. Crampton’s papers will
be found some remarks by Mr. Travers, along with a case of this
kind. The subject of it was a man of a strumous habit, who enjoyed
good health, till one day at dinner he was suddenly attacked with
acute pain in the pit of the stomach, and died in thirteen hours.
The stomach was found perforated in the centre of a superficial ulcer
of the mucous coat, occupying two-thirds of the ring of the pylorus.<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c013'><sup>[179]</sup></a>
This case shows that the present variety of perforation may take place
without the preliminary organic disease being indicated by any
symptom. The circumstances under which it commenced are peculiarly
important in relation to the medical jurisprudence of poisoning.
Another case which has been lately described with great
exactness by M. Duparcque, was preceded only by very trivial dyspeptic
symptoms. Here the whole mischief arose from a small ulcer
eight lines long and five in breadth on the inside of the stomach, and
not more than a line and a half in diameter at the perforation
through the peritonæum.<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c013'><sup>[180]</sup></a> Several excellent examples of the same
disease have been related by Dr. Abercrombie.<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c013'><sup>[181]</sup></a> In one of these
the ulcer in the centre of which the perforation had been formed,
was not bigger than a shilling, and the rest of the stomach quite
healthy. A very instructive case of a similar nature, but of unusual
duration, has been related by Mr. Alfred Taylor. A young woman,
after suffering for some time from nausea and constant craving for
food, but inability to indulge it, and occasionally from pain in the
stomach, was attacked suddenly with the usual symptoms of perforation,
and died forty-two hours afterwards. The villous coat of
the stomach, though generally healthy, presented at the lesser curvature
several small elevated points, and in the middle of two of
these a sharply-defined ulcer, one affecting the mucous coat only,
while the other, which was half an inch in diameter where it affected
the mucous coat, perforated the muscular and peritonæal coats by a
hole no bigger than a crow-quill.<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c013'><sup>[182]</sup></a> A case still more remarkable has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>been also related by the same author, where the circumstances naturally
gave rise to a strong suspicion of poisoning. A young female
in a noble family, subject to slight dyspepsia, was suddenly attacked,
three hours after a meal, with violent vomiting and pain in the belly.
Collapse soon ensued, and in fifteen hours she died, under so strong
suspicions of poisoning that various antidotes were administered.
This suspicion was in some measure borne out by proofs of an intrigue
having been carried on between her and a male person in the house,
and by the discovery after death of the signs of recent sexual intercourse.
On examining the cavity of the abdomen, however, there
was found, at the upper and back part of the stomach near the pylorus,
an oval perforation, half an inch wide, surrounded by a firm, smooth,
almost cartilaginous margin, without any inflammation near it. Mr.
Taylor properly points out, that the sudden occurrence of such violent
symptoms so long after a meal is incompatible with the action of any
poison which could cause perforation in fifteen hours; and that the
characters of the perforation were those of a natural disease long
latent. He could not detect a trace of any poison in the stomach.<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c013'><sup>[183]</sup></a>—In
some cases, as in that of M. Duparcque, the pain at the moment
the perforation is completed is not at first violent, because the close
proximity of some adjoining organ, such as the liver, prevents the
contents of the stomach from escaping for a time, so that inflammation
of the peritonæum is but gradually developed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The third variety of spontaneous perforation is of a much more
singular kind. It is produced not by ordinary ulceration, but by a
jelly-like softening of the coats. The gelatinization sometimes extends
over a great extent of surface, affecting chiefly the villous coat,
so that the aperture through the other membranes is surrounded by
extensive pulpiness of the internal membrane. It is seldom accompanied
by vascularity. Its symptoms are exceedingly obscure. In
adults there is very rarely any symptom at all till the perforation is
complete;<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c013'><sup>[184]</sup></a> in children, as appears from a paper by Dr. J. Gairdner of
this city, and another by Dr. Pitschaft, a German author,<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c013'><sup>[185]</sup></a> the early
symptoms indicate an obscure chronic gastritis. The nature of this
singular disease will be discussed in the section on the morbid appearances.
At present it may merely be observed, that the injury
caused to the coats of the stomach seems to be precisely the same
with the gelatinization, which is sometimes found after death in persons
who had no symptoms of an affection of the stomach, and which
is ascribed by John Hunter,<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c013'><sup>[186]</sup></a> and most British pathologists, to the
solvent action of the gastric juice in the dead body. This disease is
well described by Laisné in his thesis formerly quoted. The following
is a good example: a young lady, previously in good health,
was awakened at three one morning with excruciating pain in the
stomach, which nothing could alleviate. She expired seven hours
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>after; and on dissection two holes were found in the back part of the
stomach, surrounded with much softening of the villous coat.<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c013'><sup>[187]</sup></a>
Another case will be mentioned in page <a href='#Page_118'>118</a>.—The appearances
produced by this disease have been mistaken for the effects of corrosive
poisons.</p>

<p class='c006'>12. The <i>gullet</i> may be perforated in a similar manner either with
or without symptoms. Under the head of the morbid appearances
(<a href='#Page_119'>119</a>) two instances will be mentioned in which there were no corresponding
symptoms. In the following case symptoms did pre-exist.
A man, six weeks after being bit by a dog, which was killed without
its state of health having been ascertained, was attacked with a sense
of strangling, impossibility of swallowing, delirium, excessive irritability,
glairy vomiting; and he died within twenty-four hours. The
gullet, a little above the diaphragm, was perforated by a hole two-thirds
of an inch in diameter, with thin edges; and effusion had
taken place into the posterior mediastinum.<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c013'><sup>[188]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>13. <i>Perforation of the alimentary canal by worms</i> may here also
be noticed shortly as a disease liable in careless hands to be confounded
with irritant poisoning. This is far from being a common
accident, and very rarely takes place during life. In most of the
cases in which it has been witnessed the symptoms antecedent to
death were those not of irritant, but of narcotic poisoning, and were
then owing simply to the great accumulation of worms in the alimentary
canal. On this subject the reader is referred to the article
Epilepsy in the introductory remarks on the effects of the narcotic
class of poisons. But at times the symptoms have been like those
of irritant poisoning. Thus the following is a case of perforation by
worms during life giving rise to all the phenomena and symptoms of
peritonæal inflammation. A soldier at Mauritius was seized with
slight general fever and severe pain, at first in the pit of the stomach,
and afterwards over the whole belly, which on the third day began
to enlarge. A tendency to suppression of urine and costiveness
ensued, then bilious vomiting; and he died on the fourth day, the
belly having continued to increase to the end. On dissection,
several quarts of muddy fluid were found in the sac of the peritonæum,
the viscera were agglutinated by lymph, a round worm was
discovered among the intestines between the navel and pubes, and
the ileum was perforated six inches from the colon by a hole corresponding
in size with the worm.<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c013'><sup>[189]</sup></a>—A singular case, not however
fatal, but which confirms the fact, that worms may make their way
through the intestines and other textures during life, is mentioned in
Rust’s journal. A woman after a tedious illness first vomited several
lumbrici, and was then seized with a painful swelling in the left side,
which in the process of time suppurated, and discharged along with
the purulent matter three other worms of the same species.<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c013'><sup>[190]</sup></a> Another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>instance of the same kind, where the perforation of the gut succeeded
strangulated hernia, and was followed by the discharge of two lumbrici
and ultimate recovery, is detailed in the Revue Médicale.<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c013'><sup>[191]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Symptoms like those of narcotico-acrid poisoning may be caused
by worms without perforation. A girl, eight years old and in excellent
health, was suddenly seized with violent colic pains, vomiting,
bloody stools, tenderness and swelling of the belly, followed by
convulsions and coma, and proving fatal in seven hours. No other
explanation of the case could be discovered on dissection except the
presence of several hundred ascarides in the intestines and thirteen
in the stomach.<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c013'><sup>[192]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>14. The next diseases to be mentioned are melæna and hæmatemesis,
or purging and vomiting of pure or of altered blood.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is hardly possible to mistake them for poisoning, as the pain
which accompanies them is seldom acute, and the discharge of blood
generally profuse.</p>

<p class='c006'>15. The last are <i>colic</i>, <i>iliac passion</i>, and <i>obstructed intestine</i>. As
the symptoms of some poisons are the same with those of colic, it is
of course sometimes impossible to distinguish the natural disease
from the effects of poison by attending to the abdominal symptoms
only. But the distinction in severe cases of poisoning may almost
always be drawn from collateral symptoms and extraneous circumstances.—The
iliac passion is distinguished by a complete reversion
of the vermicular motion of the intestines in consequence of which
the fæces are often discharged by vomiting. I am not aware that
stercoraceous vomiting is ever caused by poisoning.—A case has
been recorded in Corvisart’s journal, in which iliac passion, originating
in obstruction of the ileum by hardened fæces, and proving fatal
in twenty-six hours, gave rise to a judicial inquiry into the possibility
of poisoning.<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c013'><sup>[193]</sup></a> Another instance, that led to a strong suspicion
of poisoning, has been lately published by M. Rostan, in which
there was continued vomiting and pain of abdomen, proving fatal in
two days, and arising from the small intestines being obstructed by
an adventitious band.<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c013'><sup>[194]</sup></a> In this case the first inspectors failed to observe
the true cause of the symptoms; but Rostan and Orfila, who
were appointed to examine the body a second time, discovered the
constriction, and were unable to find any poison in the stomach by
analysis. Stercoraceous vomiting occurred during life; which might
have been held sufficient to settle the real nature of the case.—Obstruction
of the intestines arising from twisting of the gut, intussusception,
foreign bodies, or strangulated hernia, is easily known by
the seat where the pain begins, by the obstinate constipation, and
also by the excessive enlargement of the belly,—which last, however,
is rather an equivocal symptom.</p>

<p class='c006'>The preceding observations will enable the medical jurist to determine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>how far a diagnosis may be drawn from the symptoms
between poisoning with the irritant and the diseases which resemble
it. It will be remarked that the most embarrassing disease, on
account of its frequency, and peculiar symptoms, is cholera. Cholera,
however, may be recognised in some instances even considered in
regard to the irritants as a class; and we shall presently find that it
may be distinguished still better from the effects of some individual
poisons.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section II.</span>—<i>Of the Morbid Appearances caused by Irritant Poisons, compared with those of certain natural diseases.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The next subject for consideration is the morbid appearances produced
by the irritants as a class, together with those of a similar
nature, which arise from natural causes.</p>

<p class='c006'>The powerful irritants, which are not corrosives, produce simply
the appearances characteristic of inflammation of the alimentary canal
in its various stages,—in the mouth, throat, and gullet vascularity, and
also, if the case has lasted long enough, ulceration;—in the stomach,
vascularity, extravasation of blood under and in the substance of the
villous coat and likewise into the cavity of the organ, abundant
secretion of tough mucus, deposition of coagulable lymph in a fine
network, ulceration of the membranes, occasionally perforation,
preternatural softness of the whole or of part of the villous coat, and
on the other hand sometimes uncommon hardness and shrivelling of
that coat; in the intestines vascularity, extravasation, and ulceration.—Sometimes
several of these appearances are to be seen in the
whole alimentary canal at once. In poisoning with arsenic or corrosive
sublimate it is no unusual thing to meet with redness or ulceration
of the throat, great disease in the stomach, vascularity of the
small intestines, ulcers in the great intestines, and excoriation of the
anus.—When the poison is an active corrosive much more extensive
ravages are sometimes caused, particularly in the stomach.
After poisoning by the mineral acids, for example, the whole mucous
membrane of the stomach is at times found wanting; nay, large
patches of the whole coats may be wanting, and the deficiency supplied
by the adhesion of the margin of the aperture to the adjoining
viscera, and the conversion of the outer membrane of these viscera
into an inner membrane for the stomach.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of the appearances here briefly enumerated the particulars will be
related partly under what is now to be said of the appearances arising
from natural causes, which are liable to be confounded with the
effects of poisons, partly under the head of individual poisons.</p>

<h5 class='c011'><i>Of redness of the stomach and intestines from natural causes, and its distinction from the redness caused by poisons.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>Simple redness of the alimentary mucous membrane in all its
forms, whether of mere vascularity, or actual extravasation, not only
does not distinguish poisoning from inflammatory disorders of natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>origin, but will even seldom distinguish the effects of poison from
those of processes that occur independently of disease, and subsequent
to death. On the subject of real inflammation, as distinguished
from redness originating after death, or pseudo-morbid redness, as it
is commonly termed,—a subject of great consequence to the medical
jurist,—the reader may consult with advantage a paper by Dr.
Yelloly,<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c013'><sup>[195]</sup></a> an essay by MM. Rigot and Trousseau,<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c013'><sup>[196]</sup></a> or that of M. Billard.<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c013'><sup>[197]</sup></a>
The former authors proved by experiment, that various kinds
of pseudo-morbid redness may be formed, which cannot be distinguished
from the parallel varieties caused by inflammation; that these
appearances are formed after death, and not till three, five, or eight
hours after it; that they are to be found chiefly in the most depending
turns of intestines, and in the most depending parts of each turn,
or of the stomach; and that after they have been formed, they may
be made to shift their place, and appear where the membrane was
previously healthy, by simply altering the position of the gut. M.
Billard, on the other hand, has laid down their characters, and made
a minute arrangement of the several kinds. He has divided them
into ramiform, capilliform, punctated, striated, laminated, and diffuse
redness,—terms which need hardly be explained. I must be content
with merely referring to these sources of information for a particular
account of the appearances in question. But it may be right at
the same time to quote an instance of the most aggravated form of
pseudo-morbid redness, in order to convince the reader that all
forms may equally arise from the same causes. Among other example,
then, which have been related of laminated redness, or redness
in patches from extravasation, M. Billard mentions the case
of a man who hanged himself, and in whose body was found, on the
mucous membrane of the small intestine where it lay in the right
flank, “a large, amaranth-red patch, six finger-breadths wide, covered
with bloody exudation, and not removable by washing:” and in
the lower pelvis there was a similar patch of even larger dimensions.<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c013'><sup>[198]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Although morbid and pseudo-morbid redness of the inner coat of
the alimentary canal cannot be distinguished from one another by
any intrinsic character, M. Billard thinks this may be done by attending
to collateral circumstances. According to his researches,
redness is to be accounted inflammatory only when it occurs in parts
not depending in position, or is not limited to such parts: when the
mesenteric veins supplying the parts are not distended, nor the great
abdominal veins obstructed at the time of death; when the reddened
membrane is covered with much mucus, particularly if thick, tenacious,
and adhering; when the mucous membrane itself is opaque,
so that when dissected off and stretched over the finger, the finger is
not visible; when the cellular tissue which connects that membrane
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>with the subjacent coat is brittle, so that the former is easily scratched
off with the nail.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some observations may be here also made on another appearance,
allied to the present group, but which there is strong reason to believe
always indicates some violent irritation at least, if not even
irritation from poison only, in the organ where it is found. It is an
effusion under the villous coat of the stomach, and incorporation
with its substance, of dark brownish-black, or as it were charred,
blood; which is thus altered either by the chemical action of the
poison, or by a vital process. In many cases of poisoning with the
mineral acids, oxalic acid, arsenic, corrosive sublimate, and the like,
there are found on the villous coat of the stomach little knots and
larger irregular patches and streaks, not of a reddish-brown, reddish-black,
or violaceous hue, like pseudo-morbid redness, but dark-grayish-black,
or brownish-black, like the colour of coal or melanosis,—accompanied
too with elevation of the membrane, frequently
with abrasion on the middle of the patches, and surrounded by vascularity.
This conjunction of appearances I have never seen in the
stomach, unless it had been violently irritated; and several experienced
pathologists of my acquaintance agree with me in this statement.
It bears a pretty close resemblance to melanosis of the stomach;<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c013'><sup>[199]</sup></a>
but is distinguished by melanotic blackness being arranged
in regular abruptly-defined spots, and still better by melanosis not
being preceded by symptoms of irritation in the stomach.</p>

<p class='c006'>Referring to what was already said under the head of the symptoms
of gastritis [p. <a href='#Page_102'>102</a>], I must again express my doubts whether
the appearances now described ever arise in this country from natural
disease. In the intestines they are sufficiently familiar to the physician,
as arising from idiopathic enteritis, and from dysentery. But
in the stomach their existence as the effect of natural disease is very
doubtful.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another kind of coloration of the inner membrane of the stomach,
which may be shortly alluded to, because it has actually been mistaken
for the effect of irritation from poison, although by no means
like it,—is staining of the membrane with a reddish, brownish,
yellowish, or greenish tint, observed in bodies that have been kept
some time, and produced by the proximity of the liver, spleen, or
colon if it contains fæces. No unprejudiced and skilful inspector
could possibly mistake this appearance for inflammation. But under
the impulse of prejudice it has been considered such, and imputed
to poison. On the occurrence of such stains an attempt was made
by the French to ascribe to poison the death of the republican general
Hoche. He died rather suddenly on his way from Frankfort to join
his troops; and as poisoning was suspected, the body was opened in
the presence of three French army-surgeons, and a French and two
German physicians. The only appearance of note in the alimentary
canal was two darkish spots on the villous coat of the stomach. The
surgeons drew up a report which imputed his death to poison; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>the physicians refused to sign it; and other medical people who
were subsequently added to the commission decided with the latter.<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c013'><sup>[200]</sup></a>
The surgeons probably would not have been so hasty, if they had not
known that the result of their complaisance would have been the
levying of a heavy fine on the inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c006'>The last kind of discoloration of the inner coat which requires
mention is dyeing from the presence of coloured fluids in the contents.
A remarkable instance has been recorded where redness of this nature
was mistaken for inflammation, and the death of the individual in
consequence ascribed at first to poison. A person long in delicate
health died suddenly after taking a laxative draught; and the stomach,
as well as the gullet, being found on dissection red and livid
in various places, it was hastily inferred by his medical attendants,
that these appearances were the effect of poison, and that the apothecary
had committed some fatal error in compounding the draught.
But another physician, who was acquainted with the deceased, although
he did not attend him professionally, strongly suspected he
had died a natural death; and happening to know he was in the
practice of taking a strong infusion of corn-poppy, inferred that the
supposed signs of inflammation were merely stains arising from the
habitual use of this substance. Accordingly, on making the experiment,
he found that in dogs to which a similar infusion was given,
appearances were produced identically the same.<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c013'><sup>[201]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of the effusion of mucus and lymph from natural causes.</i>—The
abundant secretion of tough mucus in the stomach is a sign of that
organ having been irritated. But the effusion of lymph is more characteristic.
This may be produced by natural inflammation as well
as by irritating poisons. As arising from either cause, however, it
is rare; and certainly by no means so common as would be supposed
from what is said in systematic works; for tough mucus has been
often mistaken for it. Reticulated lymph adhering to the villous
coat, and accompanied with corresponding reticulated redness of
that coat, such as I have seen in animals poisoned with arsenic or
oxalic acid, is an unequivocal sign of inflammation.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of idiopathic ulcers and perforation of the stomach and intestines,
and their distinction from those caused by poison.</i>—Both ulceration
and perforation may be produced by natural disease. In the ulceration
produced by poisons there is generally speaking nothing to distinguish
it from natural ulcers; but that caused by some poisons, such
as iodine, is said to differ by the surrounding coloration of the membrane;
and when the ulcer is caused by a sparingly soluble poison
in a state of powder, such as arsenic, the cavity of the ulcer is sometimes
filled with the powder. Perforation is a rare effect of the simple
irritant poisons; but it is often caused by corrosives. It is imitated
by two of the varieties of perforation from natural disease.</p>

<p class='c006'>The form of natural perforation caused by a common ulcer is precisely
the same as that caused by the simple irritants, and is incapable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>of being distinguished, except when it is attended with
scirrhus.</p>

<p class='c006'>By far the most remarkable variety, however, of spontaneous perforation
is that which takes place, without proper inflammatory action,
from simple gelatinizing of the coats. It is very apt to be mistaken,
and in a celebrated trial, which will be immediately noticed, was
actually mistaken for the effect of corrosive poison.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be situated on any part of the stomach, but is oftenest seen
on the posterior surface. It is sometimes small, more often as big as
a half-crown, frequently of the size of the palm, and occasionally so
great as to involve an entire half of the stomach. Sometimes there
is more than one aperture. The margin is of all shapes, commonly
fringed, and almost always formed of the peritoneum, the other coats
being more extensively dissolved. In one instance, however, the
peritonæal surface was on the contrary the most extensively destroyed;<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c013'><sup>[202]</sup></a>
and in a case which occurred in the infirmary here, and was pointed
out to me by the late Dr. W. Cullen, the peritonæum alone was extensively
softened, and partly dissolved, so as to lay the muscular
coat bare on its outer surface. The gelatinization therefore sometimes,
though very rarely, begins on the outside of the stomach. Internally
the whole is surrounded by pulpiness of the mucous coat,
generally white, occasionally bluish or blackish, never granulated
like an ulcer, very rarely vascular; and when vascular, the blood
may be squeezed out of the loaded and open vessels. The organs in
contact with the hole are also frequently softened. Thus an excavation
is sometimes found in the liver or spleen; or the diaphragm is
pierced through and through. The margins of the latter holes are
without any sign of vascular action, but are generally besmeared
with a dark pulpy mass, the remains of the softened tissue. The
pulp never smells of gangrene; with which, indeed, this species of
softening is wholly unconnected. The edge of the hole in the stomach
never adheres to the adjoining organ; yet, even when the
hole is very large, the contents of the stomach have not always made
their escape. Often the dissolution of the coats is incomplete. John
Hunter and others, indeed, have said that a stomach is rarely seen
without more or less solution of the mucous coat.<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c013'><sup>[203]</sup></a> The best account
of the appearances in this state is given by Jaeger of Stuttgardt.<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c013'><sup>[204]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The circumstances under which this extraordinary appearance occurs
are singularly various. Professor Chaussier and the French pathologists
conceive it to be always a morbid process constituting a
peculiar disease; and doubtless cases have occurred in which death
appears to have arisen from the stomach being perforated during life
by gelatinization.<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c013'><sup>[205]</sup></a> But it has been found much more frequently,
when death was clearly the consequence of a different disease, and
when there did not exist during life a single sign of disorder in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>stomach. Thus it has been found in women who died of convulsions
after delivery,—in children who died convulsed or of hydrocephalus,—after
death from suppuration of the brain, both natural
and the result of violence,—from coma following an old ulcer of the
back, which communicated with the spinal canal,—from diseased
mesenteric glands,—from phthisis,—from nervous fever,—and
after sudden death from fracture of the skull or hanging:<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c013'><sup>[206]</sup></a> and in all
of these circumstances it has occurred without any previous symptom
referrible to a disorder in the stomach.</p>

<p class='c006'>The opinions of pathologists are divided as to its nature. The
French conceive it arises from a morbid corrosive action, which,
however, may extend after death, in consequence of the fluids acquiring
a solvent power. Hunter ascribed it entirely to the solvent
power of the gastric juice after death. There are difficulties in the
way of both doctrines. A full examination of the whole inquiry,
which is one of much interest and considerable complexity, would be
misplaced in this work; but some remarks are called for, by reason
of the important medico-legal relations of the subject, and the uncertainty
in which it is at present involved.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first place, then, it appears difficult, if not impossible, to
comprehend how a vital erosive action can account for the perforations
observed after death from diseases wholly unconnected with the
stomach, and unattended during life by any symptom of disorder in
that organ. For, not to dwell on other less weighty arguments,—on
the one hand, there is during life no symptom of perforation, an
accident which if deep stupor be not present at the same time is
always attended with violent symptoms when it arises from any cause
but gelatinization,—and on the other hand, there is frequently no
escape of the contents of the stomach into the cavity of the abdomen,
though the hole is of enormous size, and its edge not adherent to
the adjoining organs.—All such perforations, however, are perfectly
well accounted for, on the other theory, by what is now known
of the properties of the gastric juice. This will appear from the following
exposition.</p>

<p class='c006'>The power of the gastric juice to dissolve the stomach and other
soft animal textures was long thought to be fully proved by the well-known
researches of Spallanzani,<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c013'><sup>[207]</sup></a> Stevens,<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c013'><sup>[208]</sup></a> and Gosse.<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c013'><sup>[209]</sup></a> In later
times doubts were entertained on the subject in consequence of negative
results having been obtained by other experimentalists, more
especially by Montégre.<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c013'><sup>[210]</sup></a> But these apparently discrepant facts and
opinions have been reconciled by the ulterior experiments of Tiedemann
and Gmelin on digestion;<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c013'><sup>[211]</sup></a> who found that the nature and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>quality of the fluid secreted by the stomach vary much in different
circumstances,—that, when its villous coat is not subjected to some
stimulus, the fluid which lines it is not acid, and does not possess any
particular solvent action,—but that when the membrane is stimulated
by the presence of food or other sources of excitement, the
quality of the secretion is materially changed, for it becomes strongly
acid and is capable of dissolving alimentary substances both in and
out of the body. And still more lately the solvent power of the
proper gastric juice over the stomach, and its capability of producing
perforation in animals after death, have been established in the most
satisfactory manner by Dr. Carswell,<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c013'><sup>[212]</sup></a> who has shown by a series of
incontrovertible facts,—that in the rabbit when killed during the
digestion of a meal, and left for some hours afterwards in particular
positions, all the phenomena of spontaneous gelatinized perforations
observed at times in man, may be easily produced at will,—that
acidity of the gastric juice is an invariable circumstance when such
perforations are remarked,—and that the appearances in question as
they occur in the rabbit are the result of chemical action alone, and occur
only after death. Thus, then, the physiological experiments of Tiedemann
and Gmelin, together with the investigations of Carswell, not
merely establish positively the fact, that the stomach may be perforated
after death by the gastric juice, but likewise account clearly for
the negative results obtained by other experimentalists. For example,
passing over earlier experiments, they explain sufficiently the
negative results obtained by Dr. Pommer of Heilbronn,<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c013'><sup>[213]</sup></a> an experimentalist
of some reputation in Germany; for, falling into the error
of some of the less recent experimentalists on this subject, he made
his observations on animals killed slowly by starving,—in which
circumstance there is no proper gastric juice in the stomach, and consequently
no solvent action can exist.</p>

<p class='c006'>These statements relative to the causes and phenomena of gelatinized
perforation in the stomach supply the strongest possible presumption
which analogy can furnish, that a great proportion of spontaneous
gelatinized perforations in the human subject are owing to the action
of the gastric juice after death. And this presumption is increased
to something not far removed from demonstration by the circumstance,
that in man the process of softening has actually been traced extending
in the dead body. This interesting fact was first noticed by Mr.
Allan Burns.<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c013'><sup>[214]</sup></a> In the body of a girl who died of diseased mesenteric
glands he found an aperture in the fore part of the stomach with
the usual pulpy margin, and the liver in contact with the hole uninjured.
In two days more the liver opposite the hole had become
pulpy, and its peritonæal coat quite dissolved; and the back part of
the stomach opposite the hole was also dissolved, so that only its peritonæal
coat remained. Dr. Sharpey has communicated to me a
similar observation. On finding in the body of a child the stomach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>perforated and gelatinized, but the adjoining organs uninjured, he
sewed up the body, to show the appearances to some of his friends
next day. By that time the peritonæal surfaces of the spleen and
left kidney were found much softened and pulpy where they lay in
contact with the hole in the stomach. I have since met with a
similar occurrence where the perforation affected the duodenum
(p. <a href='#Page_120'>120</a>).</p>

<p class='c006'>It must be admitted, then, that the action of the gastric juice after
death is quite sufficient to account for the greater number of gelatiniform
perforations in the human stomach.</p>

<p class='c006'>But in the second place, it seems scarcely possible to explain every
perforation of the kind in this way. The solvent action of the gastric
juice for example, affords no explanation of a singular case related
by M. Récamier,<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c013'><sup>[215]</sup></a> where, after death in the secondary stage of
small-pox, the stomach was transparent and brittle, and perforated in
the splenic region by a gelatinized hole large enough to admit the
fist,—although the fluid in the stomach was subsequently found incapable
of dissolving another stomach, and almost destitute of free
acid. And still less will the solvent action of the gastric juice account
for such cases as those of Laisné and Gastellier, quoted in pp.
<a href='#Page_107'>107</a>–8, or the French medico-legal case to be mentioned in p. <a href='#Page_118'>118</a>,—where
death is preceded by a short illness, indicating a violent disorder
of the stomach, and sometimes even characterized by all the
marked symptoms of perforation. In the last description of cases,
which are comparatively very rare, it seems necessary to admit that
the gelatinization takes place during life; unless, indeed, it be supposed
that the stomach is first perforated during life by ordinary ulcerative
absorption, and then gelatinized after death, in consequence
of the irritation existing before death having given rise to an unusual
secretion of gastric juice.</p>

<p class='c006'>Passing now to the differences between these gelatinized perforations,
and the perforations caused by corrosive poisons, it may in the
first instance be observed, that the margin of a corroded aperture is
sometimes of a peculiar colour,—for example, yellow with nitric
acid, brown with sulphuric acid or the alkalis, orange with iodine.
But a much better, perhaps indeed an infallible criterion, and one of
universal application, is the following. Either the person dies very
soon after the poison is introduced, in which case vital action may
not be excited in the stomach: or he lives long enough for the ordinary
consequences of violent irritation to ensue. In the former case,
as a large quantity of poison must have been taken, and much vomiting
cannot have occurred, part of the poison will be found in the
stomach: In the latter case, the poison may have been all ejected;
but in consequence of the longer duration of life, deep vascularity,
or black extravasation must be produced round the hole, and sometimes
too in other parts of the stomach; changes which will at once
distinguish the appearance from a gelatinized aperture. There is no
doubt that the stomach may be perforated by the strong corrosives,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>and yet hardly any of the poison be found in the stomach after death.
Thus in a case related by Mertzdorff of poisoning with sulphuric acid,
where life was prolonged for twelve hours, he could detect by minute
analysis only 4½ grains of the acid in the contents and tissue of
the stomach. But then the hole was surrounded by signs of vital
reaction, and so was the spleen upon which the aperture opened.<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c013'><sup>[216]</sup></a>
Judging from what I have often seen in animals killed with oxalic
acid, which is the most rapidly fatal of all corrosives, so that little
time is allowed for vital action, and also several times in persons
who had died quickly from the action of sulphuric acid, I believe no
poison can dissolve the stomach, without such unequivocal signs of
violent irritation of the undissolved parts of the villous coat, as will
secure an attentive observer from the mistake of confounding with
these appearances the effects of spontaneous erosion. Spontaneous
erosion is very generally united with unusual whiteness of the stomach,
and there is never any material vascularity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Resting on the description now given of the spontaneous and poisonous
varieties of corrosion, it is an easy matter to decide a controversy,
which at the time it occurred made a great deal of noise, and
upon which the opinions of toxicologists have been unnecessarily
divided. It is the question regarding death by poison which occurred
in the trial of Mr. Angus at Liverpool in 1808 for the murder
of his housekeeper Miss Burns. The poison suspected was corrosive
sublimate. The symptoms were those of irritation in the alimentary
canal,—vomiting, purging, and pain. In the dead body there was
not any particular redness either of the intestines or of the stomach.
But on the fore part of the stomach an aperture was found between
the size of a crown piece and the palm of the hand; it had a ragged,
pulpy margin; and the dissolution of the inner coat extended two
inches from it all round the hole. No mention is made of adhesion
or coloration of the margin. This description, it will be remarked,
answers exactly that given above of spontaneous gelatinized perforation;
and the absence of the signs of vital action around the hole and
in the rest of the stomach is incompatible with the effects of a strong
corrosive poison, unless death had occurred very soon after it was
swallowed. This, however, was out of the question; for then the
poison would have been found in the stomach,—which it was not.<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c013'><sup>[217]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The case of Angus is not the only instance in recent times of spontaneous
perforation having given rise to an opinion by medical men
in favour of poisoning, and consequently to a criminal trial. Six
years afterwards a similar incident occurred in France. A young
woman near Montargis having died of a short illness, and a large
erosion having been found in the stomach after death, six practitioners,
on a view of the parts, and without referring to the antecedent
symptoms or attempting an analysis of the contents of the stomach,
declared that she died of the effects of some corrosive poison. The
husband and mother-in-law, against whom there does not appear to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>have been a shadow of general evidence, were therefore imprisoned
and subsequently tried for their lives. Luckily, however, an intelligent
physician of the town saw the error of the reporters, and after
vainly endeavouring to persuade them to revise their opinion, was
the means of the case being remitted to the medical faculty of Paris.
That distinguished body, with Professor Chaussier at its head, gave
a unanimous and decided opinion, not only that there was not any
proof of poisoning, but likewise that the woman could have died of
nothing else than spontaneous perforation. The leading features of
the medical evidence will at once show how indefensible the conduct
and opinion of the original reporters were. The last meal taken
by the woman before she became ill, and the only one at which poison
could have been administered by the prisoners, was her supper;
her illness did not begin till past six next morning; the symptoms
were mortal coldness, fainting, general pains, headache, pain in the
stomach, purging and colic, without vomiting, and she died after
twenty-four hours’ illness; the morbid appearances were general redness
of the stomach, softening and pulpy destruction of a third part
of its posterior parietes, and nevertheless the presence in the stomach
of a pint and a half of fluid matter, containing evidently the remains
of soup taken by the woman after she felt unwell. On the decision
of the Parisian faculty the prisoners were discharged; and the original
reporters were deservedly handled with great severity in several
publications that appeared not long after.<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c013'><sup>[218]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of perforations of the Gullet and Intestines from natural causes,
and their distinctions from those produced by poisons.</i>—The intestines,
and sometimes even the gullet, may be perforated by the same erosive
or solvent process as the stomach. Thus Mr. Allan Burns observes,
that in four plump children, whose previous history he could not
learn, he found every part of the alimentary canal, from the termination
of the gullet down to the beginning of the rectum, reduced to a
gluey, transparent pulp, like thick starch. The bodies were quite
free from putrefaction; but the abdomen exhaled a very sour smell
when opened. No other organic derangement could be detected.<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c013'><sup>[219]</sup></a>
The particulars of a similar case, with an account of the symptoms,
have been lately published by Mr. Smith, a London surgeon. In the
body of a child who died of protracted diarrhœa subsequent to weaning,
the whole intestines, from the duodenum to the sigmoid flexure
of the colon, were found fourteen hours after death gelatinous, semitransparent,
and so soft and brittle that they could not bear their own
weight, but tore when lifted between the fingers. The stomach and
rectum were healthy.<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c013'><sup>[220]</sup></a> I lately met with the following instance,
where the erosion clearly took place after death. In the body of a
girl who died within twelve hours of poisoning with red-precipitate,
the stomach and duodenum were found much inflamed, but quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>entire and firm three days after death. Eighteen days afterwards,
when I had an opportunity of examining these organs, their textures
remained firm everywhere, except a few inches below the pylorus,
where I found two apertures in the duodenum, each as big as a crown,
and surrounded by extensive jelly-like softening.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following case from Laisné’s treatise shows that the gullet
may be also dissolved in the same way. A woman three days after
delivery was attacked with puerperal peritonitis, and died in four
days. In the belly were found the usual morbid appearances of
peritonitis: but in addition there was in the lower part of the gullet
a large oval aperture two inches long, which penetrated through the
posterior mediastinum into the lungs.<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c013'><sup>[221]</sup></a> Another singular instance of
the same kind has already been mentioned under the head of the symptoms
(see p. <a href='#Page_107'>107</a>). Another has been described by Dr. Marshall
Hall. In a child who died of bronchitis, an opening was found in
the gullet about the size of a pea, so that the canal of the gullet
communicated with the sac of the pleura; and several veins
appeared also to have been opened.<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c013'><sup>[222]</sup></a> The stomach was likewise
perforated.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not difficult to draw the distinction between these perforations
and the effects of poison. The throat and gullet may be partially
disorganized or corroded by the strong corrosives; but they are very
rarely penetrated, since the greater part of the poison must pass into
the stomach or be rejected by vomiting. Destruction of the mucous
coat is a common consequence, and stricture occasionally follows;
but I have hitherto met with only one instance among the innumerable
published cases of poisoning with the mineral acids, alkalis, and other
corrosives, where the gullet was perforated. In that case the perforation
was the result of slow ulceration from poisoning with sulphuric
acid, where life was prolonged for two months.<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c013'><sup>[223]</sup></a> Perforation from
simple corrosion never occurs. The intestines are never perforated
by chemical corrosion from within, for either the poison is in a great
measure expelled from the stomach by vomiting, or the pylorus contracts
and prevents the passage of every poison that is sufficiently
concentrated to corrode. Both the small and great intestines might
be corroded from without, in consequence of the poison escaping
through a hole in the stomach. I am not acquainted, however,
with any case of the kind where, intestinal perforation has occurred.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the intestines are pierced by true ulceration, it is impossible
to tell whether it arose from natural disease or an irritant
poison.</p>

<p class='c006'>The mode of forming a diagnosis between the symptoms and
appearances of irritant poisoning and those of natural disease
being thus explained, the different species of poisons which have
been arranged in the class of irritants will now be considered in their
order.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>The irritant class of poisons may be divided into five orders: the
acids and their bases; the alkalies and their salts; the metallic compounds;
the vegetable and animal irritants; the mechanical irritants.
In a short appendix some substances will be mentioned which are not
usually considered poisonous, but are capable of causing violent symptoms
when taken in large doses.</p>

<p class='c006'>The greater number of poisons included in the first order have a
very powerful local action. Most of them possess true corrosive properties
when they are sufficiently concentrated. Most of them likewise
act remotely. One of them, oxalic acid, is evidently not so much
an irritant as a narcotico-acrid; but since its most frequent action as
seen in man is irritation, it seems inexpedient to break the natural
arrangement for the sake of logical accuracy. This is far from being
the only instance where the toxicologist is compelled to violate the
principles of philosophical classification.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the present Order are included four of the mineral acids, the
sulphuric, nitric, muriatic and phosphoric, with their bases, phosphorus,
sulphur, and chlorine: To these may be added iodine and bromine,
with their compounds, and also oxalic and acetic acid, two of
the vegetable acids.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING WITH THE MINERAL ACIDS.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>Of the mineral acids, the most important, because the most
common, are <i>sulphuric</i>, <i>hydrochloric</i>, and <i>nitric</i> acids. They
are remarkably similar in their effects on the animal economy.
Phosphoric acid is of much less consequence, and will be noticed
cursorily.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sulphuric acid (<i>vitriolic acid</i>, <i>vitriol</i>—<i>oil of vitriol</i>), hydrochloric
acid (<i>muriatic acid</i>,—<i>spirit of salt</i>) and nitric acid (<i>aqua-fortis</i>),
have been long known to be possessed of very energetic properties;
and consequently cases of poisoning with them have often been observed.
The instances of the kind hitherto published have been
chiefly the result of suicide; a considerable number have originated
in accident; and, however extraordinary it may appear, a few have
been cases of murder. Tartra, in an excellent memoir on the subject
of poisoning with nitric acid, quotes an instance of a woman having
been poisoned while in a state of intoxication by that acid being
mixed with wine and poured down her throat.<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c013'><sup>[224]</sup></a> Valentini has related
the case of a woman who was killed by frequent doses of sulphuric
acid given under the pretence of administering medicines.<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c013'><sup>[225]</sup></a> In
1829 an hospital servant was condemned at Strasbourg for trying to
murder his wife in like manner, by first making her ill with tartar-emetic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>and then giving her sulphuric acid in syrup, under the pretence
of curing her.<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c013'><sup>[226]</sup></a> At the Aberdeen autumn circuit in 1830 a
woman Humphrey was convicted of murdering her husband by pouring
the same acid down his throat while he lay asleep with his mouth
open.<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c013'><sup>[227]</sup></a> On the whole, considering the powerful taste and excessively
acrid properties of these poisons, it is probable that they will seldom
be resorted to for the purpose of making away with another person,
who is an adult, and in a state of consciousness. Of late, however,
there have been several instances in our country of murder committed
on infants in this barbarous manner. A woman Malcolm was executed
here in 1808 for murdering her own child, an infant of eighteen
months, by pouring sulphuric acid down its throat;<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c013'><sup>[228]</sup></a> another woman
Clark was tried for the same crime at Exeter in 1822; a man was executed
lately at Manchester for murdering in the same way his son, a
child four years and a half old;<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c013'><sup>[229]</sup></a> and the particulars of an interesting
trial will be presently noticed, that of Overfield, who was executed
at Shrewsbury in 1824, for poisoning his child in the like manner.<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c013'><sup>[230]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In a medico-legal point of view, the mineral acids are interesting
on another account. Of late a new crime has arisen in Britain, the
disfiguring of the countenance by squirting oil of vitriol on it. It
originated in Glasgow, during the quarrels in 1820, between masters
and workmen regarding the rate of wages,<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c013'><sup>[231]</sup></a> and became at last so
frequent, that the Lord Advocate, in applying for an act of Parliament
to extend the English Stabbing and Maiming act to Scotland,
added a clause which renders the offence now alluded to capital.
In 1828 a woman Macmillan was tried here and condemned under
that act.<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c013'><sup>[232]</sup></a> The crime afterwards became common in England.
Three cases were noticed in the newspapers as having occurred in
London, in November, 1828; and two others near Manchester in
the spring of 1829. It is now much less frequent.</p>

<p class='c006'>The mineral acids are also very interesting on scientific grounds.
They afford the purest examples of true corrosive poisons, their poisonous
effects depending entirely on the organic injury they occasion
in the textures to which they are applied. It is of use to set out, in
investigating the effects of poisons, by determining the phenomena
presented under such circumstances. When made aware of the rapidity
with which other irritating poisons prove fatal, and the slight
signs they commonly leave of their operation, one cannot fail to be
struck with discovering what the animal frame will sometimes endure
from these the most violent of all irritants, and nevertheless
recover.</p>

<p class='c006'>In laying down the mode of determining by chemical evidence a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>case of supposed poisoning with any of the three mineral acids mentioned
above, it will be unnecessary to notice any of their chemical
properties, except those from which their medico-legal tests are derived.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only common properties that require notice are, their power
of reddening the vegetable blue colours, for showing which litmus-paper
is commonly used, and is most convenient: and their power
of staining and corroding all articles of dress, especially such as are
made of wool, hair, and leather. This last property is specified,
though a familiar one, because it always forms important evidence in
criminal cases. In order to give precision to such evidence, it is necessary
to remember, that if the article of dress is a coloured one, it
is generally rendered red by the mineral acids; but that the vegetable
acids also will redden most articles of dress, although they do not
corrode them.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>I.—<span class='sc'>Of Poisoning with Sulphuric Acid.</span></h4>

<p class='c012'>Sulphuric acid is extensively employed in very many trades, is
used even for some domestic purposes, and is consequently familiar
to every one. Hence it is the mineral acid which has been most
commonly used as a poison, especially for committing suicide. Of
35 cases of poisoning with the mineral acids which occurred in
England in the years 1837 and 1838, 32 were caused by this acid
(p. <a href='#Page_90'>90</a>).</p>

<h5 class='c011'><span class='sc'>Section I.</span>—<i>Of the Tests for Sulphuric Acid.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>Sulphuric acid is known as a poison chiefly in the form of the
concentrated commercial acid. But a few cases of poisoning have
also been produced by blue-liquor or the solution of indigo in strong
sulphuric acid; and one instance<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c013'><sup>[233]</sup></a> has been recorded of poisoning
with the aromatic sulphuric acid of the Pharmacopœias, which is an
infusion of aromatics in a mixture of sulphuric acid, ether and alcohol.
In the following remarks on its tests, it will be sufficient to
consider it <i>first</i> in the concentrated form,—<i>secondly</i>, in a state of
simple dilution,—and <i>thirdly</i>, when mixed with various impurities,
more especially with vegetable and animal matter. The acid solution
of indigo may be known by the tests for the concentrated acid,
and its blue colour, removable by a solution of chlorine; and the
aromatic sulphuric acid may be distinguished by its odour and the
tests for the diluted acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <i>When concentrated</i> it is oily-looking, colourless, or brownish
from having acted on organic particles, without odour, much heavier
than water, and capable of quickly corroding animal substances. If
from these properties, and its effect in reddening litmus, its exact
nature be not considered obvious, it may be heated with a few chips
of copper; when sulphurous acid is disengaged and may be readily
recognised by its odour.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>2. <i>When diluted</i>, it may be distinguished from all ordinary acids
by solution of nitrate of baryta occasioning a heavy white precipitate
of sulphate of baryta, which is insoluble in nitric acid. Selenic
and sulphurous acids, however, and also, as Mr. Alfred Taylor informs
me he has lately found, the fluo-silicic acid, are similarly acted
on in all respects. But selenic and fluo-silicic acids in all forms, and
sulphurous acid in a state of solution, are so seldom met with, being
known only in the laboratory of the scientific chemist, that they can
scarcely be considered sources of fallacy. Sulphuric acid may at
once be distinguished from sulphurous acid, by the latter possessing
a peculiar pungent odour. From the two other acids it may be distinguished
by collecting and drying the barytic precipitate, mixing
this with charcoal, converting it into sulphuret of barium by heating
it in a platinum spoon before the blowpipe, and then adding diluted
muriatic acid to the sulphuret, so as to disengage sulphuretted hydrogen gas,—which
again is easily known by its odour, or its property
of blackening paper dipped in solution of acetate of lead. A
much more important source of fallacy than these is the possible presence
of a bisulphate in solution, or a neutral sulphate along with any
other free acid; for these substances will present the same reactions
with litmus and barytic salts as free sulphuric acid itself. Much has
been published lately upon this point; but the difficulty has not yet
been satisfactorily overcome. It may be got rid of indeed by proving,
that no bisulphate or neutral sulphate is present. Their absence
may be shown by no solid residuum being left on evaporating
the suspected fluid, or at least no more than a mere haziness, owing
to the sulphate of lead which commercial sulphuric acid always contains
in small quantity. Or as Orfila suggests, we may establish
their absence still better by concentrating the fluid, and finding that
neither carbonate of soda, which would cause a precipitate with
earthy or metallic bases, nor chloride of platinum, which would do
so with potash or ammonia in combination, nor fluo-silicic acid,
which precipitates soda salts, has any effect when applied to separate
portions of the subject of inquiry. But suppose it appears in the
course of these trials that one or more bases are actually present,
how is it to be settled whether the sulphuric acid, indicated by litmus
and a salt of baryta, is really free or not? To this question I must
reply, that no method has yet been proposed, which is at once satisfactory
and easily available. Mr. Alfred Taylor proposes to concentrate
the fluid, and agitate it with alcohol, in the hope that the alcohol
will remove sulphuric acid, and not a sulphate, from the water.<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c013'><sup>[234]</sup></a>
But it removes sulphuric acid from a bisulphate even when dry, and
still more when a little water is present. Orfila<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c013'><sup>[235]</sup></a> proposes, in the
case of sulphuric acid in vinegar,—where there is both a vegetable
acid and a neutral sulphate of lime,—to concentrate to a sixth, and
agitate the residuum with four times its volume of sulphuric ether, in
the expectation that this fluid will remove the free acid alone, and
separate it from sulphates. But notwithstanding the authority of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>name for the fact, pure ether will not remove sulphuric acid from a
watery fluid; and etherized alcohol, which does remove it, takes it
away also, like alcohol itself, from bisulphates. These results I have
observed in some careful trials made along with Dr. Douglas Maclagan.
I suspect, therefore, that where sulphates or bisulphates do
exist, there is no absolutely satisfactory way of determining whether
free sulphuric acid also co-exists, except by a quantitative analysis,
for ascertaining whether the amount of acid and of bases corresponds
with this supposition or not. And it is scarcely necessary to add,
that so operose a method is scarcely applicable to ordinary medico-legal
investigations.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. It is seldom that the medical jurist is called on to search for
sulphuric acid in either of the states already mentioned. Much more
generally it has mingled with and acted on various organic substances.
The circumstances in which it has usually to be sought
for in the practice of medical jurisprudence are twofold,—on the
one hand, in stains on clothes,—and on the other, in vomited matter,
the contents of the stomach, or organic mixtures generally.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Process for analyzing stains on clothes.</i>—When sulphuric acid is
thrown upon your clothes, it produces a permanent red, reddish-brown,
or yellowish stain, destroys the cloth entirely or renders it
brittle, and in consequence of its strong attraction for water keeps the
stain long in a moist state. In the course of the decomposition of
the cloth a part of the acid is itself decomposed, sulphurous acid being
disengaged. But it is an important medico-legal fact, that after a
time the change either goes on very slowly, or is arrested altogether,
possibly by the dilution of the acid with moisture from the atmosphere;
and that consequently it may be discovered in a free state
in stains after a much longer interval than would <i>à priori</i> be expected.
In the case of Macmillan formerly alluded to, Dr. Turner and I, who
were employed by the crown to examine the different injured articles
of dress, found on a man’s hat, stock, shirt-collar and coat many discoloured
and corroded spots, which were sour to the taste fourteen days
after the crime was committed; in the subsequent case of Mrs. Humphrey
I discovered six-tenths of a grain of free sulphuric acid in two
small spots on a blanket seven weeks after the crime; and from an
express experiment on the same blanket with two drops of acid of
known strength, it appeared that only one-half of the acid disappeared
in seven weeks. It may therefore be inferred, that, in every instance
where stains have been produced by concentrated sulphuric acid on
clothes, at least on woollen clothes, and no attempt has been made to
remove the remaining acid by washing or neutralization, a sufficient
quantity will be present even after several weeks to admit of being
satisfactorily detected by chemical analysis.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following are the steps of the process which appear to me the
most delicate and equivocal. Cut away the stained spots; boil them
for a minute or two in several successive small portions of distilled
water; and filter if necessary. Next prove the acidity of the fluid by
litmus, and likewise by the taste if the quantity of solution is large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>enough to allow of so coarse a test being used; and with a few drops
ascertain the existence of sulphuric acid in one form or another by
nitrate of baryta and nitric acid, as mentioned in the process for the
pure diluted acid. If no precipitate appears, the search for sulphuric
acid is at an end. But if a precipitate is produced, ascertain the absence
of bisulphates and sulphates by proving the absence of bases,
according to the method described in the process for the simple diluted
acid. If, however, bases be found in material proportion to
the acid, the analysis is subject to all the difficulties mentioned above
in speaking of the detection of the diluted acid in similar circumstances.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Process for the contents of the stomach and other complex mixtures.</i>—When
sulphuric acid has been mixed with various mineral and organic
substances, it may in no long time cease to exist in the free
state. Part may be decomposed by organic matter in the way formerly
mentioned. Or the whole may be neutralized at once by earthy
or alkaline carbonates, administered purposely as antidotes. Or it
may also be neutralized more slowly by the gradual development of
ammonia in consequence of the decay of the animal matter co-existing
in the mixture. Thus in a case mentioned by Mertzdorff of a
child killed in twelve hours with sulphuric acid, the contents of the
stomach did not redden litmus, but on the contrary had an ammoniacal
odour; and they contained a considerable quantity of a soluble
sulphate, probably the sulphate of ammonia.<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c013'><sup>[236]</sup></a> In like manner MM.
Orfila and Lesueur found that when this acid was left some months in
a mixture which contained putrefying azotized matter, it was gradually
neutralized by ammonia.<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c013'><sup>[237]</sup></a> It appears from Orfila’s latest researches,<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c013'><sup>[238]</sup></a>
that in most cases of acute poisoning with this substance
some free acid will be found in the contents or tissues of the
stomach, provided alkalis or earths were not given as antidotes, and
the examination of the body be made before decay sets in.</p>

<p class='c006'>The detection of sulphuric acid in complex organic mixtures, simple
though it appears at first sight, is one of the most difficult problems
in medico-legal chemistry. The difficulty arises from a variety of
sources,—from the probable presence of neutral sulphates along
with free hydrochloric, acetic, or some other acid,—the possible
presence of a bisulphate,—the occasional neutralization of the sulphuric
acid by antidotes given during life, or ammonia evolved during
decay after death,—or its neutralization, together with the development
of a different free acid, by its having displaced this acid from a
salt existing in the mixture.</p>

<p class='c006'>The subject was investigated in most of its relations in the last
edition of the present work, and a process proposed which overcame
some difficulties, but left others untouched. The inquiry has been
since undertaken also by M. Devergie and Professor Orfila, but with
most success in Germany by Dr. Simon.<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c013'><sup>[239]</sup></a> The result of all these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>researches is, that a satisfactory process for detecting sulphuric acid
in organic mixtures still remains to be discovered. Meanwhile the
most eligible method appears to me to be the following.</p>

<p class='c006'>a. <i>If the mixture be acid</i>, add distilled water, if necessary, boil,
filter, and test a few drops of the fluid with nitrate of baryta, followed
by nitric acid. If there be no precipitate, the search for sulphuric
acid is at an end. If a precipitate form, distil the fluid from
a muriate of lime or oil bath, at a temperature not above 240°, till the
residuum acquire a thick syrupy consistence; and preserve apart the
last sixth of the distilled liquor. In this liquor test for hydrochloric
acid by litmus-paper and nitrate of silver, and for acetic acid by
litmus-paper, and the odour and taste of the liquid. If these acids
be not in the distilled fluid, they are not in the residuum. In a
portion of this residuum search for nitric acid, and in another portion
for oxalic acid, by the processes for these poisons in complex mixtures.
If all these acids be thus proved to be absent, it is most unlikely that
the acidity of the mixture is owing to any other but sulphuric acid,
especially in the case of the contents or textures of the stomach.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dilute now what remains of the syrupy extract, and add nitrate of
baryta with nitric acid. If a precipitate arise, there is a strong presumption
that the acidity of the mixture was owing either to a bisulphate
or to free sulphuric acid. And between these the question
may be almost settled, first by the probability or improbability of a
bisulphate having come in the way, and secondly, by the symptoms
and morbid appearances. The result however cannot justify more
than a presumptive opinion.—But if hydrochloric, acetic or nitric
acid be indicated in the subject of analysis, or an acid sulphate, the
whole process is vitiated, and it is scarcely possible to arrive at any
trustworthy conclusion.</p>

<p class='c006'>The difficulties adverted to above have been made the ground-work
of various processes; which however seem to me all imperfect.—It
has been proposed to divide the mixture into two equal parts,
to precipitate one directly by a barytic salt, to do the same with the
other after drying and incinerating it, to compare the weight of the
precipitates, and to infer the presence of free sulphuric acid if the
former is more than double the latter. Various objections however
may be brought against this check, not the least serious being its
difficulty in ordinary hands, whenever the precipitates are none of
them considerable.—Simon proposes to exhaust the residuum of
evaporation with absolute alcohol, in the hope that free sulphuric acid
will alone be taken up;<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c013'><sup>[240]</sup></a> but he himself found that neutral sulphates
are dissolved partially; and besides, alcohol removes sulphuric acid
from bisulphates.—Orfila proposes to remove free sulphuric acid by
agitating the concentrated liquor with sulphuric ether, and separating
and evaporating off the ether; for he holds that all neutral and acid
salts of sulphuric acid are insoluble in ether.<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c013'><sup>[241]</sup></a> This proposal is unaccountable.
Simon stated in his paper three years before, that ether
does not remove sulphuric acid from watery fluids containing it.
And Dr. Douglas Maclagan and I, on inquiring into the matter, found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>that we could not, by means of ether, separate a particle of sulphuric
acid from an ounce of rice soup and mucilage to which ten drops of
the acid had been added. The process of Orfila for establishing the
absence of bases in a simple watery solution is applicable to organic
mixtures also, after incineration. But if bases be present in material
quantity, all the difficulties now in question remain in full force.</p>

<p class='c006'>b. <i>When the mixture is neutral</i>, sulphuric acid may be detected in
it by the first steps of the preceding process. But the inference,
that it once existed free can only be drawn when the subject of examination
is not in a state of decay, when the quantity of sulphate of
baryta obtained is considerable, when the administration of an antidote
is proved, and when the ashes after incineration contain the
antacid base which is said to have been administered. Even then
the inference is only presumptive.</p>

<h5 class='c011'><span class='sc'>Section II.</span>—<i>Of the Mode of Action of Sulphuric Acid, and the Symptoms caused by it in Man.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>It was formerly observed that the action of the strong mineral
acids is independent of the function of absorption. They act by
the conveyance along the nerves of an impression produced by the
irritation or destruction of the part to which they are applied. There
is very little difference between the three acids in the symptoms they
excite or the action they exert.</p>

<p class='c006'>When sulphuric acid is introduced directly into a vein it causes
death by coagulating the blood. Thus, when Professor Orfila injected
in the jugular vein of a dog half a drachm diluted with an
equal weight of water, he observed that the animal at once struggled
violently, stretched out its limbs, and expired; and on opening
the chest immediately, he found the heart and great vessels filled
with coagulated blood.<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c013'><sup>[242]</sup></a>—Nitric acid and hydrochloric acid act in
the same way.</p>

<p class='c006'>If, on the other hand, they are introduced into the stomach, the
blood as usual remains fluid for some time after death; the symptoms
are referrible almost solely to the abdomen; and in the dead
body the stomach is found extensively disorganised, and the other
abdominal viscera sometimes inflamed. If the dose be large, and
the animal fasting, death may take place in so short a time as three
hours: but in general it lives much longer.<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c013'><sup>[243]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>When the strong mineral acids are applied outwardly, they irritate,
inflame, or corrode the skin. The most rapid in producing
these effects is the nitric, or rather the nitrous acid. The strong,
fuming nitrous acid even causes effervescence when dropped on the
skin.</p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila has proved that sulphuric acid, as well as the two other
mineral acids, is absorbed; for they may be detected in the urine,
when they are introduced either into the stomach or through a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>wound.<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c013'><sup>[244]</sup></a> He could not succeed, however, in detecting any of them
in the liver or spleen; in which organs it will be seen, hereafter,
that various other poisons may be discovered by chemical analysis.
But Mr. Scoffern seems to have found sulphuric acid in the kidney,
even although the individual survived the taking of the poison
nearly two days.<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c013'><sup>[245]</sup></a> It is also worthy of remark, that, as will be
proved presently, these acids may pass through the coats of the
stomach by transudation, and so be found on the surface of the
other organs in the belly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Toxicology is indebted to M. Tartra for the first methodic information
published respecting the symptoms caused in man by sulphuric
acid and the other mineral acids:<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c013'><sup>[246]</sup></a> but many important
additional facts have been made known by numberless cases of poisoning
which have since appeared, chiefly in the periodic journals.</p>

<p class='c006'>The symptoms caused by all the three acids are so nearly the same,
that after a detailed account of those occasioned by sulphuric acid, it
will not be necessary to add much on the subject under the head of
nitric and muriatic acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>M. Tartra considers that four varieties may be observed in the
effects of the mineral acids. 1. Speedy death from violent corrosion and
inflammation; 2. Slow death from a peculiar organic disease of the
stomach and intestines; 3. Imperfect recovery, the person remaining
liable ever after to irritability of the stomach; 4. Perfect recovery.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. The most ordinary symptoms are those of the first variety,—namely,
all the symptoms that characterise the most violent gastritis,
accompanied likewise with burning in the throat, which is
increased by pressure, swallowing, or coughing;<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c013'><sup>[247]</sup></a>—eructations proceeding
from the gases evolved in the stomach by its chemical decomposition;—and
an excruciating pain in the stomach, such as
no natural inflammation can excite. The lips are commonly
shrivelled, at first whitish, but afterwards brownish in the case of
sulphuric acid. Occasionally there are also excoriations, more rarely
little blisters. Similar marks appear on other parts of the skin
with which the acid may have come in contact, such as the cheeks,
neck, breast, or fingers; and these marks undergo the same change
of colour as the marks on the lips. I had an opportunity of witnessing
this in the case of the man who was disfigured by the Macmillans
(p. <a href='#Page_122'>122</a>) with sulphuric acid. He was cruelly burnt on the
face as well as on the hands, which he had raised to protect his
face; and the marks were at first white, but in sixteen hours
became brownish. The inside of the mouth is also generally
shrivelled, white, and often more or less corroded; and as the poisoning
advances, the teeth become loose and yellowish-brown about
the coronæ. The teeth sometimes become brown in so short a
time as three hours.<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c013'><sup>[248]</sup></a> Occasionally the tongue, gums, and inside
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>of the cheeks are white, and as it were polished, like ivory.<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c013'><sup>[249]</sup></a> There
is almost always great difficulty, and sometimes complete impossibility,
of swallowing. In the case of a child related by Dr. Sinclair,
of Manchester, fluids taken by the mouth were returned by
the nose; and the reason was obvious after death; for even then
the pharynx was so much contracted as to admit a probe with difficulty.<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c013'><sup>[250]</sup></a>
On the same account substances taken by the mouth have
been discharged by an opening in the larynx which had been made
to relieve impending suffocation. The matter vomited, if no fluids
be swallowed, is generally brownish or black, and at first causes
effervescence, if it falls on a pavement containing any lime. Afterwards
this matter is mixed with shreds of membrane, which resemble
the coats of the stomach, and sometimes actually consists of
the disorganised coats, but are generally nothing more than coagulated
mucus. The bowels are obstinately costive, the urine scanty
or suppressed; and the patient is frequently harassed by distressing
tenesmus and desire to pass water. The pulse all along is very
weak, sometimes intermitting, and towards the close imperceptible.
It is not always frequent; on the contrary, it has been observed
of natural frequency, small and feeble in a patient who survived
fifteen days.<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c013'><sup>[251]</sup></a> The countenance becomes at an early period glazed
and ghastly, and the extremities cold and clammy. The breathing
is often laborious, owing to the movements of the chest increasing
the pain in the stomach,—or because pulmonary inflammation is
also at times present,—or because the admission of air into the
lungs is impeded by the injury done to the epiglottis and entrance
of the larynx. To these symptoms are added occasional fits of
suffocation from shreds of thick mucus sticking in the throat, and
sometimes croupy respiration, with sense of impending choking.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such is the ordinary train of symptoms in cases of the first
variety. But sometimes, especially when a large dose has been
swallowed, instead of these excruciating tortures, there is a deceitful
tranquillity and absence of all uneasiness. Thus, in the case of
a woman who was poisoned by her companions making her swallow
while intoxicated aqua-fortis mixed with wine, although she had
at first a good deal of pain and vomiting, there were subsequently
none of the usual violent symptoms; and she died within twenty
hours, complaining chiefly of tenesmus and excessive debility.<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c013'><sup>[252]</sup></a>
Occasionally eruptions break out over the body:<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c013'><sup>[253]</sup></a> but their nature
has not been described.</p>

<p class='c006'>Death is seldom owing to the mere local mischief, more generally
to sympathy of the circulation and nervous system with that
injury. According to Bouchardat death arises from the acid entering
the blood in sufficient quantity to cause coagulation.<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c013'><sup>[254]</sup></a> But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>although this certainly happens sometimes to the blood in the vessels
of the stomach and adjacent organs, as will be proved under the
head of the morbid appearances, there is no evidence that the same
takes place throughout the blood-vessels generally, or in the great
veins and heart in particular. Bouchardat’s proofs of the detection
of sulphuric acid in the blood are not satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c006'>The duration of this variety of poisoning with the acids is commonly
between twelve hours and three days. But sometimes life is
prolonged for a week<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c013'><sup>[255]</sup></a> or a fortnight;<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c013'><sup>[256]</sup></a> and sometimes too death
takes place in a very few hours. The shortest duration among the
numerous cases of adults mentioned by Tartra is six hours;<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c013'><sup>[257]</sup></a> but
Dr. Sinclair, of Manchester, has related a case which lasted only
four hours and a half;<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c013'><sup>[258]</sup></a> a man lately died in the Edinburgh Infirmary
within four hours; and Professor Remer of Breslau once met
with a case fatal in two hours.<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c013'><sup>[259]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The quantity required to produce these effects has not been ascertained,
and must be liable to the same uncertainty here as in other
kinds of poisoning. The smallest fatal dose of sulphuric acid I have
hitherto found recorded was one drachm. It was taken with sugar
by mistake for stomachic drops by a stout young man, and killed him
in seven days.<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c013'><sup>[260]</sup></a> An infant of twelve months has been killed in
twenty-four hours by half a tea-spoonful, or about thirty minims.<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c013'><sup>[261]</sup></a>
A man has recovered after taking six drachms.<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c013'><sup>[262]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>2. The second variety of symptoms belong to a peculiar modification
of disease, which is described by Tartra in rather strong language.
It begins with the symptoms already noticed; but these
gradually abate. The patient then becomes affected with general
fever, dry skin, spasms and pains of the limbs, difficult breathing,
tension of the belly, salivation, and occasional vomiting, particularly
of food and drink. Afterwards membranous flakes are discharged
by vomiting, and the salivation is accompanied with fœtor. These
flakes are often very like the mucous membrane of the stomach and
intestines; and such they have often been described to be. More
probably, however, they are of adventitious formation; for the mere
mucous coat of the alimentary canal cannot supply the vast quantity
that is evacuated. There is no doubt, however, that the lining
membrane of the alimentary canal is occasionally discharged. Dr.
Wilson has mentioned an instance of the ejection by coughing of
about nine inches of the cylindrical lining of the pharynx and gullet
six days after sulphuric acid was taken.<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c013'><sup>[263]</sup></a> Sometimes worms are discharged
dead, and evidently corroded by the poison.<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c013'><sup>[264]</sup></a> Digestion is
at the same time deranged, the whole functions of the body are languid,
and the patient falls into a state of marasmus, which reduces
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>him to a mere skeleton, and in the end brings him to the grave.
Death may take place in a fortnight, or not for months. In one of
Tartra’s cases the patient lived eight months. The vomiting of
membranous flakes continues to the last.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The third variety includes cases of imperfect recovery. These
are characterized by nothing but the greater mildness of the primary
symptoms, and by the patient continuing for life liable to attacks of
pain in the stomach, vomiting of food and general disorder of the
digestive function.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. The last variety comprehends cases of perfect recovery, which
are sufficiently numerous even under unpromising appearances.
From the average of 55 cases recorded by Tartra it appears that the
chances of death and recovery are nearly equal. Twenty-six died,
19 of the primary, 7 of the secondary disorder. Twenty-nine recovered,
and of these twenty-one perfectly. Suicidal are for obvious
reasons more frequently fatal than accidental cases.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tartra has not taken notice in his treatise of another form of poisoning
with the strong acids,—in which the injury is confined to
the gullet and neighbouring parts. In Corvisart’s Journal there is
the case of a man, who began to drink sulphuric acid for water
while intoxicated, but suddenly found out his error before he had
swallowed above a few drops; and consequently the chief symptoms
were confined to the throat. After his physician saw him he was
able to take one dose of a chalk mixture; but from that time he was
unable to swallow at all for a fortnight.<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c013'><sup>[265]</sup></a> Martini likewise met with
a similar instance of complete dysphagia from stricture in the gullet
caused by sulphuric acid.<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c013'><sup>[266]</sup></a> His patient recovered.</p>

<p class='c006'>It also appears exceedingly probable, that the strong acids may
cause death, without reaching the stomach or even the gullet, by
exciting inflammation and spasm of the glottis and larynx. Such an
effect may very well be anticipated from an attempt to commit murder
with these poisons; as the person, if he retains consciousness at
the time, may become aware of their nature before he has swallowed
enough to injure the stomach.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus, Dr. A. T. Thomson says in 1837, that he once met with
the case of a child, who, while attempting to swallow strong sulphuric
acid by mistake for water, died almost immediately, to all
appearance from suffocation caused by contraction of the glottis; and
it was ascertained after death that none of the poison had reached
the stomach.<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c013'><sup>[267]</sup></a> Professor Quain describes a similar case, occurring
also in a child, where impending death was prevented by artificial
respiration, and acute bronchitis ensued, which proved fatal in three
days. In this instance thickening of the epiglottis and great contraction
of the upper opening of the larynx showed the violent local injury
inflicted there, inflammation could be traced down the trachea
into the bronchial tubes, but no trace of injury could be detected in
the gullet and stomach.<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c013'><sup>[268]</sup></a> In a very interesting and carefully detailed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>case by Mr. Arnott, where the poison taken was the nitric acid, the
injury was confined in a great measure to the gullet and larynx,—the
stomach, which was distended with food at the time, being very
little affected. The chief symptoms at first, besides great general
depression, were croupy respiration and much dyspnœa, which became
so urgent, that laryngotomy was performed, and with complete
relief to the breathing. But the patient nevertheless rapidly sunk
under the symptoms of general exhaustion, and died in thirty-six
hours without presenting any particular signs of the operation of the
poison on the stomach; and the traces of action found there after
death were trifling.<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c013'><sup>[269]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The importance of the fact established by these cases will appear
from the following medico-legal inquiries. A Prussian medical college
was consulted in the case of a new-born child, in which the
stomach and intestines were healthy, and did not contain poison,
but in which the cuticle of the lips was easily scraped off, the gums,
tongue, and mouth yellowish-green, as if burnt, the velum and uvula
in the same state, the rima glottidis contracted, and the epiglottis,
larynx, and fauces violently inflamed. The College declared, that
a concentrated acid had been given, and that death had been occasioned
by suffocation. Sulphuric acid was found in the house; and
the mother subsequently confessed the crime.<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c013'><sup>[270]</sup></a> A case was formerly
quoted (p. <a href='#Page_75'>75</a>), where MM. Ollivier and Chevallier found traces of
the action of nitric acid on the lips, mouth, throat and upper fourth
of the gullet, but not lower. In this instance the reporters came to
the opinion from the absence of injury in the more important parts
of the alimentary canal, as well as from the marks of nail scratches
on the neck, and the gorged state of the lungs, that death had been
produced by strangling, after an unsuccessful attempt by the forcible
administration of nitric acid. It is quite possible, however, that
death might quickly ensue from the effects of the poison on the throat
and gullet. In the course of the judicial inquiries M. Alibert stated
that he had known repeated instances of death from swallowing nitric
acid, although none of it reached lower down than the pharynx.
Ollivier in his paper doubts the accuracy of this statement; but the
cases quoted above show clearly that such injury may be done to
the glottis as will be adequate of itself to occasion death.<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c013'><sup>[271]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It seems farther not improbable that, among the terminations of
poisoning with the strong mineral acids, scirrhous pylorus must also
be enumerated. This is a very rare effect of the action of corrosive
poisons. But M. Bouillaud has related an instance of death from
scirrhous pylorus in its most aggravated shape, which supervened on
the chronic form of the effects of nitric acid, and which proved fatal
in three months.<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c013'><sup>[272]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In some circumstances the stomach seems to acquire a degree of
insensibility to the action of the strong acids. Tartra, in alluding to
what is said of certain whisky-drinkers acquiring the power of swallowing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>with impunity small quantities of the concentrated acids, has
related the case of a woman at Paris, who, after passing successively
from wine to brandy and from that to alcohol, at last found nothing
could titillate her stomach except aqua-fortis, of which she was seen
to partake by several druggists of veracity.<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c013'><sup>[273]</sup></a> The fire-eating mountebanks
too are said to acquire the same power of endurance; but
much of their apparent capability is really legerdemain. On the
other hand, a very extraordinary sensibility to the action of the diluted
mineral acids has been supposed to exist in the case of infants at the
breast,—so great a sensibility, that serious symptoms and even
death itself have been ascribed to the nurse’s milk becoming impregnated
with sulphuric acid, in consequence of her having taken
it in medicinal doses. By two writers in the London Medical Repository
griping pains, tremors and spasms have been imputed to
this cause;<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c013'><sup>[274]</sup></a> and a writer in the Medical Gazette says he has seen
continued griping, green diarrhœa and fatal marasmus ensue,—apparently,
he thinks, from ulceration of the gastro-intestinal mucous
membrane.<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c013'><sup>[275]</sup></a> Without questioning the great delicacy and tenderness
of that membrane in infants, I must nevertheless express my doubts
whether so small a quantity taken by a nurse, amounting in the
cases in question only to four or six drops a day, could really produce
fatal or even severe effects on her child.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sulphuric acid is not less deadly when admitted into the body
through other channels besides the mouth. Thus, it may prove fatal
when introduced into the rectum. A woman at Bruges in Belgium
had an injection administered, in which, being prepared hastily in
the middle of the night, sulphuric acid had been substituted by mistake
for linseed-oil. The patient immediately uttered piercing cries,
and passed the remainder of the night in excessive torture. In the
morning the bed-clothes were found corroded, and a portion of intestine
had apparently come away; and she expired not long afterwards.<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c013'><sup>[276]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Death may also be occasioned by the introduction of this acid into
the ear. Dr. Morrison relates a case of the kind, where nitric acid,
which is analogous in action, was poured by a man into his wife’s
ear, while she lay insensible from intoxication. She awoke in great
pain, which continued for two or three days. In six days an eschar
detached itself from the external passage of the ear; and this was
followed by profuse hemorrhage, which recurred daily more or less
for a month. On the day after the eschar came away, and without
any precursory symptom referrible to the head, she was attacked
with complete palsy of the right arm, and in eight days more with
tremors and incomplete palsy of the rest of that side of the body.
These symptoms subsequently abated; but they again increased after
an imprudent exertion, and she died in a state of exhaustion seven
weeks after the injury. The whole petrous portion of the temporal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>bone was found carious, but without any distinct disease of the brain
or its membranes.<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c013'><sup>[277]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Sulphuric acid and the other mineral acids are equally poisonous
when inhaled in the form of gas or vapour; and they then act chiefly
by irritating or inflaming the mucous membrane of the air-passages and
lungs. For some observations on their effects in this form both on
plants and animals the reader may refer to the Chapter on Poisonous
Gases.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sulphuric acid belongs to the poisons alluded to under the head
of General Poisoning,—of whose operation satisfactory evidence
may be occasionally drawn from symptoms only. If immediately
after swallowing a liquid which causes a sense of burning in the
throat, gullet, and stomach, violent vomiting ensues, particularly if
the vomited matter is mixed with blood; if the mouth becomes
white, and stripped of its lining membrane, and the cheeks, neck, or
neighbouring parts show vesications, or white, and subsequently
brown excoriated spots;—if the clothes show red spots and are
moist and disintegrated there,—I cannot see any objection to the
inference, that either sulphuric or muriatic acid has been taken. In
this opinion I am supported by a good authority, Dr. Mertzdorff, late
medical inspector at Berlin.<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c013'><sup>[278]</sup></a></p>

<h5 class='c011'><span class='sc'>Section III.</span>—<i>Of the Morbid Appearances caused by Sulphuric Acid.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>The outward appearance of the body in cases of Tartra’s first
variety in the action of the acids is remarkably healthy; every limb
is round, firm, and fresh-looking.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the lips, fingers, or other parts of the skin, spots and streaks
are found where sulphuric acid has disorganized the cuticle. These
marks are brownish or yellowish-brown, and present after death the
appearance of old parchment or of a burn; sometimes there are little
blisters.<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c013'><sup>[279]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The lining membrane of the mouth is more or less disorganized,
generally hardened, and whitish or slightly yellowish. The pharynx
is either in the same state, or very red or even swelled. The rima
glottidis, as in the case described by Dr. Sinclair and in that of Mr.
Arnott, is sometimes contracted, the epiglottis swelled, or on the
contrary shrivelled, and the commencement of the larynx inflamed.<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c013'><sup>[280]</sup></a>
The gullet is often lined with a dense membrane, adhering firmly,
resembling the inner coat, but probably in general a morbid formation;
and the subjacent tissue is brown or red. Sometimes, however,
the inner coat or epithelian of the gullet loses its vitality, and
is detached in part or altogether. In Mr. Arnott’s case the pharynx
and upper gullet were lined by a pale lemon-coloured membrane,
which in the lower two-thirds of the canal was completely detached
and was plainly the œsophageal membrane; in the case related by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Mertzdorff, the whole inner coat of the gullet, as well as that of the
throat, epiglottis, and mouth, was stripped from the muscular coat;<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c013'><sup>[281]</sup></a>
and in Dr. Wilson’s case (p. <a href='#Page_131'>131</a>), which proved fatal in ten months,
the upper third of the gullet shone like an old cicatrix, and the lower
two-thirds were narrowed, vascular, and softened on the surface.<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c013'><sup>[282]</sup></a> In a few rare cases of chronic poisoning with the mineral acids the
gullet is found perforated by an ulcerative process;<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c013'><sup>[283]</sup></a> but it is never
perforated by their corrosive action in quickly fatal cases. Occasionally
the gullet is not affected at all, though both the mouth and
the stomach are severely injured; and an instance has even been
published where the acid, in this instance the nitric, left no trace of
its passage downwards till near the pylorus.<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c013'><sup>[284]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The outer surface of the abdominal viscera is commonly either
very vascular or livid, or bears even more unequivocal signs of inflammation,
namely, effusion of fibrin and adhesions among the different
turns of intestine; and these appearances may take place
although the stomach is not perforated.<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c013'><sup>[285]</sup></a> The cause of this appearance,
which is seldom observed in poisoning with other irritants,
more especially with the metallic irritants, is that the acid passes
through the membranes of the stomach by transudation during life,—as
will be proved immediately. It must be observed, that the
peritonæum is sometimes quite natural after death from sulphuric acid,
even although the stomach was perforated. I have seen this in a
case which proved fatal in twelve hours. An important appearance
in the abdomen, to which less attention has been hitherto paid than
it deserves, is gorging of the vessels beneath the peritonæal membrane
of the stomach and adjoining organs with dark, firmly coagulated
blood, arising from the acid having transuded through the membranes
and acted on the blood chemically. My attention was first turned
to this appearance by an interesting case, which I saw in 1840 in the
Royal Infirmary of this city, and of which an able account has been
published by Dr. Craigie.<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c013'><sup>[286]</sup></a> The whole vessels of the stomach were
seen externally to be most minutely injected and gorged, and the
blood in them was coagulated into firmly-cohering cylindrical masses,
as if the vessels had been successfully filled with the matter of an
anatomical injection. This appearance was also observed in the
superior mesenteric arteries, in the omental vessels, and over the
greater part of the mesentery. It was occasioned by the chemical
action of the acid coagulating the colouring matter and albumen; for
the clotted blood was strongly acid to litmus-paper. So too was the
peritoneal surface of the stomach, omentum and intestines. And
the acid had transuded through the stomach and into the omentum
and tissues of the intestines during life; for in the first place, there
was no perforation of the stomach, and secondly, I ascertained that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>there was no free acid either in the matter discharged from the
stomach before death after the free administration of antacids, or
in the contents of the stomach obtained at the examination of the
dead body.</p>

<p class='c006'>The stomach, if not perforated, is commonly distended with gases.
It contains a quantity of yellowish-brown or black matter, and is
sometimes lined with a thick paste composed of disorganized tissue,
blood and mucus. The pylorus is contracted.</p>

<p class='c006'>The mucous membrane is not always corroded. If the acid was
taken diluted, the coats may escape corrosion; but there is excessive
injection, gorging, and blackness of the vessels, general blackness of
the membrane, sometimes even without softening, as in a case related
by Pyl of a woman who first took aqua-fortis and then stabbed
herself.<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c013'><sup>[287]</sup></a> More commonly, however, along with the blackness there
is softening of the rugæ or actual removal of the villous coat, and
occasionally regular granulated ulceration with puriform matter on
it.<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c013'><sup>[288]</sup></a> The stomach is not always perforated. But if it is, the holes
are commonly roundish, and the coats thin at the margin, coloured,
disintegrated, and surrounded by vascularity and black extravasation.
In some rare cases there is no mark of vital reaction except in the
neighbourhood of the aperture. A case of this kind is related by
Mertzdorff: The margin of the hole was surrounded to the distance
of half an inch with apparent charring of the coats, and this areola
was surrounded by redness; but the rest of the stomach was grayish-white.<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c013'><sup>[289]</sup></a>
I examined with the late Dr. Latta of Leith a similar case,
where the limitation of the injury was evidently owing to the stomach
having been at the time filled with porridge. The patient, a child
two years old, died in twelve hours; and on the posterior surface of
the fundus of the stomach, towards the pylorus, there was a hole as
big as a half-crown, which was surrounded to the distance of an inch
with a black mass formed of the disorganized coats, and of incorporated
charred blood. But the rest of the stomach was quite
healthy. The most remarkable instance of chemical destruction of
the coats yet known to me is a case mentioned by Mr. Watson of
this city, where suicide was effected by cutting the throat about half
an hour after two ounces of sulphuric acid had been swallowed.
The individual was at first thought to have died simply of the wound
of the throat. But on dissection the usual signs of acid poisoning
were found; and among other effects, it was observed that nearly
three-fourths of the stomach had been entirely destroyed.<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c013'><sup>[290]</sup></a> The
perforation, if the patient lives long enough, is generally accompanied
with a copious effusion into the belly of the usual muddy liquor of
peritonitis; and the outer surface of the viscera feels unctuous, as if
from a slight chemical action of the acid on them. The acid has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>actually been found in the contents poured out from the stomach into
the sac of the peritonæum.<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c013'><sup>[291]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>One would expect to find the acid always in the stomach when it
is perforated. Nevertheless it is sometimes almost all discharged.
In Mertzdorff’s case, that of an infant who was killed in twelve
hours, a hole was found in the stomach ¾ths of an inch in diameter,
and the contents of the stomach were effused into the belly: yet by
a careful analysis the whole acid he could procure from the contents
and tissues together was only 4½ grains. Sometimes of course the
disappearance of the acid may be owing, as in Dr. Craigie’s case, to
the effectual administration of antacids during life.</p>

<p class='c006'>The inner coat of the duodenum often presents appearances closely
resembling those of the stomach. Sometimes, however, as in the
case just related from Mertzdorff, and in the infant I examined, the
inner coat of the small intestines is not affected at all, probably because
in such rapid cases the pylorus retains a state of spasmodic
contraction till death or even after it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The urinary bladder is commonly empty. The thoracic surface of
the diaphragm is sometimes lined with lymph, indicating inflammation
of the chest. In the case which was fatal in two hours [p.
<a href='#Page_131'>131</a>], Professor Remer found the surface of the lungs, as well as that
of the liver and spleen, brown and of a leathern consistence, and the
tissue beneath scarlet;—appearances which he thinks arose from
the acid penetrating in vapour and acting chemically. I have not
found this appearance mentioned by any other writer; but I have
seen it in animals poisoned with oxalic acid. The blood in the
heart and great vessels has been several times seen forming a firm
black clot. Kerkring<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c013'><sup>[292]</sup></a> relates an instance of the kind; in Dr. Latta’s
case the appearance was very distinct; and it is dwelt on strongly in
a recent paper by M. Bouchardat.<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c013'><sup>[293]</sup></a> Bouchardat thinks this state of
the blood is simply the effect of the absorbed acid; but coagulation of
the blood in the heart and great vessels,—a striking appearance in
contradiction to what is observed after death from most other poisons,—is
more probably the healthy state of the blood, and not the effect
of the particular poison.</p>

<p class='c006'>The general appearance of the body of those who have died of the
second or chronic variety of poisoning with the acids, is that of
extreme emaciation. The stomach and intestines are excessively
contracted: The former has been found so small as to measure only
two inches and a half from the cardia to the pylorus, and two inches
from the lesser to the greater curvature.<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c013'><sup>[294]</sup></a> Tartra says the intestines
are sometimes no thicker than a writing quill. They are in other
respects sound outwardly, except that they sometimes adhere together.</p>

<p class='c006'>Internally the pylorus is contracted. In a case of slow poisoning,
fatal in three months, which has been described by Dr. Braun of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Fürth, the chief appearance besides excessive emaciation was a
thickening of the coats round and behind the pylorus to such a degree
that the opening of the pylorus was formed of an almost cartilaginous
ring several lines broad, and only wide enough to pass a quill.<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c013'><sup>[295]</sup></a>
There are spots over the stomach apparently of regenerated villous
tissue, smoother and redder than the natural membrane. At the
points where the stomach adheres to the neighbouring organs, its
coats are sometimes wanting altogether, so that when its connections
are torn away, perforations are produced. The other parts of the
body are natural.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may in some circumstances be necessary to determine from the
appearances in the dead body whether sulphuric acid has been the
occasion of death or has been introduced into the body after death.
This may always be easily done. If a few drachms of sulphuric acid
be injected into the anus immediately after death, and the parts be
examined in twenty-four hours, it will be found, that wherever the
acid touches the gut, its mucous coat is yellowish and brittle, its
muscular and peritonæal coats white, as if blanched, and the blood in
the vessels charred; the injury is confined strictly to the parts actually
touched, is surrounded by an abrupt line of demarcation, and shows
no sign of inflammatory redness. Nitric acid produces nearly the same
effects. The whole tunics are yellow, and the disorganization is
greater. For these facts we are indebted to Orfila.<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c013'><sup>[296]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In closing this account of the morbid appearances, some observations
will be required on the force of evidence derived from them; because
circumstances may exclude all other branches of medical proof. In
many instances both of acute and of chronic poisoning with the strong
acids, I conceive, contrary to the general statements of most systematic
writers on modern medical jurisprudence, that distinct evidence might
be derived from morbid appearances only. Thus, what fallacy can
intervene to render the following opinion doubtful? In a case several
times alluded to as described by Mertzdorff, there were vesicles and
brown streaks on the lips, neck, and shoulders, similar to the effects
of burning,—almost total separation of the lining membrane of the
mouth, throat, epiglottis, and gullet,—perforation of the stomach,
with a margin half an inch wide, which was extensively charred, and
surrounded by a red areola. From the appearances alone Mertzdorff
declared that the child must have been poisoned with sulphuric acid.
Perhaps he should have said sulphuric or muriatic acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>Or take the case of Richard Overfield, who was condemned at
Shrewsbury Assizes in 1824 for murdering his own child, a babe three
months old, by pouring sulphuric acid down its throat. In the dead
body the following appearances were found: The lips were blistered
internally and of a dark colour externally; the gullet was contracted
and its inner coat corroded; the lining membrane of the mouth and
tongue of a dull white colour; the great curvature of the stomach
corroded and converted into a substance like wet brown paper; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>stomach perforated and a bloody-coloured fluid in the sac of the
peritonæum.<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c013'><sup>[297]</sup></a> If to these appearances be added the fact that the child’s
dress was reddened, what is there to prevent the medical jurist from
declaring, without reference to chemical evidence, that this case
must have been one of poisoning by sulphuric acid or some other
mineral acids?</p>

<p class='c006'>In like manner in the case of Mrs. Humphrey, who was condemned
at Aberdeen in 1830 for murdering her husband by pouring sulphuric
acid down his throat while he was asleep, there was found, on examining
the dead body, two brown spots on the outside of the lips,—whiteness
of the inside of the lips and of the gums,—glazing of the
palate,—redness, with here and there ash-coloured discoloration, of
the uvula, posterior part of the throat, pharynx and epiglottis,—abrasion
of most of the inner coat of the gullet,—erosion and dark-red ulceration
of the inner coat of the stomach in winding furrows. When to
these appearances it is added, that the man was in good health only
forty-seven hours before death, and was taken ill instantaneously and
violently with burning pain in the throat and stomach,<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c013'><sup>[298]</sup></a> it is not easy
to see what other opinion could be formed of the case, unless that he
died of poisoning with a mineral acid, and probably with sulphuric
acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>Among the appearances justifying an opinion where chemical evidence
happens to be wanting, not the least important seems to me to be the
peculiar turgescence and induration of vessels under the peritonæum
of the stomach and neighbouring organs, occasioned by the chemical
coagulation of blood in them. It is an appearance, which, when
once seen, cannot be confounded with any natural morbid phenomenon
I have ever witnessed.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am far from desiring to encourage rashness of decision, or to
revive the loose criterions of poisoning relied on in former times.
But there cannot, in my opinion, be a rational doubt that in the instance
of sulphuric acid there may often be distinct exceptions to the
general law regarding the feebleness of the evidence from morbid
appearances; and that a witness would certainly be guilty of thwarting
the administration of justice, if, relying on general rules, he refused
to admit such exceptions. What natural disease could produce
appearances like those described above? Assuredly no form of spontaneous
perforation bears any resemblance to that caused in most
cases of death from sulphuric acid; nor is it easy to mention any
combination of natural diseases which could produce the peculiar
conjunction of appearances remarked in the case of the man Humphrey.</p>

<h5 class='c011'><span class='sc'>Section IV.</span>—<i>Of the Treatment of Poisoning with Sulphuric Acid.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>Since this acid and the other mineral acids act entirely as local
irritants, it may be inferred that their poisonous action will be prevented
by neutralizing them. But in applying that principle to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>treatment it is necessary to bear in mind their extremely rapid operation;
for if much time is lost in seeking for an antidote, irreparable
mischief may be caused before the remedy is taken. Should it be
possible then to administer chalk or magnesia without delay, these
are the antidotes which ought to be preferred; but it may be well for
the physician to remember, that in the absence of both he may at
once procure a substitute in the plaster of the apartment beat down
and made into thin paste with water. M. Chevallier, in a paper on
the antidotes for the mineral acids, quotes five cases of poisoning with
sulphuric acid and two with nitric acid, where life seems to have
been saved by the speedy and free administration of magnesia, although
in some cases so large a quantity as two ounces of the poison
had been swallowed.<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c013'><sup>[299]</sup></a>—A solution of soap is another antidote of no
small value. While the antidote is in preparation, the acid should
be diluted by the free use of any mild fluid, such as milk or oleaginous
matters.—The alkaline bicarbonates are also excellent antidotes;
but their carbonates are ineligible, being themselves possessed of
corrosive properties. In a paper on poisoning with the mineral acids
by Dr. Lunding of Copenhagen, the author is disposed to ascribe the
large proportion of deaths in his practice to the system pursued in the
Copenhagen hospital of administering carbonate of potass as an antidote
daily for weeks together.<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c013'><sup>[300]</sup></a> On the other hand however it may
be mentioned, that in a late memoir, on this description of poisoning
Dr. Ebers of Breslau endeavours to show, that there is no reason to
dread the administration of the alkaline carbonates, even the carbonate
of potash, provided they be given with mucilaginous fluids and
syrup in a rather concentrated form; and he gives three cases illustrative
of the good effects of this mode of treatment, which he maintains
to be free of all danger, and preferable to every other antidotal
method, because the remedy may be administered in small volume,—an
advantage possessed by it especially over chalk or magnesia.<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c013'><sup>[301]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>After the proper antidote has been given to a sufficient extent, the
use of diluents ought to be continued, as they render the vomiting
more easy.—Some have recommended the stomach-pump for administering
antidotes and diluents; but this is unnecessary. When it is
wished to evacuate the stomach, there is an advantage in allowing it
to do so by its own efforts, if possible; because the evacuation is
accomplished in this way more completely than by the stomach-pump.
Besides, if the patient cannot swallow fluids, still less can
he suffer the tube of the stomach-pump to be introduced. On
several occasions, indeed, it has been found impracticable to introduce
it.<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c013'><sup>[302]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The treatment of the surpervening inflammation does not differ
from that of inflammation of the stomach. Where there is great difficulty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>of breathing, evidently from obstruction of the larynx, and where
the absence of abdominal pain, tension or vomiting affords a presumption
that little injury has been done to the stomach, laryngotomy appears
an advisable remedy, and has been known to give very great
relief.<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c013'><sup>[303]</sup></a> But the patient may nevertheless die soon of the sympathetic
disorder of the circulation.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>II.—<span class='sc'>Of Poisoning with Nitric Acid.</span></h4>

<p class='c012'>Nitric acid is more frequently used as a poison abroad than in this
country. But even in Britain it is not an uncommon cause of severe
accidents and death.</p>

<h5 class='c011'><i>Of the Tests for Nitric Acid.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>1. <i>When concentrated</i>, nitric acid is easily known by the odour of
its vapour, which is peculiar. When pure, the acid as well as its
vapour is colourless; when mixed with nitrous acid it is of various
tints, and generally yellow. The acid of commerce is at times rendered
impure by sulphuric acid, a circumstance which must be attended
to in applying the subsequent tests.—The simplest test for nitric
or nitrous acid is the action of copper, lead, or tin. If any of these
metals in small fragments, or powder, be thrown into either
acid previously diluted with an equal volume of water, an effervescence
takes place, which in the case of lead or copper is much accelerated
by heat; nitric oxide gas is disengaged; and ruddy fumes
of nitrous acid gas are formed when the gas comes in contact with
the oxygen of the air. Another characteristic test, which has the advantage
of being applicable on an extremely small scale, is morphia,
the alkaloid of opium. This substance is turned in a few seconds to
a beautiful orange-red colour by nitric acid, and after longer contact
forms with it a bright yellow solution. No other acid has this effect.
Muriatic acid, as Dr. O’Shaughnessey has remarked,<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c013'><sup>[304]</sup></a> does not act
at all on morphia, and sulphuric acid chars and blackens it. When
nitric acid is added to a solution of narcotin in sulphuric acid, the
colour of the solution is changed from yellow to blood-red.<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c013'><sup>[305]</sup></a> When
it is added to a solution of proto-sulphate of iron, the solution becomes
brown, and the addition of sulphuric acid then alters the colour
to violet.<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c013'><sup>[306]</sup></a> When it is added even in the most minute proportion
to sulphuric acid, the addition of a few particles of the alkaloid brucia
will render the whole fluid red, passing gradually to yellow.<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c013'><sup>[307]</sup></a>—Many
other characteristic tests might be mentioned; but those now
specified are more than enough.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. <i>In a diluted state</i> this acid is not so easily recognised as the other
mineral acids, for it does not form any insoluble salt or precipitate
with bases.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>The most convenient process consists in first ascertaining the acidity
of the fluid, then neutralizing it with potass, evaporating to dryness,
and heating the residue in a tube with sulphuric acid. The vapour
disengaged, if abundant, may be known by its orange colour in the
tube and its odour. But if small in quantity it is best to distil over
the vapour in a proper apparatus, and to subject the condensed product
to the tests of morphia, narcotin dissolved in sulphuric acid, and
proto-sulphate of iron dissolved in water. A convenient tube for the
purpose is that represented in Fig. 3; into which the materials
are introduced by the funnel, Fig. 4. The wide part of the tube
may then be drawn out in the spirit-lamp flame to any length or
fineness that may be necessary, so as to conduct the vapour into
another tube as a condenser, or directly into the substances to be
used as tests.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. <i>When in a state of compound mixture</i>, nitric acid, like sulphuric
acid in similar circumstances, may be after a time partly decomposed
and partly neutralized; and when the matter with which it is
mixed belongs to either of the organic kingdoms, more particularly
to the animal world, its decomposition is more rapid than that of
sulphuric acid. Still it is an important fact, that some of the acid
may be discovered after a considerable interval. M. Ollivier detected
it in various stains on the skin at least a day after it had been
applied;<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c013'><sup>[308]</sup></a> Dr. O’Shaughnessey detected it in a stain on cloth sent
to him from Ireland to Edinburgh;<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c013'><sup>[309]</sup></a> and I have found it in stains
made on broad-cloth with detached drops seven weeks before.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Process for Stains.</i> Nitric acid produces on the skin a yellow
stain, which gradually becomes dirty orange, and finally of a dirty
yellowish-brown; but in all of these states it is at once rendered for
a time lively yellow by the action of ammonia. I am not aware that any
other yellow stain is similarly affected. Stains on cloth are generally
yellow, reddish-yellow, or brownish-yellow, and are attended with more
or less disintegration of the texture of the cloth. The method of analyzing
all these stains is as follows:—The stained parts is to be
boiled in a few drachms of pure water several times in succession;
and the liquid is then filtered, and may be subjected to litmus-paper
for the purpose of ascertaining its acidity. It is then to be rendered
neutral, or for the sake of greater facility, feebly alkaline, by adding
a few drops of a diluted solution of caustic potass, after which the
whole is evaporated to dryness, and in a vapour-bath, if practicable.
The residuum is then to be decomposed by sulphuric acid in the same
way as recommended above for the simple diluted acid.—Orfila
thinks it advantageous to let the stains macerate for some hours in a
solution of bicarbonate of soda rather than to boil them in water.
In that case, however, it is necessary to ascertain the acidity
of the stains with litmus-paper before proceeding to macerate
them.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Process for Mixtures.</i> The detection of nitric acid in compound
mixtures, such as the contents of the stomach, is not so easy a matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>as its detection in stains; and indeed a sure and delicate process is
still a desideratum in medico-legal chemistry. The process varies,
as in the case of sulphuric acid, according as the subject of analysis
is acid or neutral.</p>

<p class='c006'>a. <i>If the mixture be acid</i>, and the proportion of the acid considerable,
it maybe detected without difficulty. It is merely necessary
to ascertain the acidity of the mixture by litmus-paper, to neutralize
with potass, water being added if necessary, and then to filter and
evaporate to a convenient degree of concentration. Crystals will
form on cooling, which may be decomposed by sulphuric acid in the
usual way. But the medical jurist ought not to flatter himself with
the expectation of meeting often with a proportion large enough to
admit of being discovered by so coarse a method of analysis. In
general the crystallization of the nitrate of potass is prevented by
co-existing animal or vegetable matter. When the proportion appears
inconsiderable, therefore, a different process must be pursued.
In preparing the former edition of this work, the present topic was
investigated with some care, and a method suggested which appeared
to me at that time more effectual, delicate, and conclusive than any
previously made public. Since then Professor Orfila has also investigated
the subject attentively, and after trying various methods, has
ended in adopting one which is substantially the same as that now
referred to, but without a precaution, which seems to me essential
for success in certain probable enough circumstances.<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c013'><sup>[310]</sup></a> I am therefore
disposed to retain my former process, with some variations and
additions in the details.</p>

<p class='c006'>Macerate the subject of analysis for a few hours in distilled water,
if it be not already liquid enough; and then boil for a few minutes,
and filter it. Ascertain now whether the fluid be acid to litmus;
and if it be so, neutralize it with solution of potash, or as Orfila
suggests, with a solution of the purer salt, the bicarbonate of soda.
Evaporate gently, to obtain crystals if possible; and if these do not
tend to the cubical form, distil them with sulphuric acid, and proceed
as directed for nitric acid simply diluted. If crystals do not
appear, or their form tend to the cube,—in which case chloride of
sodium is present,—redissolve the whole residue of evaporation in
distilled water; add a slight excess of a warm solution of acetate of
silver, to throw down organic matter and the chlorine of any chlorides
that may be present; filter and evaporate to dryness, and distil the
residuum with sulphuric acid, applying as usual to the vapour the
tests of litmus-paper and morphia,—also, as Orfila proposes, the
solution of narcotin in sulphuric acid, and proto-sulphate of iron in
water,—and if the quantity of vapour be great enough, the sense of
smell and the action of copper with the condensed vapour.</p>

<p class='c006'>b. <i>If the mixture be neutral</i>, proceed exactly as above, except that
it becomes unnecessary to neutralize the liquid with potash or bicarbonate
of soda. This variety in the process will be principally required,
where earths or alkalis have been administered as antidotes.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>The process now detailed requires a word or two of commentary.—Organic
matter is inconvenient because it prevents the nitrate
of potash or soda in the mixture from crystallizing. But it will not
prevent the evolution of nitric acid vapour by distillation with sulphuric
acid, even although the material be a simple extract without
crystals. At the same time it is better to get rid of as much organic
matter as possible, if distinct crystals be not obtained by evaporation.
A more serious difficulty, however, to which Orfila does not
advert, arises from the co-existence of a chloride. For, in that case,
distillation with sulphuric acid may disengage not nitric acid, but
chlorine, in consequence of the reaction which takes place between
the nitric and hydrochloric acids in the act of being liberated. This
is a more important reason for purifying the liquid by acetate of silver
before subjecting it to concentration; but in addition, by removing
organic matter, this precaution increases the chance of crystals of
nitrate of potash or soda being obtained. Its necessity, where a
chloride co-exists, will appear from the following experiment. Four
drops of nitric acid neutralized with potass were mixed with six
ounces of strong barley-broth; from which half an ounce of limpid
fluid was procured by filtration. One-half of this evaporated to dryness
gave a crystalline residue, which, heated with sulphuric acid in
a tube, emitted a strong odour of chlorine; and the moisture which
bedewed the tube scarcely affected morphia. The residuum of the
other half of the filtered fluid was redissolved, treated with acetate
of silver, again filtered, and evaporated to dryness; and the residue
was gently heated in a tube with sulphuric acid. An odour of nitric
acid was now disengaged, and the moisture on the tube close to the
mixture turned a fragment of morphia to bright orange-red.</p>

<p class='c006'>Acetate of silver is prepared by mixing strong solutions of acetate
of potass and nitrate of silver, draining and compressing between
folds of bibulous paper the crystalline precipitate which forms,
dissolving this precipitate by agitating it in boiling water, and finally
crystallizing the salt again by refrigeration. The crystals, which are
sparingly soluble in cold water, should be then separated, slightly
washed with a little water, and again dried by compression. When
put to use, a solution should be made by agitating the salt in boiling
water, because at low temperatures water retains very little of the
salt; but actual ebullition should be avoided, because acetate of
silver is thus quickly decomposed.</p>

<p class='c006'>In all medico-legal analyses for nitric acid, care must be taken
that the different reagents used are free of this acid, and also of
nitrates. Sulphuric acid often contains a little nitric, or rather
nitrous acid; which may be discovered by the sulphuric acid becoming
brown or dark-red when a solution of proto-sulphate of iron
is gently poured over it in a test-tube; and which may be removed
either by boiling the acid with a few grains of sugar, according to
the formula of the Edinburgh Pharmacopœia, or, as Orfila directs, by
boiling it with sulphate of ammonia.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>All the observations made on these topics under the head of sulphuric
acid apply, with few exceptions, to the nitric acid also. A
few statements therefore on the peculiarities ascertained to exist in
the latter case are all that will be required in the present sections.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nitric acid is not less powerful as a corrosive and irritant than
sulphuric acid. It will act with energy as an irritant even when
considerably diluted, for example with six or eight parts of water or
even more.—The lips which are rendered at first whitish by all the
acids, and eventually brownish by sulphuric acid, becomes soon
yellow with nitric acid. The tongue too sometimes acquires a yellow
colour instead of a white glazed appearance; but this character is not
invariable.—All spots caused by it on the skin become speedily
yellow, and long retain this hue; or if the tint become dull, which
generally happens in a few days, it is enlivened and the yellow colour
restored for a time, by ammonia, potash, soda, or soap.—An important
fact, for which toxicology is indebted to Professor Orfila, is
that the acid may be often found in the urine, both when it had been
swallowed, and when it had been introduced through the medium of
the cellular tissue.<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c013'><sup>[311]</sup></a> It is to be discovered by the process for compound
mixtures. Orfila adds that he has hitherto been unable to find
it in the liver or spleen.</p>

<p class='c006'>A difference of tint in the lining membrane of the mouth and gullet
is the only difference observed in the morbid appearances caused by
nitric and sulphuric acid. The former sometimes renders these parts
yellow; but this appearance is far from being invariable.</p>

<p class='c006'>The treatment in both instances is the same in every respect.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>III.—<span class='sc'>Of Poisoning with Hydrochloric Acid.</span></h4>

<p class='c012'>This acid occurs more rarely than any of the other mineral acids
in medico-legal cases; a fact which appears singular enough on considering,
that it is a powerful corrosive, and more perhaps in the
hands of the working-classes than any other.</p>

<h5 class='c011'><span class='sc'>Section</span> I.—<i>Of the Tests for Hydrochloric Acid.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>Like the other acids, hydrochloric acid occurs in the concentrated
shape, in a state of simple dilution, and mixed with various matters,
especially from organic kingdoms.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Hydrochloric acid, <i>in its concentrated state</i>, is colourless, if pure,
but yellowish as usually sold; and it is easily known by the peculiar
appearance and odour of its fumes. A convenient additional
test, which, however, is not absolutely distinctive, is the formation of
white vapour when a rod dipped in it is brought near another dipped
in ammonia. If any farther evidence be desired, the strong acid
must be diluted with water, and examined by the tests for it in a diluted
state.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>2. <i>When diluted</i>, it is recognised with facility, first by litmus-paper,
and then by the nitrate of silver, which forms with it a dense, white
precipitate, the chloride of silver. This is soluble in ammonia, reappears
on neutralizing the ammonia by nitric acid, and is not redissolved
by a large excess of nitric acid, even aided by heat. Its
permanence under an excess of nitric acid distinguishes it from every
other silver salt, but the cyanide; which again is known by disappearing
when boiled with a large excess of the acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. In the last edition of this work I proposed for the detection of
hydrochloric acid in <i>compound organic mixtures</i> a process, to which
Professor Orfila has since made an important addition,<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c013'><sup>[312]</sup></a> and which
the investigations of that toxicologist, as well as my own, lead me to
suppose superior to any other yet suggested, although it is not entirely
free from objection. This process divides itself into two, according
as the subject of analysis is acid or neutral; but in the latter
case its indications are of dubious import.</p>

<p class='c006'>a. If the matter to be examined be acid, boil it with water if necessary,
filter, and distil it with a gentle heat till the residue acquire
the consistence of a very thin syrup. Subject the distilled liquor to
the tests for diluted hydrochloric acid. It will seldom be found there,
however, because it is apt to be retained by the co-existence of organic
matter. If it be not found, add to the thin extract in the retort
a slight excess of a strong solution of tannin, filter, and distil the filtered
liquid by means of a hot bath of solution of hydrochlorate of
lime (consisting of two parts of crystallized salt and one of water,)—taking
care that the temperature of the bath never exceeds 240°;
and stop the distillation just before the residuum becomes dry. Examine
now the distilled liquor with the tests for diluted hydrochloric
acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hydrochloric acid has a tendency to adhere with obstinacy to organic
matters, especially when these are abundant; and therefore
Orfila properly proposes to remove organic principles as far as possible
by precipitating them with solution of tannin. I have found,
as he did, that the acid may be obtained by distillation after this
measure, when it could not be obtained previously.—Orfila objects
to the process however that hydrochlorate of ammonia will pass over
in the distillation. But I have not found this to be the fact, when
the temperature did not rise above 240°; which in his experiments
seem to have been considerably exceeded.—A more important fallacy
is, that hydrochloric acid will be indicated by the process in a
mixture which contains both a neutral chloride, such as common
salt, and sulphuric acid. This fallacy can only be obviated by ascertaining
that sulphuric acid is not present.—But the most important
fallacy of all is, that free hydrochloric acid constitutes an essential
part of the gastric juice, and an ingredient of the secretions of
the stomach in various states of disordered digestion.<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c013'><sup>[313]</sup></a> It is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>easy to see how this fallacy can be obviated, unless the acid be obtained
in large quantity; nor am I prepared to say what quantity
would justify the conclusion, that the acid had been derived from an
external source. Dr. Prout once found between four and five grains
of pure acid in sixteen ounces of the fluid of water-brash.<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c013'><sup>[314]</sup></a> The
quantity of hydrochloric acid is to be known by drying, heating and
weighing the chloride of silver thrown down in the distilled fluid by
nitrate of silver, and allowing 100 parts of concentrated commercial
acid for 145 of chloride.</p>

<p class='c006'>b. When the mixture is neutral, hydrochloric acid can be no longer
detected in it without the aid of sulphuric acid to decompose the
chloride that has been formed. This should be added to the filtered
fluid obtained after organic matter has been separated by solution of
tannin. Hydrochloric acid will then distil over.—It is seldom
however that the discovery of the acid in this way will warrant the
conclusion, that it had ever existed free in the mixture whence it is
obtained. For it may have proceeded from chlorides contained in
the subject of analysis from the first, more especially chloride of sodium,
which exists in small quantity in all animal fluids and solids,
and more largely in many articles of food and drink. The only circumstance
indeed in which the detection of hydrochloric acid by decomposition
with sulphuric acid will yield any evidence,—and even
then the evidence will only be presumptive,—is when it is known
that an earth or alkali was given as an antidote, and when the alkali
or earth which was used is found in the suspected substance.</p>

<h5 class='c011'><span class='sc'>Section</span> II.—<i>Of the Action and Symptoms produced by Hydrochloric Acid.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>Hydrochloric acid has been found by Professor Orfila to exert the
same action as sulphuric and nitric acids; but it is a less powerful
corrosive and irritant.—In the gaseous state, it is a most destructive
poison to vegetables, as will be shown in the article on the Poisonous
Gases.</p>

<p class='c006'>The symptoms it occasions in man are very like those produced
by sulphuric acid. As few cases however of poisoning with this
substance have yet been published, its effects are not so well known
as those of the other powerful acids; and it may therefore be right to
mention the leading particulars of some of the cases which are met
with in authors.—Mr. Quekett has related the case of a man, who,
on arriving at home one day, told the woman he lodged with that he
had poisoned himself with spirit of salt, but presented at the moment
so little sign of uneasiness, that she at first scarcely believed him. In
a short time however he suddenly became faint and fell down. On
being removed to the London Hospital, magnesia and milk were
given, about three hours after the acid had been taken; but no relief
was experienced. He suffered intense thirst, complained of excessive
pain in the stomach and throat, and expired in about fifteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>hours.<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c013'><sup>[315]</sup></a>—Mr. J. F. Crawfurd of Newcastle has related a still more
rapid case which was occasioned by two ounces of an equal mixture
of hydrochloric acid and “tincture of steel,” probably the tincture of
chloride of iron. Vomiting occurred soon afterwards, but subsequently
ceased; there was no complaint made either of pain or heat
anywhere, or of thirst; and questions were answered intelligently.
But the pulse was imperceptible, and the muscles of the extremities
contracted; and death took place in five hours and a half.<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c013'><sup>[316]</sup></a>—Orfila
mentions that an hospital patient, affected with inflammation of the
brain after a fall on the head, having got by mistake from his nurse
45 grammes, or two fluid ounces, of hydrochloric acid, was attacked
with acute pain in the stomach, efforts to vomit, hiccup, extreme
restlessness, a small pulse, a fiery red tongue, blackness of the lips,
and a burning skin; and next day he died in a state of constant delirium,
and covered with a cold clammy sweat.<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c013'><sup>[317]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>These cases present nearly the same violence and variety of action
with that which results from the two other acids.</p>

<h5 class='c011'><span class='sc'>Section</span> III.—<i>Of the Morbid Appearances caused by Hydrochloric Acid.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>The morbid appearances are on the whole similar to what are
caused by sulphuric acid. In Mr. Quekett’s case the stomach outwardly
was leaden-coloured and its vessels gorged with black blood;
the intestinal peritonæum injected and speckled with fibrinous effusion;
the villous coat of the stomach lined with yellow, curdled milk,
and itself irregularly black here and there, as if charred, and in some
places softened and corroded, so that a rent was made in handling
it; the inner membrane of the duodenum similarly affected, and also
even the jejunum, though more irregularly. The contents of the
stomach were not acid, and did not contain any chloride.—In Mr.
Crawfurd’s case the villous coat presented black elevated ridges, as
if charred, and the furrows between were scarlet-red; black granular
extravasation had taken place at many points into the submucous
tissue; similar appearances were seen in the duodenum and jejunum;
and the lower part of the gullet looked as if it had been cauterized.—In
the case related by Orfila the gullet and pharynx were red, and
at one or two places excoriated; the stomach inflamed externally,
and its inner membrane spotted with gangrenous (?) patches, and very
brittle; the duodenum thickened, and the jejunum perforated by a
round worm.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='small'>ON POISONING WITH PHOSPHORUS AND THE OTHER BASES OF THE MINERAL ACIDS.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'><i>Of Poisoning with Phosphorus</i>.—The only other mineral acid that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>deserves mention is the phosphoric. It possesses properties nearly
analogous, and hardly inferior to those of the three acids already
mentioned. On its own account, however, it does not merit any
notice here, since it is much too rare to be within reach of a person
who intends to give or take poison. But it must be attended to,
because it is formed in the course of the action of a more common
poison, phosphorus. An attempt has actually been made to perpetrate
murder by means of this substance. A woman at Mengshausen
tried to poison her husband by putting into his soup a mixture of
phosphorus, flour, and sugar, used for poisoning rats. But the soup
having been kept warm on the stove, the man’s suspicions were
excited by its phosphorescence, and phosphorus was detected in it.<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c013'><sup>[318]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila found that two drachms of phosphorus given to dogs in fragments
caused death in twenty-one hours, that the whole stomach and
intestines were more or less inflamed, and that the phosphorus had
lost much of its weight, though vomiting had been prevented by a
ligature on the gullet; in fact the poison was partly oxidated. In a
state of minute division, as when dissolved in oil, twenty-four grains
caused death in less than five hours with all the symptoms of the
most acute irritant poisoning; and after death the stomach was found
extensively corroded, and perforated by two holes.<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c013'><sup>[319]</sup></a> Other experimentalists
have found that half a grain melted in hot water could kill
a dog;<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c013'><sup>[320]</sup></a> and that water, in which phosphorus had been simply received
in the process for preparing it, proved in small quantities fatal
to poultry.<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c013'><sup>[321]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>There is no doubt, therefore, that phosphorus is a dangerous poison
to animals. Its effects on man have not been often witnessed; but
the observations hitherto made will show that it is not less injurious
to him than to the lower animals. A grain and a half have actually
proved fatal to man, as appears from a case mentioned by M. Worbe.<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c013'><sup>[322]</sup></a>
The subject of the case was a stout young man who took a grain and
a half in hot water, after having previously taken half a grain without
sustaining injury. In seven hours, and not till then, he was attacked
with pain in the stomach and bowels, then with incessant
vomiting and diarrhœa, excessive tenderness and tension of the belly,—all
the symptoms in short of irritant poisoning; and he died exhausted
in twelve days. Another fatal case somewhat similar in its
circumstances has been related by M. Julia-Fontenelle.<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c013'><sup>[323]</sup></a> An apothecary,
after taking in one day first a single grain and then two grains
of phosphorus without experiencing any particular effects, swallowed
next day three grains at once in syrup. In the evening he felt generally
uneasy, from a sense of pressure in the belly, which continued
for three days; and then he was also seized with violent, continual
vomiting of a matter which had an alliaceous odour. On the seventh
day he had also spasms, delirium, and palsy of the left hand; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>death speedily ensued.—Dr. Maier of Ulm relates a singular case
occasioned by a portion of lucifer-match composition having been
swallowed intentionally. Vomiting and pain in the belly ensued,
then anxiety, restlessness, and excessive thirst, and death in about
fifteen hours.<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c013'><sup>[324]</sup></a>—M. Martin-Solon relates the case of a patient, affected
with lead palsy, who having taken considerably less than a grain
in the form of emulsion, was attacked with burning along the gullet
and in the stomach, mucous vomiting, tenderness of the belly, general
coldness and feebleness of the pulse. Afterwards the pulse became
imperceptible, the limbs neuralgic, the intellect clouded, and
the breathing stertorous; and he died in little more than two days.<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c013'><sup>[325]</sup></a>—In
the only other case I have hitherto found recorded death took
place in forty hours, and the symptoms were violent pain in the stomach
and continual vomiting, together with the discharge by clysters
of small fragments of phosphorus, which were discovered by their
shining in the dark, and subsequently by the appearance of burnt
spots on the bed-linen. In this case, which is described by Dr.
Flachsland of Carlsruhe,<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c013'><sup>[326]</sup></a> the quantity of the poison taken was not
ascertained. The patient, a young man, took it on bread and butter
at the recommendation of a quack, to cure constipation, general debility,
and impotence.</p>

<p class='c006'>At one time it was the custom to give small doses of phosphorus
in medical practice; but the uncertainty and occasional severity of
its operation have perhaps properly expelled it from most modern
pharmacopœias. Among other properties ascribed to it in medicinal
doses, it is said to be a powerful aphrodisiac: No such symptom
occurred in the first of the fatal cases just related, or is mentioned in
any of the others; but there is no doubt that medicinal doses sometimes
produce it.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the morbid appearances, the same changes of structure may
be expected as in the instance of the mineral acids generally. In
Worbe’s case quoted above, the skin was generally yellow, and here
and there livid; the lungs gorged with blood; the muscular coat of
the stomach inflamed, but the other coats not, except near the two
extremities of the organ, where they were black. In Flachsland’s
case much fluid blood was discharged from the first incisions through
the skin of the belly; the omentum and outside of the stomach and
intestines were red; the villous coat of the stomach presented an appearance
of gangrenous inflammation (probably black extravasation
only); the inner membrane of the duodenum was similarly affected;
the great intestines were contracted to the size of the little finger;
the mesenteric glands enlarged; and the kidneys and spleen inflamed.
In Maier’s case the peritonæum and omentum were dry and vascular,
the stomach and small intestines pale, the great intestines contracted,
almost empty, brownish-red, and here and there inflamed,
the liver large, and the blood everywhere liquid. The contents of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>the caput cœcum had an odour of phosphorus, and here were found
two yellowish lumps weighing eight grains, which shone when rubbed,
exhaled a phosphoric odour, and contained 0·6 of a grain of phosphorus.
In Martin-Solon’s case the gullet was cherry-red and its
epithelian brittle, the villous coat of the stomach grayish and brittle,
the solid viscera in the abdomen soft, and the cerebral membranes
congested.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Phosphorous acid</i>, the effects of which have been examined experimentally
by Professor Hünefeld of Greifswalde, differs in its
operation from phosphoric acid. Twenty-five grains had no effect
on a rabbit; but a drachm caused difficult breathing, restlessness,
bloody vomiting, slight convulsions, and death in twelve hours; and
the stomach was found not much injured. The urine contained
phosphoric acid.<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c013'><sup>[327]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of Poisoning with Sulphur.</i>—It does not appear that sulphur, which
resembles phosphorus in many particulars, bears any resemblance to
it in physiological properties;—which may be ascribed to its not
being susceptible of spontaneous acidification. It certainly possesses,
however, slight irritating properties. It is often given as a purgative,
which is sufficient to prove that it is not altogether inert; and the
veterinary school at Lyons found that a pound killed horses by producing
violent inflammation, recognizable during life by the symptoms,
and after death by the morbid appearances.<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c013'><sup>[328]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of Poisoning with Chlorine.</i>—Chlorine in its gaseous state acts
powerfully as an irritant on the windpipe and lungs, and on that
account will be noticed under the head of the poisonous gases. But
even in solution it retains to a certain degree its poisonous qualities.
Orfila says that five ounces of a strong solution of chlorine will kill
a dog in twenty-four hours, if it is kept in the stomach by a ligature,
and that two ounces diluted with twice its volume of water will prove
fatal in four days;—that the symptoms are those of irritation of the
stomach;—and that in the former case he found general redness and
blackness—in the latter ulceration of its villous coat.<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c013'><sup>[329]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Of Poisoning with Iodine.</span></h4>

<p class='c012'>Iodine is a poison of more consequence than chlorine, both because
it is becoming a more common article, and because it is more violent
in its effects on the animal economy.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Tests of Iodine.</i>—Iodine when pure is a solid substance easily
known by its scaly form, its resemblance in colour and resplendence
to polished iron, its peculiar odour, the violet fumes it forms when
heated, and the fine blue colour it produces with a solution of starch.
It is very sparingly soluble in water, but readily so in rectified spirit
and in aqueous solutions of certain salts, more especially the iodide
of potassium. Its ordinary forms in the shops are iodine itself, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>tincture, and the compound solution, where the solvent is a solution
of iodide of potassium in water. It stains the skin brownish-yellow;
but the stain is not permanent. Its fumes are intensely irritating to
the nostrils, throat, and lungs.</p>

<p class='c006'>When dissolved in water or in solutions of neutral salts, it communicates
to the fluid a yellowish-brown or reddish-brown colour, which
is destroyed by sulphuretted hydrogen, because the iodine is converted
into hydriodic acid. In the colourless fluid thus formed, if
treated with chlorine,—or in the original brown fluid without chlorine,—a
solution of starch, obtained by ebullition and subsequently
cooled, produces a fine blue colour and precipitate; and these, if the
solution be sufficiently diluted, disappear on boiling, reappear on
sudden cooling, and are removed permanently by a stream of sulphuretted
hydrogen. This is a very delicate and characteristic system
of tests. The best mode of using chlorine for decomposing hydriodic
acid is to let it descend in the gaseous form from the mouth
of a bottle of nitro-hydrochloric acid upon the fluid to be examined;
In this way an excess is easily avoided, which bleaches out the blue
colour. Sulphuric acid, though often recommended for the purpose,
does not act unless it contains nitrous acid,—from which however
the sulphuric acid of commerce is seldom quite free.</p>

<p class='c006'>When mingled with organic substances, the discovery of it is a
matter of some nicety; because many substances of this nature, especially
in the living body, quickly convert it into hydriodic acid.<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c013'><sup>[330]</sup></a>
Hence few cases can occur in medico-legal practice, where iodine will
be discoverable in its free state. The following method of analysis
will meet all possible cases.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Process for Compound Mixtures.</i>—Add water if necessary, and
filter. If either the fluid or solid part is little or not at all coloured,
test it with cold solution of starch, assisting the action of the test
on the solid part by trituration in a mortar. If a blue colour be
struck, which disappears under ebullition, and reappears under refrigeration
alone, or on subsequently allowing chlorine gas to descend
on the surface of the fluid, there can be no doubt of the existence of
iodine.—If the colour of the suspected mixture after filtration is so
deep that the action of the starch cannot be expected to yield
characteristic appearances, then both the solid and fluid parts should
be agitated with a third of their volume of ether; and after the
ethereal solution has arisen to the surface, it is to be removed and
tested with solution of starch. The blue colour will be now perhaps
struck, because the ether, in carrying off the iodine from the
mixture, leaves many coloured organic principles behind.</p>

<p class='c006'>Should free iodine not be thus detected, strong presumptive evidence
may still be procured of its actual presence, or of its having
been at one time present, by continuing the examination with the
view to detect hydriodic acid. This is described in p. <a href='#Page_159'>159</a>.</p>

<p class='c006'>By following this method of analysis, I have found that one grain
of iodine of potassium, which is equivalent to three-quarters of a grain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>of iodine, may be easily discovered in six ounces of urine,—a fluid
as complicated as can well be conceived.</p>

<p class='c006'>The process adopted by Professor Orfila is so nearly the same with
this, as scarcely to require being detailed. He uses nitric acid instead
of chlorine for decomposing the hydriodic acid. Chlorine,
however, is the most delicate reagent for the purpose, if it be used
in the way described above.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Action of Iodine and Symptoms in Man.</i>—Iodide has a twofold
action, one local and irritating, the other general, and produced only
when it has been administered long in frequent small doses.</p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila remarked that in doses of two drachms it excited in dogs
symptoms of irritation in the stomach; that death slowly ensued in
seven days, without the symptoms having ever become very violent;
and that the villous coat of the stomach was here and there yellow,
had also patches of yellow mucus lining it, and exhibited numerous
little ulcers of a yellow colour. He could not observe much injury
from iodine introduced into the cellular tissue; and more lately, Dr.
Cogswell remarked that in this way it merely induces phlegmonous
inflammation and the usual consequences.<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c013'><sup>[331]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>An important circumstance in regard to the physiology and medical
jurisprudence of this poison and its compounds is, that it may undoubtedly
be detected in the blood, both when a single large dose
has been taken, and in those persons who have used it for some time
medicinally. Cantu, an Italian experimentalist, discovered iodine in
such circumstances in the blood, sweat, urine, saliva and milk;<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c013'><sup>[332]</sup></a> and
Bennerscheidt, a German chemist, also found it in the blood, when
it had been employed outwardly.<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c013'><sup>[333]</sup></a> In the latter instance it could not
be detected in the serum, but it was detected in the crassamentum
by means of starch. Some interesting facts of the same nature have
also been ascertained by Dr. O’Shaughnessey, from which it appears
that even in acute poisoning with this substance, satisfactory proof
of its administration may be procured several days afterwards by analysing
certain secretions. In a dog poisoned with iodine, he detected
the poison in forty minutes in the urine, and occasionally in
the same secretion so late as the fifth day, when it died. It is singular,
however, that he could not find it in the same quarter on the
third day, although it existed at that time abundantly in the saliva.<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c013'><sup>[334]</sup></a>
In these experiments the iodine was always found in the form of hydriodic
acid, having been converted into that compound in the alimentary
canal. This change takes place with such rapidity, that on
one occasion, in the vomited matter discharged by a dog fifteen minutes
only after the administration of iodine, Dr. O’Shaughnessey
could find no iodine, but a large quantity of hydriodic acid.<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c013'><sup>[335]</sup></a>
Orfila has found it not only in the urine, but likewise in the liver of
animals.<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c013'><sup>[336]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Considerable uncertainty prevails as to the circumstances in which
we may expect iodine to be detected in the organs or secretions of
persons who have taken it. Thus it has been stated by an Italian
physician, Dr. Cristin, that in many individuals affected with dropsy,
struma, epilepsy, and other diseases, he had sought for iodine to no
purpose in the urine, bronchial mucus, and other excretory fluids.<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c013'><sup>[337]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>With regard to its operation on man, Orfila says, he has tried the
effects of four or six grains on himself, and that he found this dose
produce a sense of constriction in the throat, sickness, pain in the
stomach, and at length vomiting and colic. There is no doubt,
therefore, that in larger doses it will prove a dangerous irritant to
man as well as to dogs. Accordingly, Dr. Gairdner has noticed the
case of a child four years old, who died in a few hours after taking
about a scruple in the form of tincture;<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c013'><sup>[338]</sup></a> but he has not mentioned
the symptoms. Dr. Jahn of Meiningen mentions a case where an
over-dose produced violent pain in the belly, vomiting, profuse bloody
diarrhœa, coldness and blanching of the skin, rigors, quivering of the
sight and rapid pulse.<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c013'><sup>[339]</sup></a> Two similar cases are related in a recent
French journal; in one, which was produced by a drachm and a
half of the ioduretted solution of hydriodate of potass, nausea, with
acute pain and sense of burning in the pit of the stomach, followed
immediately; in an hour there was vomiting of a yellowish matter
which had the taste of iodine; excessive restlessness ensued, with
headache, giddiness and paleness of the countenance; and these
symptoms were not entirely dissipated for five days.<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c013'><sup>[340]</sup></a> In the other
case two drachms and a half of iodine were swallowed for the purpose
of self-destruction. A sense of dryness and burning from the
throat down to the stomach was immediately produced; lacerating
pain in the stomach and fruitless efforts to vomit succeeded; and in
an hour, when the relater of the case first saw the patient, there was
suffusion of the eyes, excessive pain and tenderness of the epigastrium,
and sinking of the pulse. Vomiting, however, was then
brought on by warm water; copious yellow discharges, possessing
the smell and taste of iodine, took place; and in nine hours the patient
was well.<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c013'><sup>[341]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>There is a singular uncertainty, however, in the action of one or
more large doses. Magendie says he has taken two drachms of the
tincture, containing about ten grains of iodine, without injury;<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c013'><sup>[342]</sup></a> Dr.
Gully, that he has given three times as much daily for some time;
Dr. Kennedy, that he gave an average of twelve grains daily in the
form of tincture for eighty days without observing any effect at all;
and Mr. Delisser, that he has given a patient thirty grains in a day
without injury.<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c013'><sup>[343]</sup></a> Dr. Samuel Wright met with the case of an infant,
not more than three years old, who took three drachms of the tincture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>at once, and suffered only from attempts to cough, some retching
and much thirst.<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c013'><sup>[344]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It further appears that in medicinal doses, such as a quarter of a
grain, frequently repeated, it is a dangerous poison, unless its effects
are carefully watched. For in consequence of accumulation in the
system, or gradually increasing action, it produces when long used
some very singular and hazardous symptoms; and like mercury, foxglove,
and some other poisons, it may be taken long without effect,
and at length begin to operate suddenly. The symptoms which it
then occasions are sometimes those of irritation; namely, incessant
vomiting and purging, acute pain in the stomach, loaded tongue,
rapid and extreme emaciation, violent cramps and small frequent
pulse. These symptoms may continue many days, and even when
subdued to a certain extent, vomiting and cramps are apt to recur
for months after.<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c013'><sup>[345]</sup></a> A fatal case of this form of affection has been
related by M. Zink, a Swiss physician. His patient, after taking too
large doses of iodine for about a month, was seized with restlessness,
burning heat of skin, tremors, palpitation, syncope, excessive thirst,
a sense of burning along the gullet, frequent purging of bilious and
black stools, priapism, and tremulous pulse. The symptoms of local
inflammation went off in a few days; but those of general fever continued;
and he died after six weeks’ illness.<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c013'><sup>[346]</sup></a> Another fatal case
has been described in Rust’s Journal. The leading symptoms were
pain in the region of the liver, loss of appetite, emaciation, quartan
fever, diarrhœa, excessive weakness; and after the emaciation was
far advanced a hardened liver could be felt. The patient appears to
have died of exhaustion.<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c013'><sup>[347]</sup></a> From this case, and another of which
the appearances after death will be presently noticed, it is not improbable
that iodine possesses the power of inflaming the liver.</p>

<p class='c006'>In another and more common affection, the patient is attacked
with tremors, at first slight and confined to the fingers, afterwards
violent and extending to the whole muscles of the arms and even of
the trunk. At the same time there is excessive and rapidly increasing
weakness, a sense of anxiety and sinking, a total suspension of
the function of digestion, rapid and extreme muscular emaciation,
tendency to fainting, and violent continued palpitation,<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c013'><sup>[348]</sup></a> accompanied
sometimes with absorption of the testicles in man, and of the
mammæ in females. In the midst of these phenomena the curative
powers of the poison over the disease for which it has chiefly been
used, namely, goître, are developed. It has been remarked in particular,
that the diminution of the goître keeps pace with the diminution
of the breasts, though at times either effect has been developed
without the other. An instance is related in Rust’s Journal of a
female, whose breasts began to sink after she had used iodine for
four months; and in four weeks hardly a vestige of them remained;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>but her goître was not affected.<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c013'><sup>[349]</sup></a> An American physician, Dr.
Rivers, has twice noticed barrenness apparently induced by the prolonged
use of iodine; and as in these instances the females were
young and previously very prolific, but ceased to bear children from
the time the iodine was used, his observations seem worthy of attention.<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c013'><sup>[350]</sup></a>
Dr. Jahn<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c013'><sup>[351]</sup></a> specifies among the leading effects of the poison
when slowly accumulated in the body,—absorption of the fat,—increase
of all the excretions,—dinginess of the skin, with frequent
clammy sweat,—hurried anxious breathing,—diuresis and an appearance
of oil floating in the urine,—increased discharge of fæces,
which are unusually bilious, but free of mucus,—increased secretion
of semen,—increased menstrual discharge,—swelling of the subcutaneous
veins and lividity of the lips,—feebleness of the pulse,
with superabundance of serosity in the blood,—impaired digestion
and diminished secretion of saliva and mucus. This affection,
which, in conformity with the name he has given it, may be termed
Iodism [<i>Iodkrankheit</i>], he contrasts with mercurialism, the constitutional
effect of the accumulation of mercury in the body; and he
considers the former not more unmanageable than the latter. The
dose required to produce these effects are very various. Some people
appear almost insensible to its action; in one instance, nine hundred
and fifty-three grains were taken in daily portions varying from two
to eighteen grains, without any bad effect;<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c013'><sup>[352]</sup></a> and I have known an
average of four grains daily taken for fifteen months, with the effect
only of increasing the appetite. On the other hand, Dr. Gairdner
has seen severe symptoms commence when half a grain was taken
three times a day for a single week;<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c013'><sup>[353]</sup></a> and Coindet has seen bad
effects from thirty drops of the solution of ioduretted hydriodate
taken daily for five days.<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c013'><sup>[354]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Iodine and iodide of potassium in medicinal doses have been
supposed by Dr. Lawrie to be capable of exciting in certain constitutions
an affection resembling <i>cynanche laryngea</i> in its symptoms,
consisting of inflammation of the salivary glands, glottis, and other
adjacent parts, and proving sometimes fatal.<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c013'><sup>[355]</sup></a> This property is
doubtful; but several instances have been published of profuse salivation
and soreness of the mouth during a course of iodine; it is
apt to cause chronic irritation of the Schneiderian membrane; and
some think that it may affect in like manner the bronchial membrane
in the lungs.<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c013'><sup>[356]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Morbid Appearances from Iodine.</i>—The only account I have seen
of the appearances left in the body after death from slow poisoning
with iodine is contained in the essay of Dr. Zink. In a second fatal
case which came under his notice he found enlarged abdomen from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>distension of the intestines with gases, enlargement of the other viscera
and serous effusion into the peritonæum; adhesion of the viscera
to one another; redness of the intestines, in some places approaching
to gangrenous discoloration; redness and excoriation of
the peritonæal coat of the stomach, and also of its villous coat; enlargement
and pale rose-red coloration of the liver. In the chest
serum was found in the sac of the pleura. The gullet was contracted
in diameter, and red internally.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>On Poisoning with Iodide of Potassium.</span></h4>

<p class='c012'>To these remarks on iodine a few observations may be added on
the iodide of potassium, one of its compounds, which is now generally
substituted in medicine for the simple substance. The tests
and actions of this poison have been examined by M. Devergie; and
more lately its medico-legal chemistry has been investigated by Dr.
O’Shaughnessey and Professor Orfila.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is sold in the shops of various degrees of purity. Pure iodide
of potassium is in white crystals, tending to the cubical form, permanent
in the air, possessing a faint peculiar odour, and easily
soluble in both water and rectified spirit. Another variety has the
same form, but possesses an odour of iodine, is often yellowish in
colour, and deliquesces slightly in moist air. This contains an excess
of iodine, but may be otherwise pure. A third variety is impure.
It presents less tendency to assume a crystalline form, is more
or less deliquescent, dissolves but partially in alcohol, and when dissolved
effervesces with acids. The principal ingredient in this
article is carbonate of potass; and sometimes the proportion of iodide
is inconsiderable. In one specimen I procured 74·5 per cent. of
carbonate of potass, 16 of water, and only 9·5 of iodide of potassium.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the solid state the iodide of potassium may be known by the
effect of strong sulphuric or nitric acid, which turns it brown with
effervescence, and when aided by heat disengages violet fumes of
iodine.</p>

<p class='c006'>In solution many tests will detect it, such as chlorine, nitric acid,
corrosive sublimate, acetate of lead, protonitrate of mercury, muriate
of platinum, and starch with chlorine or nitric acid. Chlorine or
nitric acid forms a brown or orange-coloured solution by disengaging
iodine. Corrosive sublimate forms a fine carmine-red precipitate,
the biniodide of mercury; acetate of lead a fine yellow precipitate,
the iodide of lead; protonitrate of mercury a yellow protiodide of
mercury, which gradually fades into a dirty brown. Solution of
starch, followed by chlorine in solution or in vapour, strikes a deep
blue colour, which, if the fluid is sufficiently diluted, disappears on
boiling, reappears on sudden cooling, and is permanently removed
by a stream of sulphuretted hydrogen gases. Of these tests the most
characteristic is starch with chlorine; and it is also extremely delicate.
Too much chlorine however bleaches the blue colour away.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>In compound mixtures most and sometimes all of these tests are
useless. If the mixture is deeply coloured, none will act characteristically.
If carbonate of potass be present in such proportion as is
often met with in the shops, the tests cannot be trusted to.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Process for Compound Mixtures.</i>—The following method of analysis
is applicable to all mixtures, organic and inorganic. Add water, if
necessary, and filter; and if the fluid which passes through is tolerably
free from colour, test a little of it with solution of starch and
chlorine. If the colour is too deep to admit of this trial, or the test
on trial does not act, unite the fluid and solid parts and transmit sulphuretted
hydrogen to convert any free iodine into hydriodic acid.
Drive off the excess of gas, supersaturate with a considerable excess
of potass, filter, and evaporate to dryness. Char the residue at a
low red heat in a covered crucible; pulverize the charcoaly mass,
and exhaust with water. This solution will probably act characteristically
with starch and chlorine; but on the whole it is better in
the first instance to remove some of the salts by evaporating to dryness,
and exhausting the residuum with alcohol. The alcoholic solution
contains the hydriodate of potass, with some other salts; and
on being evaporated to dryness, a residuum is left, on which, when
dissolved in water, the starch and chlorine will act characteristically.
No other test is necessary; and frequently no other test will act, on
account of co-existing salts.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have found that a grain of iodide of potassium may thus be easily
detected in six ounces of urine, which must be considered a very
complicated fluid. In the solution ultimately procured nitrous acid
struck a pale brown tint, and on the addition of solution of starch a
dark-blue precipitate was formed; which, after being sufficiently
diluted, disappeared under ebullition, leaving a colourless fluid. On
cooling, no change took place; but on the subsequent addition of a
drop of sulphuric acid, the blue colour and precipitation were immediately
restored. No other reagent acted characteristically, although
there was a sufficient quantity of solution to try the starch test ten
times at least.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. O’Shaughnessey has proposed a more complex method by
precipitation with chloride of platinum.<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c013'><sup>[357]</sup></a> Professor Orfila says it is
sufficient to boil and filter the suspected matter, and to heat first the
liquid and then the solid part with solution of chloride, when violet
vapours of iodine are disengaged, which may be condensed and
subjected to various tests.<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c013'><sup>[358]</sup></a> I have not compared this method with
the one I have been in the practice of using; but, notwithstanding
the strong assurances of its proposer, its superiority in point of delicacy
seems dubious, although no one can deny its simplicity.<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c013'><sup>[359]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Action and Symptoms in Man.</i>—From the experiments of Devergie
on animals, iodide of potassium seems to be in large doses an irritant,
though not a powerful one. Two drachms in an ounce of
water killed a dog in three days with violent vomiting, and signs of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>irritation were found in the stomach, namely, black extravasated
spots and ulcers in the middle of them. A solution injected into the
cellular tissue caused only local inflammation. Injected into the
jugular vein in the dose of four grains, it produced tetanus and death
in a minute and a half.<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c013'><sup>[360]</sup></a> The latter investigations of Dr. Cogswell
confirm essentially these results.</p>

<p class='c006'>Discrepant accounts have been given of the effects of iodide of
potassium on man. When first introduced into medicine, it was
conceived to be an active poison, not much inferior to iodine itself.
Many however have since had an opportunity of observing that it is
in general by no means so energetic. Its medicinal doses were gradually
raised from one grain to five, ten, twenty grains; and at last
Dr. Elliotson gave to not a few patients so much as two, four, or
even six drachms daily in divided doses, without observing any remarkable
effect.<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c013'><sup>[361]</sup></a> These and other similar observations however
were made at a period when the salt used in British practice was
much adulterated, often indeed containing eighty or ninety per cent.
of impurity; at the same time it does appear that large doses of a
pure salt have been occasionally taken with impunity. On the other
hand it has evidently in some instances acted with great force. Mr.
Alfred Taylor mentions a case, on the authority of Mr. Ericksen,
where five grains produced alarming dyspnœa, attended with inflammation
of the nostrils and conjunctiva of the eyes.<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c013'><sup>[362]</sup></a> An instance has
been published where twelve grains in four doses occasioned shivering,
vomiting, purging, general fever, and extreme prostration; and
the purging continued for some days.<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c013'><sup>[363]</sup></a> Dr. Moore Neligan informs
me he met with the case of an elderly lady in 1841, who, on taking
three five-grain doses for two days, while labouring under irregular
gout, was seized with severe headache, thirst, and swelling of the face;
which symptoms were succeeded in two days by swelling of the
tongue, ulceration of the gums, and profuse salivation for a week.
Dr. Lawrie says he has known two grains and a half given thrice in
one day, followed by great dyspnœa and irritation in the throat; and
is even inclined to think that death resulted on two occasions from
repeated medicinal doses.<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c013'><sup>[364]</sup></a> It would farther appear from some important
researches made in France, that the protracted use of iodide
of potassium in small doses with the food may produce serious derangement
of the health,—swelling of the face, headache, urgent
thirst, inflammation of the throat, violent colic pains, and frequently
bloody diarrhœa. A disease characterized by the symptoms now
described appeared repeatedly as an epidemic a few years ago in
various parts of France, and spread so widely in one parish, that not
less than a sixth of the whole population were attacked. After
several careful investigations, it seems to have been fully proved
that the affection was owing to the use of salt fraudulently adulterated
with an impure salt, obtained from kelp after the separation of carbonate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>of soda, and consequently impregnated with an appreciable
proportion of hydriodate of potass.<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c013'><sup>[365]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It is difficult to arrive at any satisfactory conclusions from these
statements as to the nature and energy of the action of this salt as a
poison. But on the whole it appears to be not in general very active;
and the few instances of unusual activity which have occurred may
probably be put to the account of idiosyncrasy. The most remarkable
of its idiosyncratic effects from medicinal doses are salivation,
and a series of symptoms which imitate sometimes catarrh, and sometimes
a cold in the head. I do not know any facts to warrant the
general statement of M. Devergie that 18 or 30 grains may constitute
a fatal dose.<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c013'><sup>[366]</sup></a> The present question is far from being unimportant in
a medico-legal point of view. Mr. A. Taylor mentions the heads of
a case, very dubious however in its nature, where it was suspected
that a single dose of six grains of iodide of potassium had been the
occasion of death.<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c013'><sup>[367]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It is important to remember in medico-legal researches, that iodide
of potassium may be detected in the blood, liver, spleen, muscles,
urine, and other textures and secretions; and especially that it may
be found in the urine, when it may no longer exist in the alimentary
canal or in vomited matters. These interesting facts have been
clearly proved by the researches of Wöhler,<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c013'><sup>[368]</sup></a> Stehberger,<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c013'><sup>[369]</sup></a> O’Shaughnessey,<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c013'><sup>[370]</sup></a>

<p class='c006'><i>Of Poisoning with Bromine.</i>—This singular substance is not an
object of much interest in relation to medical jurisprudence, because
it is rare, and only to be met with in the laboratory of the chemist.
Hence, although it appears to be a poison of some activity, it scarcely
requires to be dwelt on particularly.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is easily known from all other substances by its fluidity, its great
density, which is thrice as great as that of water, its reddish-brown
colour by reflected, and blood-red colour by transmitted light, the
orange fumes which occupy the upper part of a bottle partly filled
with it, and its intensely acrid suffocating vapour, which is so irritating
that an incautious inhalation is followed by all the phenomena
of severe coryza and catarrh. Its odour, however, apart from its
acridity, is very far from being so disagreeable as its discoverer in
naming it seems to have imagined. In its properties it bears a close
resemblance to chlorine and iodine.</p>

<p class='c006'>The toxicological effects and medico-legal relations of bromine have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>been examined by M. Barthez,<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c013'><sup>[372]</sup></a> Dr. Butske,<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c013'><sup>[373]</sup></a> Dr. Dieffenbach,<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c013'><sup>[374]</sup></a> and
Dr. M. Glover.<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c013'><sup>[375]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>M. Barthez has given the following process for detecting bromine
in compound mixtures, such as the contents of the stomach or vomited
matter. First separate the fluid matter by filtration, and subject
it to the action of chlorine, which will produce a fine orange colour.
Should this effect not result, or the change of colour be observed by
the deep tint of the fluid, treat the solid matter with solution of caustic
potass; filter and add what passes through to the former fluid; evaporate
to dryness and char by a red heat; act on the residue with
distilled water. The solution contains the bromide of potassium,
and is therefore turned orange-red by chlorine. The orange tint,
whether struck at once in the fluid part of the mixture, or after carbonization
and solution of the residue, is removed by agitation with
ether; and the etherial solution of bromine in its turn loses colour
when treated with solution of caustic potass, hydro-bromate of potass
being again formed.</p>

<p class='c006'>M. Barthez found, that a solution of twelve grains injected into
the jugular vein of a dog, sometimes occasioned immediate tetanus
and death; and that the heart was gorged with clotted blood.
Sometimes however even seventeen drops did not prove fatal, but
produced merely restlessness, difficult breathing, dilated pupil, frequency
of the pulse, and sneezing. Dieffenbach remarked similar
effects in the rabbit: The animal either died immediately, or soon
recovered altogether. In a cat, after the injection of twelve drops of
a concentrated solution into its jugular vein, death took place in
fifteen minutes; but in another from which a little blood was drawn
after the symptoms were fully formed, complete recovery gradually
ensued. Butske found a horse suffer so much from mortal prostration
immediately after five grains dissolved in two ounces of water were
injected into its jugular vein, that he supposed it was about to die;
but it quickly revived, and ultimately got quite well. Dr. Glover
obtained similar results. When recovery took place, the leading
symptoms were panting, sneezing, discharge from the nostrils, rigors
and debility.</p>

<p class='c006'>When introduced into the stomach of dogs, M. Barthez found that
twenty drops on a full stomach had no particular effect; that thirty
drops occasioned vomiting, and temporary acceleration of the pulse
and breathing; and that from forty to sixty drops on an empty stomach
brought on violent vomiting, sneezing, cough, dilated pupil and
prostration, succeeded in a few hours by languor without any other
symptom, and by death in four or five days. In the dead body he
remarked numerous little ulcers of the villous coat, some of which
had an ash-gray appearance at the bottom, while others were covered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>with a black slough, easily removed by friction. When the gullet
was tied to prevent vomiting, less doses proved more quickly fatal.
He likewise observed that the matter vomited in these experiments,
even a few minutes after the administration of the poison, had no
appearance or odour of bromine; whence it is reasonable to conclude,
that, as in the instance of iodine, a chemical change takes place with
the aid of certain vital operations, so that the bromine becomes hydrobromic
acid.—The experiments of Dr. Butske assign to it more
activity as a poison than those now related. For he found that a
dog died in a day from taking only five grains dissolved in two
ounces of water; and the symptoms were laborious breathing, loud
cries, and convulsions. In the dead body he found the stomach internally
chequered with bloody extravasation, and filled with bloody
mucus, the duodenal mucous membrane universally injected, but the
rest of the alimentary canal in a healthy state.—Dr. Glover remarked
in such cases, besides the usual symptoms of an irritant action on the
stomach, coryza, sneezing, salivation and difficult breathing. Sixty
minims killed a cat in seventeen minutes, two fluid drachms a dog in
five hours and a half, ten grains a rabbit in five minutes. A dog
twice got twenty grains in solution and recovered, but died after a
third dose of the same amount. Another got twenty grains in solution
every two or three days for a month without injury. In some
of these experiments hydrobromic acid was detected in the blood
and urine.</p>

<p class='c006'>Little is yet known of the effects of bromine on man. Butske
found that a drop and a half in half an ounce of water produced a
sense of heat in the mouth, gullet, and stomach, and subsequently
colic pains; and that two drops and a half in an ounce of mucilage
excited, in addition to the preceding symptoms, great nausea, hiccup,
and increased secretion of mucus. On the other hand M. Fournet,
who gave doses gradually increasing from two to sixty drops daily
for many weeks, observed that the lowest doses excited itching in the
hands and feet, and sometimes colic; that an increase in the quantity
caused heat in the chest and nausea; and that forty-five drops occasioned
also severe burning and sense of acidity in the stomach,
which however were temporary. The appetite was in general rather
improved, and the body became more plump.<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c013'><sup>[376]</sup></a>—Bromine appears
on the whole to be a pure local irritant. It acts most energetically
when most thoroughly dissolved in water.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Hydrobromic acid</i> seems from the experiments of Dr. Glover to be
a pure irritant and corrosive, allied in action and energy to hydrochloric
acid. The same experimentalist found that <i>bromine of potassium</i>
in the dose of forty grains had sometimes little or no effect
on dogs when injected into the blood-vessels, while in other instances
less doses cause speedy death by paralysing the heart. Barthez observed
that half a drachm in solution produced dulness and depression
in dogs, but no other bad effect; and that two drachms retained
in the stomach by tying the gullet occasioned death in three days
with symptoms of irritant poisoning. M. Maillet observed that two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>ounces of this salt in the form of ointment, administered to a dog by
rubbing it over his nose, and letting him lick it off and swallow it,
had no effect whatever.<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c013'><sup>[377]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING WITH ACETIC ACID.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>Acetic acid, although in its ordinary state undoubtedly possessed
of little activity as a poison, has nevertheless proved in some circumstances
deleterious, and capable of occasioning death even in the
human subject. It exists in various forms. The most common is
ordinary vinegar, in which it is much diluted. Another common
form is the pyroligneous vinegar, pyroligneous acid, or pyroligneous
acetic acid, as it is variously called, which when impure has a reddish-brown
colour, but when pure is almost or altogether colourless, and
the strength of which is much greater than that of common vinegar.
What is called proof vinegar has a density about 1005, and contains
about four per cent. of concentrated acid. The pyroligneous acid
sold in the shops of this town has a density about 1035, and contains
about 25 per cent.; but the pyroligneous acid of the London Pharmacopœia
is stronger, for its density is 1050, and 100 parts contain
about 50 of the strong acid. A third form is the concentrated or
pure acetic acid of the apothecary, which is familiarly known as the
chief ingredient and menstruum of a common perfume, aromatic
vinegar.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> I.—<i>Of the Tests for Acetic Acid.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>In all its forms acetic acid is easily known by its very peculiar
odour, together with its acid reaction on litmus. But if farther evidence
of its nature be required, it will be requisite to neutralise the
fluid suspected to contain it with carbonate of potass, and then to
procure the acetate of potass by evaporation. This salt is known by
its extreme tendency to deliquesce, and by a concentrated solution
in water, yielding, when distilled with sulphuric acid, a fluid possessing
the peculiar odour and pungency of concentrated acetic acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>When in a state of compound admixture with organic substances,
such as the contents of the stomach, it has been proved by late researches
of Orfila,<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c013'><sup>[378]</sup></a> that this acid may be present in considerable
proportion without distinctly reddening litmus. For such mixtures
the following process of analysis, devised by the Parisian professor,
will be found convenient and effectual. The fluid being put into a
retort with a receiver attached, the retort is to be heated in a muriate
of lime bath till the residuum be dry. The distilled fluid may then
be tested tentatively for sulphuric and muriatic acids; and these being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>proved to be absent, the acidity and peculiar smell of the liquid will
supply strong presumption of the presence of acetic acid. This presumption
may be turned to certainty by forming acetate of potass, as
already directed for the pure diluted acetic acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila has omitted in his paper a serious fallacy to which this, as
well as every process for the detection of acetic acid in the contents
of the stomach is exposed,—namely, that the natural secretions of
the stomach, according to the researches of many physiologists, but
more especially in recent times those of Tiedemann and Gmelin in
Germany, and those of Leuret and Lassaigne in Paris, frequently
contain a small proportion of acetic acid. Hence, the inference in
favour of the introduction of acetic acid into the stomach from without,
founded on the process related above, is only legitimate when
the quantity discovered is considerable.—The medical jurist ought
also to keep in mind that vinegar is a common remedy with the
vulgar for many diseases, and especially for poisoning.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> II.—<i>Of the Effects of Acetic Acid on Man and Animals.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>In the first edition of this work, it was stated that acetic acid could
scarcely be considered a poison. And in illustration, a case was
mentioned which fell under my own notice,—that of a gentleman,
who during dinner swallowed at a draught about eight ounces of
vinegar by mistake for beer, and who nevertheless sustained no harm
although he retained it all, and as the only measure of precaution,
swallowed after it an equal quantity of port wine. In farther confirmation
of what is here mentioned, it may be added, that an ounce
of acid equal in strength to the pyroligneous vinegar, has been found
by Schubarth of Berlin to produce very little effect when administered
to a dog. The animal merely frothed a little at the mouth;
cried and became restless for a time; then had one or two attacks of
vomiting; and in an hour appeared quite well again.<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c013'><sup>[379]</sup></a> Nay, it has
even been found by Pommer of Heilbronn, that a considerable
quantity of diluted acetic acid may be injected into the blood without
causing any mischief. He injected six drachms of distilled vinegar
into the femoral vein of one dog, and an ounce into the jugular
vein of another, but observed no effect whatever, except a slight
labour of respiration for a short time afterwards.<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c013'><sup>[380]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It appears, however, from some experiments performed by Professor
Orfila on occasion of a judicial case to be mentioned presently,
that all the forms of acetic acid will prove injurious and even fatal
to dogs, if given in sufficient quantity and prevented from being discharged
by vomiting. An ounce of pyroligneous vinegar, administered
to dogs of middle size, and retained in the stomach by a ligature
on the gullet, produces efforts to vomit, evident suffering, prostration
of strength, and death in five, seven, or nine hours. An
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>ounce of concentrated acetic acid occasioned death in one hour and
a quarter; and four or five ounces of common vinegar proved fatal
in ten or fifteen hours. These experiments would make it appear
that acetic acid is scarcely less active as an irritant poison than even
the mineral acids.<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c013'><sup>[381]</sup></a> They are in some measure confirmed by the
prior experiments of Schubarth; who operated, however, with an
impure reddish-brown pyroligneous acid, and was led to ascribe its
energy to the presence of some empyreumatic oil, because he found,
as was already remarked, that a pure acid of equal strength appeared
almost inert. From half an ounce to an ounce of the impure acid
given to dogs, caused fruitless efforts to vomit, sometimes free vomiting,
occasionally great flow of tears, always weakness in the hind-legs,
and feeble, irregular pulse, and death either in two days without
any new symptom of consequence, or more rapid death in four or
five hours, with previous convulsions, and sometimes insensibility.<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c013'><sup>[382]</sup></a>
These experiments were made with an acid which neutralized 50
grains of carbonate of lime per ounce, consequently contained at
least 50 grains of concentrated acid, or about a tenth of its weight.</p>

<p class='c006'>To these observations it may be added, that according to the experiments
of Hébréart, a small quantity of acetic acid dropped into
the windpipe, produces hissing respiration, rattling in the throat, and
death in three days from true croup.<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c013'><sup>[383]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In all the preceding experiments distinct evidence was obtained in
the dead body of the irritant action of the poison. The stomach
contained brownish-black blood, the villous coat was blackish, and
the subjacent cellular tissue injected with black blood; sometimes
there was an appearance of erosion on the surface of the villous coat;
and in the instance of the concentrated acid perforations were found.
In the experiments of Hébréart the lining membrane of the windpipe
was covered with a fibrinous pseudo-membrane, exactly as after
croup.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although acetic acid in its various forms is daily in the hands of
every body, one case only of poisoning with it in the human subject
has hitherto been made public. It is described by MM. Orfila and
Barruel.<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c013'><sup>[384]</sup></a> A girl was seen in a village near Paris at eleven at night
apparently intoxicated. Five hours afterwards she was found lying
on the ground in great agony; and after complaining of pain in the
stomach and experiencing several attacks of convulsions, she expired.
On the subsequent examination of the body considerable
lividity was observed on the skin of the depending parts. The back
of the tongue was brownish and leathery, and the inner membrane of
the gullet blackish-brown, intersected by a fine network of vessels.
The stomach presented internally several large, black, firm elevations,
owing to the injection of coagulated blood into the submucous
cellular tissue; and elsewhere it had a grayish-white tint, with here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>and there a reddish colour; but the mucous membrane was perfectly
entire. The cavity contained above eight ounces of a thick, blackish
fluid; and a thicker pulpy matter of the same colour adhered firmly
to the villous coat. The intestines were healthy, and so also were
the other organs in the belly and chest. The uterus contained a
fœtus two months and a half old. The contents of the stomach were
subjected to a careful analysis by MM. Orfila and Barruel, who found
that they did not contain any appreciable quantity of free sulphuric
or muriatic acid, or of any of the common metallic poisons; and by
the process of analysis formerly described, they succeeded in separating
from the impure mass three drachms of a pure, and tolerably
concentrated acetic acid, besides two drachms more from the contents
of the intestines. As the residue of the distillation left behind in the
retort did not yield any bitter principle to boiling alcohol, so as to
countenance the idea of a vegetable alkaloid having been given
along with the acetic acid, they inferred that this acid had been
swallowed alone; and the experiments of Orfila on dogs, performed
for the occasion, induced them to conclude that it was the cause of
death.</p>

<p class='c006'>To these observations it is only farther necessary to add, that the
concentrated acid is a powerful irritant and even corrosive when applied
externally; which properties are owing to its power of dissolving
many of the soft animal solids.<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c013'><sup>[385]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING WITH OXALIC ACID.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>The last poison of this order is oxalic acid. It is a substance of
very great interest; for it is a poison of great energy, and in this
country is in common use for committing suicide, and has been often
taken by accident for Epsom salt.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is certainly ill adapted for the purposes of the murderer; for
although it might be easily given to a sick person instead of a laxative
salt, yet its real nature would betray itself too soon and too unequivocally
for the chief object of the prisoner,—secrecy. Nevertheless,
attempts of the kind have been made. At the trial of James
Brown for assaulting his wife, held at the Middlesex Autumn Assizes
1827, it was brought out in evidence that he had previously tried to
poison her by giving her oxalic acid in gin;<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c013'><sup>[386]</sup></a> and Mr. Alfred Taylor
says he is acquainted with two similar cases, where an attempt was
made to administer it in tea.<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c013'><sup>[387]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It was first made known as a poison by Mr. Royston in 1814.<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c013'><sup>[388]</sup></a>
Its properties have been examined by Dr. A. T. Thomson of London,<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c013'><sup>[389]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>and Dr. Perey of Lausanne;<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c013'><sup>[390]</sup></a> in 1823, the whole subject of
poisoning with oxalic acid in its medico-legal relations was examined
by Dr. Coindet of Geneva and myself;<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c013'><sup>[391]</sup></a> and in 1828, another experimental
inquiry, which confirms most of the results we obtained,
was published by Dr. Pommer of Heilbronn.<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c013'><sup>[392]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> I.—<i>Of the Tests for Oxalic Acid.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Oxalic acid is commonly in small crystals of the form of flattened
six-sided striated prisms, transparent, colourless, free of odour, very
acid to the taste, and permanent in the air. Two other common vegetable
acids, the citric and tartaric acids, present a totally different crystalline
form. In general appearance it greatly resembles the sulphate of
magnesia, for which it has been so often and so fatally mistaken. So
close, indeed, is the resemblance, that repeatedly, on desiring several
persons to point out which was the poison and which the laxative, I
have found as many fix on the wrong as on the right parcel. The
sulphate of magnesia has of course a very different taste, being
strongly bitter. Various plans have been devised for preventing the
accident to which this unlucky resemblance has given rise. The best
of them imply the use of a safeguard by the patient before he takes
his laxative draught. It seems to have escaped the notice of those
who have proposed the plans in question, that, if accidents are to be
prevented in this manner, by far the simplest and most effectual
security will be to let the public know, that a laxative salt ought
always to be tasted before being swallowed. Its solubility has been
much overrated by some chemists. It does not appear to me soluble
in less than eleven parts of water.</p>

<p class='c006'>In determining the medico-legal tests for oxalic acid, it will be
sufficient to consider it in two states,—dissolved in water,—and
mixed with the contents of the stomach and intestines or vomited
matter. If the substance submitted to examination is in the solid
state, the first step is to convert it into a solution.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. In the form of a pure solution, its nature may be satisfactorily
determined by the following process.</p>

<p class='c006'>The acidity of the fluid is first to be established by its effect on
litmus-paper.—A small portion is next to be tested with ammonia,
which, if the solution of the acid be sufficiently concentrated, will
produce a radiated crystallization, as the oxalate of ammonia formed
is much less soluble than oxalic acid itself. This property, according
to Dr. O’Shaughnessey, distinguishes it from every other acid.<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c013'><sup>[393]</sup></a>
The remainder of the fluid is next to be subjected to the following
reagents.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Hydrochlorate of lime</i> causes a white precipitate, the oxalate of
lime; which is dissolved on the addition of a drop or two of nitric
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>acid,—and is not dissolved when similarly treated with hydrochloric
acid, unless the acid is added in very large proportion.</p>

<p class='c006'>The easy solubility of the oxalate of lime in nitric acid distinguishes
the precipitate from the sulphate of lime, which the present
test might throw down from solutions of the sulphates, and which is
not soluble in a moderate quantity of nitric acid without the aid of
heat. The insolubility of the oxalate of lime in hydrochloric acid
on the other hand distinguishes the precipitate from the tartrate,
citrate, carbonate and phosphate of lime, which the test might throw
down from any solution containing a salt of these acids. The last
four precipitates are redissolved by a drop or two of hydrochloric
acid; but the oxalate is not taken up till a large quantity of that
acid is added.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Sulphate of lime</i> in solution causes a white precipitate with oxalic
acid, and not with any other.<a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c013'><sup>[394]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Sulphate of copper</i> causes a faint bluish-white, or greenish-white
precipitate, which is not redissolved on the addition of a few drops
of hydrochloric acid. The precipitate is the oxalate of copper. It
is redissolved by a large proportion of hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>This test does not precipitate the sulphates, hydrochlorates, nitrates,
tartrates, citrates. But with the carbonates and phosphates
it forms precipitates resembling the oxalate of copper. The oxalate,
however, is distinguished from the carbonate and phosphate of copper
by not being redissolved on the addition of a few drops of hydrochloric
acid.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Nitrate of silver</i> causes a dense, white precipitate, the oxalate of
silver; which, when collected on a filter, dried and heated, becomes
brown on the edge, then fulminates faintly and is dispersed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The object of the supplementary test of fulmination is to distinguish
the oxalate of silver from the numberless other white precipitates
which are thrown down by the nitrate of silver from solutions
of other salts. The property of fulmination, which is very characteristic,
requires, for security’s sake, a word or two of explanation,
in consequence of the effect of heat on the tartrate and citrate of
silver. The citrate when heated becomes altogether brown, froths
up, and then deflagrates, discharging white fumes and leaving an
abundant, ash-gray, coarsely fibrous, crumbly residue, which on the
farther application of heat becomes pure white, being then pure silver.
The tartrate also becomes brown and froths up, but does not
even deflagrate, white fumes are discharged, and there is left behind
a botryoidal mass, which, like the residue from the citrate, becomes
pure silver when heated to redness. Another distinction between the
oxalate and tartrate is that the former continues permanent at the
temperature of ebullition, while the latter becomes brown. The preceding
process or combination of tests will be amply sufficient for
proving the presence of oxalic acid, free or combined, in any fluid,
which does not contain animal or vegetable principles.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The only important modifications in the analysis rendered necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>by the admixture of organic principles, occur in the case of
the contents of the alimentary canal or vomited matters.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Coindet and I proved, that oxalic acid has not any chemical
action with any of the common animal principles except gelatin,
which it rapidly dissolves;—and that this solution is of a peculiar
kind, not being accompanied with any decomposition, either of the
acid or of the gelatin.<a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c013'><sup>[395]</sup></a> Consequently oxalic acid, so far as concerns
the tissues of the stomach or its ordinary contents, is not altered
in chemical form, and remains soluble in water.</p>

<p class='c006'>In such a solution, however, a variety of soluble principles are
contained, which would cause abundant precipitates with two of the
tests of the process,—sulphate of copper and nitrate of silver; so
that the oxalates of these metals could not possibly be detached in
their characteristic forms. The process for a pure solution, therefore,
is inapplicable to the mixtures under consideration.</p>

<p class='c006'>But changes of still greater consequence are effected on the poison
by exhibiting antidotes during life. It is now generally known, that
the proper antidotes for oxalic acid are magnesia and chalk. Each
of these forms an insoluble oxalate; so that if either had been given
in sufficient quantity, no oxalic acid will remain in solution, and the
proofs of the presence of the poison must be sought for in the solid
contents of the stomach or solid matter vomited.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following process for detecting the poison will apply to all
the alterations which it may thus have undergone.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Process for Compound Mixtures.</i>—If chalk or magnesia has not been
given as an antidote, the suspected mixture is to be macerated if necessary
for a few hours in a little distilled water, then filtered, and the filtered
fluid neutralized with carbonate of potass. If on the other
hand chalk or magnesia has been given, the mixture is to be left at
rest for some time, and the supernatant fluid then removed. This
fluid, if not acid, may be thrown away; but if acid, it may be
treated as already directed for a suspected mixture, where chalk or
magnesia has not obtained entrance. After the removal of the supernatant
liquid, pick out as many solid fragments of animal or vegetable
matter as possible; and add as much pure water to the insoluble
residue as will give the mass a sufficiently thin consistence.
Add now to the mixture about a twentieth of its weight of carbonate
of potass, and boil gently for two hours, or till the organic
matter is all dissolved. While dissolution thus takes place, a double
interchange is effected between the elements of the carbonate of
potass on the one hand, and those of the earthy oxalate on the other,
so that an oxalate of potass will at length exist in solution. The
fluid when cold is next to be filtered, then rendered very faintly
acidulous with nitric acid, then filtered and rendered very faintly
alkaline with carbonate of potass, and filtered a third time. At each
of these steps some animal matter will be thrown down.</p>

<p class='c006'>From this point onwards the process proceeds in the same way,
whatever may have been the original form in which the acid existed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>in the mixture; for the oxalate of lime or magnesia in the second
case is converted into oxalate of potass.</p>

<p class='c006'>Add now the solution of acetate of lead to the fluid as long as
any precipitate is formed. Collect the precipitate on a filter, wash
it well, and dry it by compression between folds of bibulous paper.
Remove this precipitate, which consists of oxalate of lead and organic
matter in union with oxide of lead, and rub it up very carefully
while damp with a little water in a mortar. Transmit sulphuretted
hydrogen gas briskly for an hour, so that the whole white precipitate
shall be thoroughly blackened; filter and boil. In this manner
is formed a sulphuret of lead, which retains a great deal of animal
matter; and the oxalic acid being set free, is found in the solution
tolerably pure. Filtration before boiling is an essential point in this
step, to prevent animal matter being dissolved by the water from
the sulphuret of lead. More animal matter may still be separated by
evaporating the liquid to dryness at 212°, keeping it at that temperature
for a few minutes, and redissolving and filtering. The solution
will now exhibit the properties of oxalic acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have found that when this process was applied to a decoction of an
ounce of beef in six ounces of water, with which one grain of anhydrous
oxalic acid had been mixed, all the tests acted characteristically on
the solution ultimately procured. I have farther found, that when
two grains of oxalate of lime, which correspond with one grain of
oxalic acid, were mixed with a similar decoction in which some
fragments of beef were purposely left to complicate the process, a
solution was eventually obtained, which gave with muriate of lime a
white precipitate insoluble in a little muriatic acid, with sulphate of
copper a greenish-white precipitate also insoluble in a little muriatic
acid, and with nitrate of silver a white precipitate which fulminated
and was almost all dispersed, but left a little charcoal, owing to its
containing a small proportion of animal matter. In a case which
lately happened in London, every test acted as here described, except
that the oxalate of lime did not fulminate, owing to the presence
of organic impurities.<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c013'><sup>[396]</sup></a> In order to try the test of fulmination in
such circumstances, it is essential to dry the precipitated oxalate of
silver thoroughly before raising the temperature to the point at which
fulmination usually occurs.</p>

<p class='c006'>The process now recommended is both delicate and accurate.
An objection has been advanced against it,—that acetate of lead
will throw down chloride of lead as well as the oxalate of lead; that
both will subsequently be decomposed by the sulphuretted-hydrogen?
and that the hydrochloric acid thus brought into the solution with
the oxalic acid will be precipitated by the nitrate of silver, and form
a mixture of salts which will not fulminate characteristically.<a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c013'><sup>[397]</sup></a> This
objection is not well founded. Chloride of lead being soluble in
thirty parts of temperate water, it will seldom be thrown down from
such fluids as occur in medico-legal inquiries; and besides it is easily
removed, as I have ascertained, by washing the precipitate with moderate
care on the filter.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>Professor Orfila has advanced another objection,—that the process
will yield all the indications mentioned above, if binoxalate of
potash be present, or sorrel-soup, which contains a little of that salt.<a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c013'><sup>[398]</sup></a>
The objection is valid, were these substances apt to come in the way.
But the binoxalate of potash is not put to any medicinal use in Britain,
and English cookery does not acknowledge the “soupe à l’oseille.”
The process he recommends to meet the difficulty, an important one
in France, is the following: 1. Having made a watery solution as
above, evaporate nearly to dryness, agitate the residue with cold pure
alcohol, repeatedly during a period of several hours; decant the
tincture, and repeat this step with more alcohol; evaporate to obtain
crystals, if possible; dissolve these again in cold pure alcohol, and
crystallize a second time by evaporation. If crystals do not form on
first concentrating the alcoholic solution, evaporate it till a pellicle
begins to form, agitate the residue with cold pure alcohol, and concentrate
again to obtain crystals. Lastly, examine the crystals by
the tests for pure oxalic acid. The object of these steps in the process
is to separate binoxalate of potass, oxalate of magnesia and oxalate
of lime, which, he says, are all either not soluble, or very sparingly
so, in absolute alcohol. 2. More oxalic acid may be got by
acting with distilled water on the matter left by the action of alcohol,
evaporating this watery solution nearly to dryness, agitating the residuum
with cold alcohol as before, and so on. 3. The preceding
operations may have left oxalate of magnesia and oxalate of lime
unacted on by the water among the solids remaining on the filter.
The former compound may be dissolved out by cold hydrochloric
acid diluted with four times its volume of water; and by an excess
of pure carbonate of potass, the oxalate of magnesia in the solution
is converted into insoluble carbonate of magnesia and soluble oxalate
of potass, from which oxalic acid is to be obtained by a salt of lead
and sulphuretted-hydrogen, as explained in my own process. 4.
Oxalate of lime, which may still remain, is to be sought for by boiling
the residuum of the action of hydrochloric acid with solution of
bicarbonate of potash, so as to obtain here also an oxalate of potass
in solution. I have not had an opportunity of trying this method.
But I find, that, contrary to Orfila’s statement, binoxolate of potass,
though sparingly soluble in cold alcohol of the density of 800, is sufficiently
so to vitiate the principle on which the process is founded.</p>

<p class='c006'>Caustic potass must not be used for decomposing oxalate of lime
or magnesia, because the pure alkali, as Gay-Lussac has shown, produces
oxalic acid in acting on animal substances at a boiling temperature.
Carbonate of potass has no such effect.</p>

<p class='c006'>The discovery of oxalic acid in the form of oxalate of lime in the
stomach or vomited matter is exposed to a singular fallacy, if a material
quantity of rhubarb has been taken recently before death, or
before the discharge of the vomited matter. For according to the
researches of M. Henry of Paris, rhubarb root always contains some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>oxalate of lime, and some samples yield so much as 30 and even 33
per cent.<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c013'><sup>[399]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> II.—<i>On the Action of Oxalic Acid and the Symptoms it causes in Man.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The action of oxalic acid on the animal economy is very peculiar.</p>

<p class='c006'>When injected in a state of concentration into the stomach of a
dog or cat, it causes exquisite pain, expressed by cries and struggling.
In a few minutes this is succeeded by violent efforts to vomit; then
by sudden dulness, languor, and great debility; and death soon takes
place without a struggle. The period which elapses before death
varies from two to twenty minutes, when the dose is considerable,—half
an ounce, for example. After death the stomach is found to contain
black extravasated blood, exactly like blood acted on by oxalic
acid out of the body; the inner coat of the stomach is of a cherry-red
colour, with streaks of black granular warty extravasation; and
in some places the surface of the coat is very brittle and the subjacent
stratum gelatinized, evidently by the chemical action of the poison.<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c013'><sup>[400]</sup></a>
If the stomach is examined immediately after death, little corrosion
will be found, compared with what is seen if the inspection be delayed
a day or two.<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c013'><sup>[401]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Such are the effects of the concentrated acid. When considerably
diluted, the phenomena are totally different. When dissolved in
twenty parts of water, oxalic acid, like the mineral acids in the
same circumstances, cease to corrode; nay it hardly even irritates.
But, unlike them, it continues a deadly poison; for it causes death
by acting indirectly on the brain, spine, and heart. The symptoms
then induced vary with the dose. When the quantity is large, the
most prominent symptoms are those of palsy of the heart; and immediately
after death that organ is found to have lost its contractility,
and to contain arterial blood in its left cavities. When the dose is
less the animal perishes after several fits of violent tetanus, which affects
the respiratory muscles of the chest in particular, causing spasmodic
fixing of the chest and consequent suffocation. When the
dose is still less, the spasms are slight or altogether wanting, and
death occurs under symptoms of pure narcotism like those caused by
opium: the animal appears to sleep away.</p>

<p class='c006'>This poison acts with violence, and produces nearly the same
effects to whatever texture of the body it is applied. It causes death
with great rapidity when injected into the sac of the peritonæum, or
into that of the pleura; it acts with still greater quickness when injected
into a vein; and it also acts when injected into the cellular
tissue beneath the skin, but with much less celerity than through any
other channel. Eight grains injected into the jugular vein of a dog
occasioned almost immediate death: Thirty-three grains injected
into the pleura killed another in twelve minutes. The same quantity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>did not prove fatal, though it caused violent effects, when retained
in the stomach by a ligature on the gullet. One hundred and
sixty grains injected under the skin of the thigh and belly did not
prove fatal for about ten hours. The symptoms were nearly the same
in every case.<a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c013'><sup>[402]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It is probable from the facts now stated, that oxalic acid, when not
sufficiently concentrated to occasion death by the local injury produced,
acts on the nervous system through the medium of the blood.
Nevertheless it is a remarkable circumstance that it cannot be detected
in that fluid. Mention has already been made of an experiment performed
by Dr. Coindet and myself (p. <a href='#Page_22'>22</a>), where even after the injection
of eight grains of oxalic acid into the femoral vein, and the
consequent death of the animal in thirty seconds, none of the poison
could be detected in the blood of the iliac vein or vena cava. Similar
results have been more lately obtained by Dr. Pommer. In dogs
killed by the gradual injection of from five to thirty grains into the
femoral vein, he never could detect the poison in the blood of the
right side of the heart or great veins, except in the instance of the
largest doses, where a little could be detected near the opening in
the vein. Dr. Pommer’s experiments likewise agree with those of
Dr. Coindet and myself as to the absence of any change in the
physical qualities of the blood.<a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c013'><sup>[403]</sup></a> When to these circumstances it is
added that very small quantities of oxalic acid may be detected in
blood, into which it has been introduced immediately after removal
from the body by venesection, it appears reasonable to conclude that
the poison is quickly decomposed in the blood by vital operations.</p>

<p class='c006'>According to Orfila, however, it may be detected in the urine, in
which crystals of oxalate of lime form on cooling, and more may be
obtained on the addition of hydrochlorate of lime. Yet he could not
detect any oxalic acid in the liver or spleen.<a id='r404' /><a href='#f404' class='c013'><sup>[404]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In man the most prominent symptoms hitherto observed have been
those of excessive irritation, because it has been almost always swallowed
in a large dose and much concentrated.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is the most rapid and unerring of all the common poisons. The
London Courier contains an inquest on the body of a young man who
appears to have survived hardly ten minutes;<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c013'><sup>[405]</sup></a> an equally rapid case
of a young lady, who poisoned herself with an ounce, is mentioned in
the St. James’s Chronicle;<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c013'><sup>[406]</sup></a> and few of those who have died survived
above an hour. This rule, however, is by no means without exception.
Mr. Hebb has described a case which did not prove
fatal for thirteen hours;<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c013'><sup>[407]</sup></a> Dr. Arrowsmith of Coventry has favoured
me with the particulars of a very interesting case which lasted for the
same period: and Mr. Frazer has accurately described another, in
which, after the patient seemed to be doing tolerably well, an exhausting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>fever, with dyspepsia and singultus, carried him off in twenty-three
days.<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c013'><sup>[408]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Among the fatal cases the smallest dose has been half an ounce;
but there can be little doubt that less would be sufficient to cause
death. Dr. Babington of Coleraine has published a case where very
severe effects were produced by only two scruples.<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c013'><sup>[409]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Very few persons have recovered where the quantity was considerable.</p>

<p class='c006'>In every instance in which the dose was considerable, and the
solution concentrated, the first symptoms have been immediate burning
pain in the stomach, and generally also in the throat. But when
the dose was small, more particularly if the solution was also rather
diluted, the pain has sometimes been slight, or slow in commencing.
Mr. Hebb’s patient, who took only half an ounce dissolved in ten
parts of water, and diluted it immediately after with copious draughts
of water, had not any pain in the belly for six hours.</p>

<p class='c006'>In general, violent vomiting follows the accession of pain, either
immediately, or in a few minutes; and it commonly continues till
near death. Some, however, have not vomited at all, even when
the acid was strong and in a large dose; and this is still more apt to
happen when the poison has been taken much diluted. The man
last mentioned did not vomit at all for seven hours, except when
emetics were administered. The vomited matter, as in this man’s
case, and in that of Mr. Frazer’s patient, is sometimes bloody. Instant
discharge of the poison by vomiting does not always save the
patient’s life: A woman who swallowed two ounces died in twenty
minutes, although she vomited almost immediately after taking the
poison.<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c013'><sup>[410]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The tongue and mouth occasionally become inflamed if the case
lasts long enough. In an instance of recovery, which happened not
long ago in St. Thomas’s Hospital, London, the tongue was red,
swollen, tense and tender, the day after the acid was swallowed.<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c013'><sup>[411]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Death commonly takes place so soon, that the bowels are seldom
much affected. But when life is prolonged a few hours, they are
evidently much irritated. Dr. Arrowsmith’s patient, who lived thirteen
hours, had severe pain in the bowels and frequent inclination to
go to stool, and Mr. Hebb’s patient, who also lived thirteen hours,
had a constant, involuntary discharge of fluid fæces, occasionally
mixed with blood. Bloody diarrhœa is very common in dogs.</p>

<p class='c006'>The signs of depressed circulation are always very striking. In
general the pulse fails altogether, it is always very feeble, and the
skin is cold and clammy. Contrary to the general fact, however, I
once remarked in a dog the pulsation of the heart so strong as to be
audible at a distance of several yards.</p>

<p class='c006'>In some cases nervous symptoms have occurred, but in none so
distinctly as in animals that have taken the diluted acid. It should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>be remarked, however, that few published cases contain good histories
of the symptoms; since they commonly come to an end before
being seen by the physician. Convulsions appear to have occurred
in some instances either at the time of death or soon before it. In
the slower cases various nervous affections have been observed. A
girl, who swallowed by mistake about two drachms, and did not
vomit till emetics were given, complained much at first of pain, but
afterwards chiefly of great lassitude and weakness of the limbs, and
next morning of numbness and weakness there as well as in the back.
This affection was at first so severe that she could hardly walk up
stairs; but in a few days she recovered entirely.<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c013'><sup>[412]</sup></a> Analogous effects
took place in Mr. Hebb’s patient and in Dr. Arrowsmith’s case.
The first thing the former complained of was acute pain in the back,
gradually extending down the thighs, occasioning ere long great torture,
and continuing almost till the moment of death. Dr. Arrowsmith’s
patient had the same symptoms, complained more of the pain
shooting down from the loins to the limbs than of the pain in the belly,
and was constantly seeking relief in a fresh change of posture. Mr.
Frazer’s patient had from an early period a peculiar general numbness,
approaching to palsy. Dr. Babington’s patient, who took two scruples
by mistake for tartaric acid in an effervescing draught, suffered,
after the first twenty-four hours, chiefly from headache, extreme feebleness
of the pulse, and a sense of numbness and tingling or pricking
in the back and thighs. In a recent case described by Mr. Tapson,
which occurred in London, and where it was supposed, but on
insufficient grounds,<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c013'><sup>[413]</sup></a> that so much as two ounces had been taken,
violent symptoms of irritation in the alimentary canal came on as
usual, but soon afterwards a sense as if the hands were dead, loss of
consciousness for eight hours, and then lividity, coldness, and almost
complete loss of the power of motion in the legs; which symptoms
were not entirely removed for fifteen days. In a case related by Mr.
Alfred Taylor, where death was caused by seven drachms in fifteen
or twenty minutes, there was first violent vomiting, then severe pain
in the stomach, and finally clammy perspiration and convulsions,
with two or three deep inspirations before death.<a id='r414' /><a href='#f414' class='c013'><sup>[414]</sup></a> The effects in
this case came very near those generally observed in animals.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Dr. Arrowsmith’s case two symptoms occurred, which I have
not seen mentioned in any other. The first was an eruption or mottled
appearance of the skin in circular patches, not unlike the roundish
red marks on the arms of stout healthy children, but of a deeper
tint. The second was the poisoning and death of leeches applied to
the stomach. “They were healthy,” says Dr. Arrowsmith in the
notes with which he obligingly furnished me, “small, and fastened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>immediately. On looking at them in a few minutes I remarked that
they did not seem to fill, and on touching one it felt hard and immediately
fell off, motionless and dead. The others were all in the
same state. They had all bitten and the marks were conspicuous;
but they had drawn scarcely any blood. They were applied about
six hours after the acid was taken.” This curious fact illustrates the
observations formerly quoted from Vernière’s experiments [p. <a href='#Page_67'>67</a>].
It will be observed that the leeches were applied several hours after
the poison was swallowed, and in a case in which the acid was
largely diluted in the stomach;—so that it might have entered the
blood and been diffused throughout the body before the observation
was made.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> III.—<i>Of the Morbid Appearances caused by Oxalic Acid.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The external appearance of the body is commonly natural. In one
instance the cellular tissue was distended with gases ten hours after
death.<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c013'><sup>[415]</sup></a> Violent marks of irritation have been commonly found in
the stomach; and sometimes that organ has been even perforated.<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c013'><sup>[416]</sup></a>
It is probable that the extensive destruction of the coats noticed by
some authors has taken place in part after death from the action of
the acid on the dead tissues.—The usual conjunction of morbid appearances
is well described by Mr. Hebb. The mucous coat of the
throat and gullet looked as if it had been scalded, and that of the
gullet could be easily scratched off. The stomach contained a pint
of thick fluid. This is commonly dark, like coffee-grounds, as it
contains a good deal of blood. The inner coat of the stomach was
pulpy, in many points black, in others red. The inner membrane of
the intestines was similarly but less violently affected. The outer
coat of both stomach and intestines was inflamed. The lining membrane
of the windpipe was also very red.—The appearances have
also been excellently described in the case published by Mr. Alfred
Taylor. The inside of the gullet was pale, as if boiled, strongly
corrugated and brittle, and covering a ramification of vessels filled
with consolidated blood. The stomach presented externally numerous
vessels in the same state; and its villous coat was pale, soft,
brittle, but here and there injected with vessels. The duodenum and
part of the jejunum were red, the other intestines natural, the liver,
spleen, and kidneys congested. The stomach contained a brownish
jelly, in which gelatin was detected, as well as oxalic acid. The
blood was fluid every where except in the vessels of the gullet and
stomach.<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c013'><sup>[417]</sup></a> The consolidated condition of the blood there was evidently
owing to the local action of a strong acid, and is the same
with what has been observed in poisoning with the mineral acids.—In
Mr. Frazer’s patient the whole villous coat of the stomach was
either softened or removed, as well as the inner membrane of the
gullet, so that the muscular coat was exposed; and this coat presented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>a dark gangrenous-like appearance, being much thickened and highly
injected.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although these signs of violent irritation are commonly present, it
must at the same time be observed, that some cases have occurred
where the stomach and intestines were quite healthy. In a girl who
died about thirty minutes after swallowing an ounce of the acid, no
morbid appearance whatsoever was to be seen in any part of the alimentary
canal.<a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c013'><sup>[418]</sup></a> In the case of a girl, described by Mr. Anderson,
where death took place in twenty minutes, there was no appearance
but contraction of the rugæ of the gullet and stomach, one spot of
extravasation in the latter and doubtful softening of its villous coat.<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c013'><sup>[419]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The state of the other organs of the body has not been taken notice
of in published cases. In several instances, as in Mr. Taylor’s case,
the blood in the veins of the stomach is described as having been
black and as it were charred; probably by the chemical action of the
acid after death.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> IV.—<i>Of the Treatment of Poisoning with Oxalic Acid.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The chief part of the treatment of this kind of poisoning is obvious.
On account of its dreadful rapidity, remedies cannot be of
material use unless they are resorted to immediately after the acid
has been swallowed. Emetics may be given, if vomiting is not
already free; but time should never be lost in administering them
if an antidote is at hand. In particular it is necessary to avoid
giving warm water with a view to accelerate vomiting, unless it is
given very largely; for moderate dilution will promote the entrance
of the poison into the blood, if it has not the effect of immediately
expelling it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The principal object of the practitioner should be to administer as
speedily as possible large doses of magnesia or chalk suspended in
water. Chalk has been given with great advantage in several cases,<a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c013'><sup>[420]</sup></a>
and magnesia has also been of service.<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c013'><sup>[421]</sup></a> As no time should be lost,
the plaster of the apartment may be resorted to, when chalk or magnesia
is not at hand. These substances not only neutralize the acid
so as to take away its corrosive power, but likewise render it insoluble,
so as to prevent it from entering the blood. There appears no
particular reason for using the stomach-pump when antidotes are at
hand. But fashion seems to have authorised the employment of
this instrument for every kind of poison.<a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c013'><sup>[422]</sup></a> Alkalis are inadmissible.
As might be inferred from the general statements formerly made on
the effect of chemical changes on poisons [p. <a href='#Page_28'>28</a>], the alkalis, as
they form only soluble salts, will not deprive oxalic acid of its remote
or indirect action; and instances are not wanting of their inutility in
actual practice.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Oxalic acid is one of the poisons alluded to under the head of
General Poisoning,—of whose operation distinct evidence may sometimes
(though certainly not always) be found in the symptoms. If a
person, immediately after swallowing a solution of a crystalline salt,
which tasted purely and strongly acid, is attacked with burning in the
throat, then with burning in the stomach, vomiting particularly of
bloody matter, imperceptible pulse and excessive languor, and dies
in half an hour, or still more in twenty, fifteen, or ten minutes, I do
not know any fallacy which can interfere with the conclusion, that
oxalic acid was the cause of death. No parallel disease begins so
abruptly and terminates so soon; and no other crystalline poison
has the same effects.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Poisoning with the Oxalates.</i>—Oxalic acid is one of the best examples
of a poison that acts through all its soluble chemical combinations.
Dr. Coindet and I found that the oxalates of potash and ammonia
are little inferior in energy to the acid. They do not corrode,
indeed, and scarcely ever irritate; but they produce tetanus and coma,
like the diluted acid. Half a drachm of oxalic acid neutralized
with potass will kill a rabbit in seventeen minutes; ninety grains of
neutral oxalate of ammonia will kill a strong cat in nine minutes.<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c013'><sup>[423]</sup></a>
The binoxalate of potash, the most familiar of the salts of oxalic acid,
was not tried by us. But the preceding facts would leave little
doubt of its being a poison.</p>

<p class='c006'>Since the last edition of this work was published several cases
have occurred which amply confirm the results of experimental inquiry.
In Dr. Babington’s case alluded to above, the greater part of the
oxalic acid had been neutralized by bicarbonate of soda [p. <a href='#Page_176'>176</a>].—Mr.
Tripier has communicated the particulars of a case in which
half an ounce of the binoxalate of potash was taken by mistake for
bitartrate of potash in hot water, and caused death in eight minutes, after
an attack of violent pain and convulsions.<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c013'><sup>[424]</sup></a>—A young woman at Bordeaux
was attacked with frequent vomiting after a dose of a drachm and
a half of the same salt dissolved in a ptisane. Next morning a similar
dose caused bloody vomiting and acute pain at the pit of the stomach;
and a third dose the following day excited delirium, more violent
vomiting, and death in the course of an hour.<a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c013'><sup>[425]</sup></a>—A girl in London
swallowed about an ounce of the same salt dissolved in hot water.
Sickness and faintness ensued, with imperceptible pulse, cold, clammy
skin, rigors, scalding of the mouth and throat, pain in the back,
soreness of the eyes, redness of the conjunctivæ, and dilatation of
the pupils. Afterwards there was reaction, with a full frequent pulse,
hot skin, flushed countenance, headache, thirst, and tenderness of
the abdomen. She recovered under the use of chalk, external heat,
ether and opium draughts, leeches and sinapisms to the belly, and
carbonate of ammonia.<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c013'><sup>[426]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>No account has yet been published of the morbid appearances in
man.</p>

<p class='c006'>The proper antidote is sulphate of magnesia. Failing this, weak
milk of lime may be given with advantage.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Appendix on Tartaric and Citric Acid.</i>—These two acids may be
taken in considerable quantities without injury. Dr. Coindet and I
gave a drachm of each in solution to cats, without observing that
the animals suffered any inconvenience.<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c013'><sup>[427]</sup></a> Dr. Sibbald, a surgeon of
this place, has informed me of an instance in which a patient of his
took in twenty-four hours six drachms of tartaric acid, having by
mistake omitted the carbonate of potass sent along with the acid to
make effervescing draughts; and yet he did not suffer any
more inconvenience then the cats on which Dr. Coindet and I
experimented.</p>

<p class='c006'>Pommer, however, found that tartaric acid is scarcely less active
than oxalic acid when injected into the blood. When fifteen grains
dissolved in half an ounce of water were injected into the femoral
vein of a dog in four doses, difficult breathing and discharge of fæces
and urine were produced after each operation, and death speedily
ensued without any other particular symptom. As in the instance of
oxalic acid, the blood in the great veins was not apparently changed
in any of its physical qualities. The heart continued contractile long
after death, while in the case of oxalic acid its contractility was suddenly
extinguished.<a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c013'><sup>[428]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <span class='small'>OF THE ALKALIS AND ALKALINE SALTS.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>The second order of the class of irritants comprehends the alkalis,
some of the alkaline salts, and lime. The species which it includes
are little allied to one another except in chemical composition; and
in particular they are little allied in physiological properties. It appears
impossible, however, to make a better arrangement than that
proposed by Orfila, which will therefore be here followed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Most of the poisons of the second order are powerful local irritants.
Some of them likewise act indirectly on distant organs; and
a few are more distinguished by their remote than by their local effects.
This order may be conveniently divided into two groups,—the one
embracing the two fixed alkalis with their carbonates, nitrates, and
chlorides, and also lime,—the other ammonia, with its salts, and likewise
the alkaline sulphurets.</p>

<p class='c006'>The action of the first group is purely irritant and strictly local.
When concentrated, the fixed alkalis and their carbonates produce
chemical decomposition, softening the animal tissues, and reducing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>them eventually to a pulpy mass; which change depends on their
possessing the power, as chemical agents, of dissolving almost all the
soft solids of the body. When much diluted, they produce inflammation,
without corroding the textures; and it does not appear that
they are even then absorbed in such quantity as to prove injurious to
any remote organ. The action of the alkaline nitrates and of lime is
that of irritants only; at least their chemical action is obscure and
feeble.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of the Fixed Alkalis and their Carbonates.</i></h4>

<h4 class='c011'><i>Section</i> I.—<i>Of their Tests.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'><i>Potass</i> in its caustic state, as usually met with in the shops, forms
little gray-coloured cylinders or cakes which have a radiated, crystalline
fracture, and an excessively acrid caustic taste, and feel soapy
if touched with the wet finger. It deliquesces rapidly in moist air,
and then attracts carbonic acid from the atmosphere. It is easily fused
by heat, and is exceedingly soluble in water. The solution has a
strong alkaline reaction on vegetable colours, restoring reddened
litmus to blue, turning syrup of violets or infusion or red cabbage to
green, and rendering infusion of turmeric brown. It is distinguished
from the alkaline earths when in solution, by not precipitating with
carbonic or sulphuric acid, and from soda by the tests to be presently
mentioned for its carbonate.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Carbonate of potash</i> [subcarbonate, salt of tartar], is usually sold,
when pure, in small white grains, formed by melting the salt and
stirring it rapidly as it cools. In its impure state it is called in this
country potashes, and when somewhat purified, pearl ash. It has
then a mixed grayish, yellowish, or bluish colour, and is sold in
crumbly lumps of various sizes. In every state it is deliquescent
and very caustic. It cannot be crystallized. It gives out carbonic
acid gas with the addition of any stronger acid, such as sulphuric,
muriatic, or acetic acid. Its solution precipitates yellow with the
chloride of platinum, gives a crystalline precipitate with perchloric
acid, when the salt forms not less than a fortieth or fiftieth part,—is
similarly acted on by a considerable excess of tartaric acid, if the
salt constitute about a thirtieth of the fluid,—and yields with the
soluble salts of baryta a white precipitate soluble in nitric acid.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Soda</i> resembles potass closely in chemical as well as physiological
properties; and the <i>carbonate</i> bears the same resemblance to the carbonate
of potass. The chief differences are the following. The carbonate
of soda is easily crystallized, and effloresces on exposure
to the air. A solution in twenty parts of water yields no precipitate
with either perchloric acid or an excess of tartaric acid, because there
is no sparingly soluble perchlorate or bitartrate, as in the case of
potash. Its solution is precipitated by antimoniate of potash, because
the antimoniate of soda is very sparingly soluble. All its salts
remain unaffected by the chloride of platinum, because their base
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>cannot form like potass an insoluble triple salt with the reagent. The
acetate of soda is permanent in the air, while the acetate of potass is
one of the most deliquescent salts known. In trying this last test,
which is very characteristic, care must be taken to avoid an excess
of acid in the acetate of soda by expelling it at a temperature of
212°, otherwise the salt is as deliquescent as the acetate of potass.—Another
difference is, that the chloride of sodium, being nearly
as soluble in temperate as in boiling water, crystallizes with difficulty
and but sparingly by cooling a concentrated boiling solution; while
the chloride of potassium is much more soluble in hot than in cold
water, and crystallizes easily and abundantly when a concentrated
boiling solution is cooled down.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Process for Potash and its Carbonate in Organic Mixtures.</i>—The
following method has been lately recommended for the detection of
potash and its carbonate in complex organic mixtures. Ascertain
that the mixture is alkaline in its action on litmus-paper and turmeric-paper,
and that it is not ammoniacal in odour. Distil to one-third;
ascertain that it has still an alkaline reaction, and evaporate
to dryness in a porcelain basin. Agitate the residue, when cold,
with absolute alcohol; boil, pour off the liquor, and filter it while
hot. Repeat this with the residuum and more alcohol. Distil
off most of the alcohol, and evaporate to dryness. Raise the heat
to char the residuum, continue the heat as long as vapours come off,
remove the charcoaly matter, and incinerate it for forty-five minutes
in a silver crucible. Try to separate potash from what remains by
means of absolute alcohol; and if this do not succeed, remove carbonate
of potash by boiling water. In either case search for potash
by litmus-paper, turmeric-paper, chloride of platinum, and perchloric
acid.<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c013'><sup>[429]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The conclusiveness of this process depends upon the fact, that absolute
alcohol cannot dissolve from solid organic substances such a
proportion of lactate, tartrate, acetate, sulphate, or phosphate of
potash, or chloride of potassium, as to be acted on by chloride of platinum
or perchloric acid.<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c013'><sup>[430]</sup></a>—It is to be observed that carbonate of
potash singly is insoluble in absolute alcohol; but it becomes soluble
in that fluid, when it is conjoined with various organic matters.
Hence it is that this process, intended fundamentally for caustic
potash alone, is applicable to carbonate of potash also.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Process for Soda and its Carbonate in Organic Mixtures.</i>—These
substances may be separated by the method just described for potash.
If the alcoholic solution of the extract of the suspected matter be
alkaline in its action on litmus, and be afterwards found to contain
soda or its carbonate, the evidence of these substances having been
derived from without is satisfactory, because the carbonate of soda
contained in many animal matters cannot be so detached. But if no
indications of the presence of soda be thus obtained, it is not enough
that soda be found in the alcoholic solution of the incinerated alcoholic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>extract, because the natural carbonate of soda of animal matter
may be separated in that manner.<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c013'><sup>[431]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> II.—<i>Of the Action of the fixed Alkalis, and the Symptoms they cause in Man.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The action of the two fixed alkalis and their carbonates on the
animal system is so nearly the same, that the facts which have been
ascertained in respect to one of them will apply to all the rest. The
operation of potass and its carbonate has been carefully investigated
by Professor Orfila,<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c013'><sup>[432]</sup></a> and by M. Bretonneau of Tours.<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c013'><sup>[433]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>When caustic potass is injected in minute portions into the veins,
it instantly coagulates the blood. Five grains, according to Orfila,
will in this way kill a dog in two minutes. But when small doses
either of potash itself, or its carbonate, or indeed any of its salts are
used, Mr. Blake found, that without coagulating the blood, they
arrested the action of the heart in ten seconds, if injected into the
jugular vein; and that when they were injected into the carotid
artery, they occasioned in four seconds signs of great obstruction in
the capillary circulation, and arrestment of the heart’s action in
thirty-five minutes, through means of this effect. Next to the salts
of baryta he thought the potash salts the most powerful on the heart’s
action of all those he tried.<a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c013'><sup>[434]</sup></a> When introduced into the stomach
potash acts powerfully as an irritant, and generally corrodes the coats
of that organ. Thirty-two grains given by Orfila to a dog caused
pain in the gullet, violent vomiting, much anguish, restlessness, and
death on the third day. On dissection he found the inner coat of the
gullet and stomach black and red; and near the pylorus there was a
perforation three-quarters of an inch wide, and surrounded by a hard,
elevated margin. The observations of Bretonneau are in some
respects different. When potass was swallowed by dogs in the dose
of 40 grains, he found that the animals, after suffering for some time
from violent vomiting, always died sooner or later of wasting and exhaustion;
and that the action of the poison was confined chiefly to the
gullet, which was extensively destroyed and ulcerated on its inner
surface. But when the gullet was defended by the potass being
passed at once into the stomach in a caustic holder, larger doses,
even several times repeated, did not prove fatal. The usual violent
symptoms of irritation prevailed for two or three days; but on these
subsiding, the animals rapidly recovered their appetite and playfulness,
appearing in fact to be restored to perfect health. Yet there
could be no doubt that the stomach all the while was severely injured;
for in some of the animals, which were strangled for the sake
of examination several weeks after they took the poison, the villous
coat was found extensively removed, and even the muscular and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>peritonæal coats were here and there destroyed and cicatrized. Bretonneau
farther adds, that ten or fifteen grains introduced into the
rectum caused death sooner than three times as much given by the
mouth.</p>

<p class='c006'>The carbonate of potass possesses properties similar in kind, but inferior
in degree to those of the caustic alkali. Two drachms given
by Orfila to a dog killed it in twenty-five minutes, violent vomiting
and great agony having preceded death. The stomach was universally
of a deep-red colour on its inner surface.</p>

<p class='c006'>Potash and its carbonate are absorbed in the course of their action,
and may be detected by Orfila’s process in the liver, kidneys, and
urine.<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c013'><sup>[435]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The actions of soda and its carbonate seem on the whole the same
with those of potash; but they are not so energetic. In one respect
however soda and its salts differ most materially from those of potash.
For while the latter, when admitted directly into a vein, act by arresting
the action of the heart, soda and its salts, according to the inquiries
of Mr. Blake, have no such effect, but cause death by obstructing
the circulation of the pulmonary capillaries, and preventing
the return of blood from the lungs to the left side of the heart.
This conclusion seems to flow from the following facts. The respiration
becomes in a few seconds laborious and soon ceases, whilst the
heart continues to beat vigorously: arterial pressure is greatly reduced,
while venous pressure is much increased owing to accumulation
of blood in the right side of the heart: after death the lungs
are found congested and often full of froth: and the heart continues
contractile, very turgid in the right side, but quite empty of blood in
its left cavities.<a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c013'><sup>[436]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Poisoning with the caustic alkalis is rare. In 1842, a lady suffering
from inflammation of the bowels took an ounce of solution of
potass by mistake for kali-water, or a solution of bicarbonate of
potash surcharged with carbonic acid. She suffered severely at the
time, and died in a fortnight, probably of the conjunct effects of her
disease and the poison.<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c013'><sup>[437]</sup></a> This is the only case I have found in print
of poisoning with a caustic alkali. But the effects of their carbonates
have been several times witnessed, and appear to resemble closely
those of the concentrated mineral acids.</p>

<p class='c006'>The symptoms are in the first instance an acrid burning taste, and
rapid destruction of the lining membrane of the mouth; then burning
and often constriction in the throat and gullet, with difficult
and painful deglutition; violent vomiting, often sanguinolent, and
tinging vegetable blues green; next acute pain in the stomach and
tenderness of the whole belly; subsequently cold sweats, excessive
weakness, hiccup, tremors and twitches of the extremities; and ere
long violent colic pains, with purging of bloody stools and dark
membranous flakes. So far the symptoms are nearly the same in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>all cases; but in their subsequent course several varieties may be
noticed.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the worst form of poisoning death ensues at an early period, for
example within twenty-four hours, nay even before time enough has
elapsed for diarrhœa to begin. A case of this kind, which has been
very well described by Mr. Dewar of Dunfermline, and which arose
from the patient, a boy, having accidentally swallowed about three
ounces of a strong solution of carbonate of potass, proved fatal in
twelve hours only.<a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c013'><sup>[438]</sup></a> Here death was owing to the general system or
some vital organ being affected through sympathy by the injury sustained
by the alimentary canal.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the mildest form, as in a case related by Plenck<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c013'><sup>[439]</sup></a> of a man who
swallowed an ounce of the carbonate of potass, the symptoms represent
pretty nearly an attack of acute gastritis when followed by recovery,—the
effects on man being then analogous to those observed
by Bretonneau in animals, when the poison was introduced into the
stomach without touching the gullet.</p>

<p class='c006'>But a more common form than either of the preceding is one, similar
to the chronic form of poisoning with the mineral acids, in which
constant vomiting of food and drink, incessant discharge of fluid,
sanguinolent stools, difficulty of swallowing, burning pain from the
mouth to the anus, and rapid emaciation, continue for weeks or even
months before the patient’s strength is exhausted; and where death
is evidently owing to starvation, the alimentary canal being no longer
capable of assimilating food. Two characteristic examples of this
singular affection have been recorded in the Medical Repository,<a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c013'><sup>[440]</sup></a>
and a third, of which the event has not been mentioned, but which
would in all likelihood end fatally, has been communicated by M. Jules
Cloquet to Orfila.<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c013'><sup>[441]</sup></a> Of the two first cases, which were caused by half an
ounce of carbonate of potass having been taken in solution by mistake
for a laxative salt, one proved fatal in little more than a month, the
other three weeks afterwards. In Cloquet’s case, at the end of the
sixth week the membrane of the mouth was regenerated; but the
gullet continued to discharge pus, and the stools were purulent and
bloody.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another form perhaps equally common with that just described,
and not less certainly fatal, commences like the rest with violent
symptoms of irritation in the mouth, gullet, and stomach; but the
bowels are not affected, and by and by it becomes apparent that the
stomach is little injured; dysphagia or even complete inability to
swallow, burning pain and constriction in the gullet, hawking and
coughing of tough, leathery flakes, are then the leading symptoms; at
length the case becomes one of stricture of the œsophagus with or without
ulceration; the bougie gives only temporary relief, and the patient
eventually expires either of mere starvation, or of that combined
with an exhausting fever. Mr. Dewar has related a very striking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>example of this form of poisoning with the alkalis.<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c013'><sup>[442]</sup></a> His patient,
after the first violent symptoms had exhausted themselves, which
took place in sixteen or eighteen hours, suffered little for four or five
days till the sloughs began to separate from the lining membrane of
the mouth, throat, and gullet. The affection of the gullet then became
gradually predominant, and terminated in stricture, of which
she appears to have been several times so much relieved as to have
been thought in a fair way of recovery. After repeatedly disappointing
Mr. Dewar’s hopes of a successful issue by her intemperance in
the use of spirituous liquors, she died of starvation about four months
after swallowing the poison. Sir Charles Bell has noticed three
parallel cases, and has given delineations of the appearance in the
gullet of two of them.<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c013'><sup>[443]</sup></a> One of his patients did not die till twenty
years after swallowing the poison, which in this instance was soap-less;
yet he does not hesitate to ascribe the stricture to that cause,
and says death arose purely from starvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The carbonate of soda, though a salt in very common use, has not
hitherto been the cause of accident, which has found its way into
print. It is plainly much less actively corrosive than carbonate of
potass, and is therefore probably in every sense less energetic.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> III.—<i>Of the Morbid Appearances caused by the fixed Alkalis.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The morbid appearances caused by potass, soda, and their carbonates
differ with the nature of the case.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the boy who died in twelve hours Mr. Dewar found the inner
membrane of the throat and gullet almost entirely disorganized and
reduced to a pulp, with blood extravasated between it and the muscular
coat. The inner coat of the stomach was red, in two round
patches destroyed, and the patches covered with a clot of blood;—its
outer coat, as well as all the other abdominal viscera, was sound.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the two chronic cases mentioned in the Medical Repository the
mischief was much more general, the whole peritonæum being condensed,
the omentum dark and turgid, the intestines glued together
by lymph, the external coats of the stomach thick, the villous coat
almost all destroyed, what remained of it red and near the pylorus
ulcerated, and the pyloric orifice of the stomach plugged up with
lymph so as barely to admit a small probe.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Mr. Dewar’s patient who died of stricture of the gullet the intestines
were sound, the inner surface of the stomach red especially
towards the cardia, the inner and muscular coats of the gullet thickened
and firmly incorporated together by effused lymph, the inner
coat here and there wanting, the passage of the gullet every where
contracted, and to such a degree about two inches above the cardia
as hardly to pass a common probe. In Sir C. Bell’s cases the appearances
were similar.</p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila says he is led to conclude from a great number of facts that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>of all corrosive poisons potass is the one which most frequently perforates
the stomach.<a id='r444' /><a href='#f444' class='c013'><sup>[444]</sup></a> This appearance, however, has not been
mentioned in any case of poisoning in the human subject.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> IV.—<i>Of the Treatment of Poisoning with the fixed Alkalis.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>In the treatment of poisoning with the alkalis the first object is
evidently to neutralize the poison. This may be done either with a
weak acid, or with oil. Of the acids the acetic in the form of vinegar
is most generally recommended, as it is not itself injurious. A successful
case in very unpromising circumstances, where two ounces
and a half of carbonate of potash had been taken by mistake for cream
of tartar, and where the antidote was not administered for half an
hour, has been related by M. Liégard of Caen. Great relief was
experienced to the burning in the throat and stomach, the chilliness,
difficult breathing, and frequent efforts to vomit, which were the first
symptoms; and after repeated alternations of collapse and reaction,
convalescence was established in eight days.<a id='r445' /><a href='#f445' class='c013'><sup>[445]</sup></a>—M. Chereau thinks
that for the mineral alkalis and their carbonates fixed oil is a preferable
antidote to vinegar; and he has given the heads of two cases
of poisoning with large doses of carbonate of potass, in which the
free employment of almond oil prevented the usual fatal consequences.
It appears to act partly by rendering the vomiting free and easy,
partly by converting the alkali into a soap. It must be given in
large quantity, several pounds being commonly required.<a id='r446' /><a href='#f446' class='c013'><sup>[446]</sup></a> For the
subsequent treatment the reader may consult the paper of Mr. Dewar,
which contains many useful hints on the management of the most
complex description of cases.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING WITH NITRATE OF POTASS.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>The <i>nitrate of potass</i> [nitre, saltpetre, sal-prunelle], is a dangerous
poison. It has been often mistaken for the saline laxatives,
especially the sulphate of soda, and has thus been the source of fatal
accidents.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> I.—<i>Of the Chemical Tests for Nitrate of Potass.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>It exists in commerce and the arts in two forms, fused and crystallized.
The fused nitre [sal-prunelle] is sold in little button-shaped
masses, spheres of the size of musket-balls, or larger circular cakes,
of a snow-white tint. The crystallized salt [sal-petre] is sold in
whitish, sulcated crystals, which are often regular and large. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>are six-sided prisms, more or lest flattened, and terminated by two
converging planes. In both forms nitre has a peculiar, cool, but
sharp taste.</p>

<p class='c006'>Its chemical properties are characteristic. In the solid form, it animates
the combustion of burning fuel, and yields nitrous fumes when
heated with strong sulphuric acid. In solution it is precipitated
yellow by the chloride of platinum, and yields, when not greatly
diluted, a crystalline precipitate with perchloric acid. The crude salt
of commerce contains chloride of sodium; and hence the odour disengaged
by sulphuric acid may be mixed with that of chlorine or
hydrochloric acid gas. When mixed with any vegetable or animal
infusion by which it is coloured, crystals may sometimes be easily
procured in a state of sufficient purity by filtration and evaporation.
But if not, then the same process must be resorted to with that formerly
recommended for nitric acid (p. <a href='#Page_143'>143</a>), the first step of neutralization
with potass being of course dispensed with.—A process
nearly the same with this has been suggested by M. Kramer of Milan.
He proposes to free the liquid in part of animal matter by adding
acetate of lead, transmitting sulphuretted-hydrogen through the filtered
fluid to remove any excess of lead, boiling the fluid after another
filtration, and then proceeding with acetate of silver to remove chlorides,
as in the process I have adopted. In this way he found nitre
even in the blood.<a id='r447' /><a href='#f447' class='c013'><sup>[447]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> II.—<i>Of the Action of Nitrate of Potass and its Symptoms in Man.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>This substance forms an exception to the general law formerly laid
down with regard to the effect of chemical neutralization on the local
irritants. Both its acid and its alkali are simple irritants; yet the
compound salt, though certainly much inferior in power, is still energetic.
Nay, the experiment of Orfila and the particulars of some recently
published cases tend even to prove, that the action of its alkali
and acid is materially altered in kind by their combination with one
another; for, besides inflaming the part to which it is applied, nitre
has at times produced symptoms of a secondary disorder of the brain
and nerves.</p>

<p class='c006'>The experiments of Orfila upon dogs show that on these animals
it has a twofold action, the one irritating, the other narcotic. He
found that an ounce and a half killed a dog in ninety minutes when
the gullet was tied, and a drachm another in twenty-nine hours:
that death was preceded by giddiness, slight convulsions, dilated
pupil, insensibility and palsy; that after death the stomach was externally
livid, internally reddish-black, and the heart filled in its left
cavities with florid blood; that when the gullet was not tied the
animals recovered after several attacks of vomiting, and general indisposition
for twenty-four hours; and that when the salt was applied
externally to a wound it excited violent inflammation, passing on to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>gangrene, but without any symptom which indicated a remote or
indirect operation.<a id='r448' /><a href='#f448' class='c013'><sup>[448]</sup></a> Mr. Blake found that this salt, when injected
into the veins of a dog in the dose of fifteen grains dissolved in
twenty-four parts of water, causes sudden depression and arrestment
of the action of the heart, and death in less than a minute; but that,
like other salts of potash, it has no influence on the capillaries of the
lungs, though a powerful effect in obstructing the systemic capillary
system.<a id='r449' /><a href='#f449' class='c013'><sup>[449]</sup></a>—When taken in the ordinary way, it is absorbed in the
course of its action, and has been detected both in the blood and the
urine by Kramer of Milan.<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c013'><sup>[450]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>As to its effects on man, it must first be observed, that considerable
doses are necessary to cause serious mischief. In the quantity of
one, two, or three scruples, it is given medicinally several times a
day without injury; and Dr. Alexander found by experiments on
himself, that an ounce and a half, if largely diluted, might thus be
safely administered in the course of twenty-four hours.<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c013'><sup>[451]</sup></a> Sometimes,
too, even large single doses have been swallowed with impunity.
A gentleman of my acquaintance once took nearly an ounce by mistake
for Glauber’s salt, and retained it above a quarter of an hour:
nevertheless, except several attacks of vomiting, no unpleasant symptom
was induced. M. Tourtelle has even related an instance where
two ounces were retained altogether and caused only moderate griping,
with considerable purging and flow of urine.<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c013'><sup>[452]</sup></a> Resting on such
facts as these Tourtelle, with some physicians in more recent times,<a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c013'><sup>[453]</sup></a>
has maintained that nitre is not a worse poison than other saline laxatives;
and some practitioners of the present day have consequently
ventured to administer it for the cure of diseases, in the quantity of
half an ounce in one dose.<a id='r454' /><a href='#f454' class='c013'><sup>[454]</sup></a> It is not easy to say, why these large
doses are at times borne by the stomach without injury,—whether
the cause is idiosyncrasy, or a constitutional insensibility engendered
by disease, or some difference in the mode of administering the salt.
But at all events, the facts which follow will leave no doubt that in
general it is a dangerous and rapid poison in the dose of an ounce.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Alexander found that, in the quantity of a drachm or a drachm
and a half, recently dissolved in four ounces of water, and repeated
every ninety minutes, the third or fourth dose caused chilliness and
stinging pains in the stomach and over the whole body; and these
sensations became so severe with the fourth dose, that he considered
it unsafe to attempt a fifth.<a id='r455' /><a href='#f455' class='c013'><sup>[455]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Two cases which were actually fatal have been described in the
Journal de Médecine for 1787, the one caused by one ounce, the
other by an ounce and a half. In the latter the symptoms were those
of the most violent cholera, and the patient died in two days and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>half;<a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c013'><sup>[456]</sup></a> in the former death took place in three hours only, and in
addition to the symptoms remarked in the other there were convulsions
and twisting of the mouth.<a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c013'><sup>[457]</sup></a> In both the pulse failed at the
wrist, and a great tendency to fainting prevailed for some time before
death. Dr. Geoghegan has communicated to Mr. Taylor a case
where an ounce and a half taken by mistake caused severe pain in
the stomach, vomiting, and death in two hours.<a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c013'><sup>[458]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Similar effects have been remarked in several cases which have
been followed by recovery. A woman in the second month of pregnancy,
immediately after taking a handful of nitre in solution, was
attacked with pain in the stomach, swelling of the whole body and
general pains; she then miscarried, and afterwards had the usual
symptoms of gastritis and dysentery, united with great giddiness,
ringing in the ears, general tremors and excessive chilliness. She
seems to have made a narrow escape, as for three days the discharges
by stool were profuse, and composed chiefly of blood and membranous
flakes.<a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c013'><sup>[459]</sup></a> Dr. Falconer has related another instance, where also the
patient’s life seems to have been in great danger. The quantity
taken was two ounces, and it was swallowed in half a pint of warm
water by mistake instead of a laxative salt. Violent pain in the
belly was immediately produced, in half an hour frequent vomiting,
and in three hours a discharge of about a quart of blood from the
stomach. After the administration of gruel and butter the symptoms
began to subside; but they receded slowly; and even six months
afterwards the man, though otherwise in good health, had frequent
pain in the stomach and flatulence.<a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c013'><sup>[460]</sup></a> In the case of a female in the
second month of pregnancy, described by Dr. Butter, miscarriage
did not take place, although the symptoms were very violent and
lasting. The quantity taken was two ounces. The symptoms were
first bloody vomiting, afterwards dysentery, which continued seven
days; and on the tenth day a nervous affection supervened exactly
like chorea, and of two months’ duration.<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c013'><sup>[461]</sup></a> The effects of the poison
in the latter period of this woman’s illness tend to establish the existence
of a secondary operation on the nervous system. But this
kind of action is more strongly pointed out by the following cases.
Three puerperal women in the Obstetric Hospital of Pavia got each
an ounce of nitre by mistake for sulphate of magnesia. Two, who
vomited immediately, did not suffer. The third, who retained the
salt fifteen minutes, had pain in the stomach and vomiting, followed
by paleness of the countenance, stiffness of the jaw, some stupor, and
convulsive movements of the limbs; which symptoms continued till
next day, when she gradually recovered.<a id='r462' /><a href='#f462' class='c013'><sup>[462]</sup></a> A German physician,
Dr. Geiseler, met with an instance, in which the only disorder produced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>appeared to depend on derangement of the cerebral functions.
A woman, after swallowing an ounce of nitre instead of Glauber’s
salt, lost the use of speech and the power of voluntary motion, then
became insensible, and was attacked with tetanic spasms. This state
lasted till next day, when some amelioration was brought about by
copious sweating. It was not, however, till eight days after, that
she recovered her speech, or the entire use of her mental faculties;
and the palsy of the limbs continued two months.<a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c013'><sup>[463]</sup></a> Her case resembles
the account given by Orfila of the effects of nitre on animals.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> III.—<i>Of the Morbid Appearances caused by Nitrate of Potass.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The morbid appearances observed in man are solely those of violent
inflammation of the stomach and intestines. In Laflize’s case,
which proved fatal in three hours, the stomach was distended, and
the contents deeply tinged with blood; its peritonæal coat of a dark-red colour mottled with black spots; its villous coat very much inflamed
and detached in several places. The liquid contents gave
satisfactory evidence of nitre having been swallowed; for a portion
evaporated to dryness deflagrated with burning charcoal. In Souville’s
patient, who lived sixty hours, the stomach was every where
red, in many places checkered with black spots, and at the centre
of one of these spots the stomach was perforated by a small aperture.
The whole intestinal canal was also red. In Dr. Geoghegan’s case,
the stomach contained bloody mucus, and its villous coat was
brownish-red, and here and there detached. He could not detect
any nitre in it.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING WITH THE ALKALINE AND EARTHY CHLORIDES.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>There can be little doubt that the <i>chlorides</i> of <i>soda</i>, <i>potass</i>, and
<i>lime</i> are active poisons; but the first two have alone been hitherto
carefully investigated by physiological experiments.</p>

<p class='c006'>The two alkaline chlorides are usually seen in the form of colourless
solutions. That of potass is little known in this country; but
that of soda is familiar to all in the shape of Fincham’s chloride of
soda or bleaching liquid. The chloride of lime, which is best known
of them all, is usually in the form of a dry powder, deliquescent, and
acrid, commonly termed bleaching powder. All these substances
are easily known by their peculiar odour of chlorine, and the copious
disengagement of that gas on the addition of sulphuric acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>The action of chloride of soda on the animal body has been examined
by Segalas, who infers that it is an irritant poison, which,
however, at times occasions symptoms of an affection of the nervous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>system. He remarked that three ounces of the solution, commonly
sold in Paris under the name of Labarraque’s disinfecting liquid,
caused immediate death by coagulating the blood in the heart, when
injected into a vein in a dog. Two ounces introduced into the peritonæum
excited palpitation, oppressed breathing, constant restlessness,
and death in ten minutes; and three drachms did not prove
fatal for some hours, tetanic spasms being produced in the first instance,
and peritonæal inflammation being found after death. One
ounce introduced into the stomach of a dog excited immediate vomiting,
and no farther inconvenience; and two ounces retained by a
ligature on the gullet brought on violent efforts to vomit, from which
the animal was gradually recovering, when it was killed in twenty-four
hours for the sake of observing the appearances. The stomach
was found generally inflamed and interspersed with dark, gangrenous-like
spots.<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c013'><sup>[464]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>I am not acquainted with any case of poisoning with these substances
in the human subject. But it is probable that symptoms of
pure irritation and inflammation will occur, and that moderate doses
may prove fatal.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING WITH LIME.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>Lime, the last poison of the present group, is a substance of little
interest to the toxicologist, as its activity is not great.</p>

<p class='c006'>Its physical and chemical properties need not be minutely described.
It is soluble, though sparingly, in water; and the solution
turns the vegetable blues green, restores the purple of reddened
litmus, gives a white precipitate with a stream of carbonic acid gas,
and with oxalic acid a very insoluble precipitate, which is not redissolved
by an excess of the test.</p>

<p class='c006'>Its action is purely irritant. Orfila has found that a drachm and
a half of unslaked lime, given to a little dog, caused vomiting and
slight suffering for a day only, but that three drachms killed the same
animal in five days, vomiting, languor, and whining being the only
symptoms, and redness of the throat, gullet, and stomach, the only
morbid appearances.<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c013'><sup>[465]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Though a feeble poison, it has nevertheless proved fatal in the
human subject. Gmelin takes notice of the case of a boy who swallowed
some lime in an apple-pie, and died in nine days, affected
with thirst, burning in the mouth, burning pain in the belly, and obstinate
constipation.<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c013'><sup>[466]</sup></a> A short account of a case of this kind of poisoning
is also given by Balthazar Timæus. A young woman, afflicted
with pica or depraved appetite, took to the eating of quicklime; and
in consequence she was attacked with pain and gnawing in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>belly, sore throat, dryness of the mouth, insatiable thirst, difficult
breathing and cough; but she recovered.<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c013'><sup>[467]</sup></a> It is well known that
quicklime also inflames the skin or even destroys its texture, apparently
by withdrawing the water which forms a component part of
all soft animal tissues. When thrown into the eyes it causes acute
and obstinate ophthalmia, which may end in loss of sight. On this
account it will belong, I presume, to the poisons included in the
Scottish act against disfiguring or maiming with corrosives.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING WITH AMMONIA AND ITS SALTS.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>The second group of the order of alkaline poisons, including
ammonia with its salts, and the sulphuret of potass, have a double
action on the system, analogous to that possessed by many metallic
poisons. They are powerful irritants; but they produce besides,
through the medium of the blood, a disorder of some part of the nervous
system; and their remote is sometimes more dangerous than
their local action. The nervous affection produced by ammonia and
the sulphuret of potass closely resembles tetanus, and therefore depends
probably on irritation of the spinal column.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of the Chemical tests for the Ammoniacal Salts.</i>—Ammonia is
when pure a gaseous body; but as commonly seen, it exists in solution
in water, which dissolves it in large quantity. The solution has
the usual effects of alkalis on vegetable colours, with the difference,
however,—that the changes of colour are not permanent under the
action of heat. It forms a yellow precipitate, as potass does, with
chloride of platinum. It may at once be distinguished from other
fluids by its peculiar pungent odour, which is possessed by no other
substance except its carbonate.</p>

<p class='c006'>Various <i>carbonates</i> are known in chemistry, but the only one known
in commerce or met with in the shops is the sesqui-carbonate (subcarbonate—smelling
salt—volatile salt—hartshorn). It is solid,
white, fibrous, and has the same odour as pure ammonia. Its solution
differs little in physical properties from the pure liquid ammonia;
but, unlike it, is precipitated by the salts of lime.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>hydrochlorate</i> (muriate of ammonia—sal-ammoniac)—is
known by its solid, white, crystalline appearance; its ductility; its
volatility; and by the effect of caustic potass and nitrate of silver,
the former of which disengages an ammoniacal odour, while the
latter causes in a solution of the salt a white precipitate, the chloride
of silver.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of the action of the Ammoniacal Salts, and their effects on man.</i>—To
determine the action of ammonia on the animal system, Professor
Orfila injected sixty grains of the pure solution into the jugular vein
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>of a dog. Immediately the whole legs were spasmodically extended;
at times convulsions occurred; and in ten minutes it died. The
chest being laid open instantly, coagulated florid blood was seen in
the left ventricle, and black fluid blood in the right ventricle of the
heart. No unusual appearance was discernible any where else except
complete exhaustion of muscular irritability.<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c013'><sup>[468]</sup></a> The experiments of
Mr. Blake also show that ammonia introduced in large doses into
the veins acts by suddenly extinguishing the irritability of the heart.
Small doses first lower arterial pressure from debility of the heart’s
action, and then increase it by obstructing the systemic capillaries.
When injected into the aorta from the axillary artery, it causes great
increase of arterial pressure, owing to the latter cause; and then arrests
the heart, while the respiration goes on. Four seconds are
sufficient for the ammonia to pass from the jugular vein into the heart,
so as to be discovered there by muriatic acid causing white fumes.<a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c013'><sup>[469]</sup></a>
Half a drachm of a strong solution, introduced by Orfila into the
stomach of a dog and secured by a ligature on the gullet, caused at
first much agitation. But in five minutes the animal became still and
soporose; after five hours it continued able to walk; in twenty hours
it was found quite comatose; and death ensued in four hours more.
The only morbid appearance was slight mottled redness of the villous
coat of the stomach. A third dog, to which two drachms and a half
of the common carbonate were given in fine powder, died in twelve
minutes. First it vomited; next it became slightly convulsed; and
the convulsions gradually increased in strength and frequency till the
whole body was agitated by dreadful spasms; then the limbs became
rigid, the body and head were bent backwards, and in this state it
expired, apparently suffocated in a fit of tetanus.<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c013'><sup>[470]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Several cases of poisoning with ammonia or its carbonate have
occurred in the human subject. Plenck has noticed shortly a case
which proved fatal in four minutes, and which was caused by a little
bottleful of ammonia having been poured into the mouth of a man
who had been bitten by a mad-dog.<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c013'><sup>[471]</sup></a> The symptoms are not mentioned,
but it is probable, from the rapidity of the poisoning, that a
nervous affection must have been induced. More generally, however,
the effects are simply irritant; and the seat of the irritation will
vary with the mode in which the poison is given. If it is swallowed,
the stomach and intestines will suffer; if it is imprudently inhaled in
too great quantity, inflammation of the lining membrane of the nostrils
and air-passages will ensue. Huxham has related a very interesting
example of the former affection, as it occurred in a young
man, who had acquired a strange habit of chewing the solid carbonate
of the shops. He was seized with great hemorrhage from the
nose, gums, and intestines; his teeth dropt out; wasting and hectic
fever ensued; and, although he was at length prevailed on to abandon
his pernicious habit, he died of extreme exhaustion, after lingering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>several months.<a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c013'><sup>[472]</sup></a> But the most frequent cases of poisoning
with ammonia have arisen from its being inhaled, and thus exciting
bronchial inflammation. An instructive instance of the kind has
been related by M. Nysten. A medical man, liable to epilepsy, was
found in a fit by his servant, who ignorantly tried to rouse him by
holding assiduously to his nostrils a handkerchief dipped in ammonia.
In this way about two drachms appear to have been consumed. On
recovering his senses, the gentleman complained of burning pain
from the mouth downwards to the stomach, great difficulty in swallowing,
difficult breathing, hard cough, and copious expectoration,
profuse mucous discharge from the nostrils, and excoriation of the
tongue. The bronchitis increased steadily, and carried him off in
the course of the third day, without convulsions or any mental disorder
having supervened.<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c013'><sup>[473]</sup></a> A case precisely similar is related in the
Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal. A lad, while convalescent
from an attack of fever, was seized with epilepsy, for which his
attendant applied ammonia under his nose “with such unwearied,
but destructive benevolence, that suffocation had almost resulted.
As it was, dyspnœa with severe pain of the throat and breast, immediately
succeeded; and death took place forty-eight hours afterwards.”<a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c013'><sup>[474]</sup></a>
A third instance has been recorded of analogous effects
produced by the incautious use of ammonia as an antidote for prussic
acid. The patient had all the symptoms of a violent bronchitis, accompanied
with redness and scattered ulceration of the mouth and
throat; but he recovered in thirteen days.<a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c013'><sup>[475]</sup></a> A fourth case, similar to
the preceding, has been related by M. Souchard of Batignolles. A
druggist, who inhaled while asleep the fumes of ammonia from a
broken carboy, awoke in three-quarters of an hour, with the mucous
membrane of the mouth and nostrils corroded, and a bloody discharge
from the nose. A severe attack of bronchitis followed, during which
he could not speak for six days; but being actively treated with antiphlogistic
remedies, he recovered.<a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c013'><sup>[476]</sup></a>—An extraordinary case has
been published by Mr. Paget of death from injecting ammonia into
the blood-vessels. A solution weak enough to allow of the nose
being held over it was injected into a nævis in a child two years old.
An attack of convulsions immediately followed, and in a minute the
child expired.<a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c013'><sup>[477]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Nysten’s case is the only one in the human subject in which the
<i>morbid appearances</i> were ascertained. The nostrils were blocked up
with an albuminous membrane. The whole mucous coat of the
larynx, trachea, bronchi, and even of some of the bronchial ramifications,
was mottled with patches of lymph. The gullet and stomach
showed red streaks here and there; and there was a black eschar on
the tongue, and another on the lower lip.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of Poisoning with Hydrochlorate of Ammonia.</i>—The effects of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>the hydrochlorate of ammonia on animals have been examined by
Professor Orfila and Dr. Arnold; but I have not yet met with any
instance of its operation as a poison on man. When given to dogs
it irritates and inflames the parts it touches, and causes the ordinary
symptoms of local irritation. But it also acts remotely. For, first,
like arsenic, and other poisons of the third order of irritants, it produces
inflammation of the stomach, in whatever way it is applied to
the body,—Orfila having found that organ affected when the salt was
applied to the subcutaneous cellular tissue;<a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c013'><sup>[478]</sup></a> and, secondly, according
to the experiments of Arnold, it causes, when swallowed, excessive
muscular weakness, slow breathing, violent action of the heart,
and tetanic spasms,—effects which cannot arise from mere injury of
the stomach. Half a drachm will thus kill a rabbit in eight or ten
minutes;<a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c013'><sup>[479]</sup></a> and two drachms a small dog in an hour.<a id='r480' /><a href='#f480' class='c013'><sup>[480]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING WITH THE ALKALINE SULPHURETS.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>The liver of sulphur, or sulphuret of potass of the pharmacopœias,
the last poison of this order to be mentioned, is allied to the ammoniacal
salts in action. It is of no great consequence in a toxicological
point of view in this country, being put to little use; but several
accidents have been caused by it in France, where it is employed for
manufacturing artificial sulphureous waters; and farther, its properties
should be accurately ascertained, because till lately it was erroneously
resorted to as an antidote for some metallic poisons.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Chemical Tests.</i>—It has a grayish, greenish, or yellowish colour
when solid; its dust smells of sulphuretted hydrogen, which is also
copiously disengaged from it by the mineral acids: and it forms with
water a yellow solution of the same odour.—In composite fluids it
may be detected by heating it with acetic acid, and passing the disengaged
gases through solution of acetate of lead, in which a black
precipitate of sulphuret of lead is produced, from the action of sulphuretted-hydrogen.<a id='r481' /><a href='#f481' class='c013'><sup>[481]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Action and Symptoms.</i>—Orfila found that a solution of six drachms
and a half, secured in the stomach of a dog by a ligature on the gullet,
caused death by tetanus in seven minutes, without leaving any
morbid appearance in the body; that inferior doses caused death in
the same manner, but at a later period, and with symptoms of irritation
in the alimentary canal, which also was seen red, black, or even
ulcerated after death; that a solution of twenty-two grains injected
into the jugular vein killed a dog in two minutes, convulsions having
preceded death, and the heart being found paralysed immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>after it; and that a drachm and a half thrust in small fragments under
the skin occasioned death in thirteen hours with coma and extensive
inflammation of the cellular tissue.<a id='r482' /><a href='#f482' class='c013'><sup>[482]</sup></a> There can be no doubt, therefore,
that liver of sulphur is a true narcotic acrid poison.—It is absorbed,
and may be detected in the blood, liver, kidneys, and urine
by Orfila’s process.<a id='r483' /><a href='#f483' class='c013'><sup>[483]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila has collected three cases of poisoning in the human subject
with this substance;<a id='r484' /><a href='#f484' class='c013'><sup>[484]</sup></a> and a fourth has been related by M. Cayol.<a id='r485' /><a href='#f485' class='c013'><sup>[485]</sup></a>
Of these cases two proved fatal in less than fifteen minutes; and the
symptoms were acrid taste, slight vomiting, mortal faintness, and convulsions,
with an important chemical sign, the tainting of the air with
the odour of sulphuretted-hydrogen. The dose in one case was about
three drachms. The two other patients, who recovered, were for some
days dangerously ill. The symptoms were burning pain and constriction
in the throat, gullet, and stomach; frequent vomiting, at first
sulphureous, afterwards sanguinolent; purging, at first sulphureous;
sulphureous exhalations from the mouth; pulse at first quick and
strong, afterwards feeble, fluttering, and almost imperceptible; in one
case sopor; finally severe inflammation of the gullet, stomach and
intestines, which abated in three days. One of these patients took
four drachms of sulphuret of soda, the other two ounces of sulphuret
of potass; but it is probable, that the latter dose was partly decomposed
by long keeping.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Morbid Appearances.</i>—The morbid appearances in the two fatal
cases were great lividity of the face and extremities, and exhaustion
of muscular contractility immediately after death; the stomach
was red internally, and lined with sulphur; the duodenum also red;
the lungs soft, gorged with black fluid blood, and not crepitant.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Treatment.</i>—The most appropriate treatment consists in the instant
administration of any diluent, then of frequent doses of the chloride
of soda, and lastly the antiphlogistic mode of subduing inflammation.
The chloride of soda or lime decomposes sulphuretted
hydrogen, the disengagement of which is the probable cause of death
in the quickly fatal cases.<a id='r486' /><a href='#f486' class='c013'><sup>[486]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING WITH ARSENIC.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>The third order of the irritant class of poisons includes the compounds
of the metals. These are of great importance to the medical
jurist. They are frequently used for criminal purposes; they give
rise to the greatest variety of symptoms; and the medical evidence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>on trials respecting them, while much skill is required on the part of
the witness to collect it, is also the most conclusive.</p>

<p class='c006'>It must not be inferred from their being arranged in the class of
irritants that their action is merely local. In fact this is the case with
a very few of them only, which produce chemical corrosion. The
greater number likewise act indirectly on organs at a distance from
the part to which they are applied. Nevertheless the most prominent
symptoms generally produced by them are those of violent local
irritation; so that they may be justly considered in the place which
has been assigned them.</p>

<p class='c006'>The poisons included in this order are the oxides and salts of
arsenic, mercury, copper, antimony, tin, silver, gold, bismuth, iron,
chrome, zinc, barium, lead. Many other metals also form poisonous
compounds with various acids and other bodies; but these are so rare
as to be merely objects of physiological curiosity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of all the varieties of death by poison, none is so important to the
medical jurist as poisoning with arsenic. On account of the shameful
facility with which it may be procured in this country, even by
the lowest of the vulgar, and the ease with which it may be secretly
administered, it is the poison most frequently chosen for the purpose
of committing both suicide and murder. In 1837 and 1838 no fewer
than 186 cases of fatal poisoning with arsenic were known to have
occurred in England alone (see p. <a href='#Page_90'>90</a>). Of 221 cases of murder by
poison in France during ten years subsequent to 1829, in which the
poison given was ascertained, there were 149 where the substance
administered was arsenic.<a id='r487' /><a href='#f487' class='c013'><sup>[487]</sup></a> It is fortunate, therefore, that there are
few substances in nature, and perhaps hardly any other poison, whose
presence can be detected in such minute quantities and with so great
certainty.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> I.—<i>Of the Chemical Tests for the Compounds of Arsenic.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Metallic arsenic has an iron-gray colour, a specific gravity of 8·308,
and a crystalline fracture. It is very brittle. It has a strong tendency
to oxidate, so that it undergoes this change in air, in water,
and even in alcohol. In air, particularly when moist, it becomes
rapidly tarnished, a black powder being formed, which some have
regarded as a regular protoxide.<a id='r488' /><a href='#f488' class='c013'><sup>[488]</sup></a>—When exposed to heat, metallic
arsenic is usually said to sublime at the temperature of 356° F.; but
according to some late experiments by Dr. Mitchell of Philadelphia
this does not happen under a low red heat, luminous in the dark.<a id='r489' /><a href='#f489' class='c013'><sup>[489]</sup></a>
In close vessels it condenses unchanged; but when heated in the
open air, it passes to the state of white oxide, and rises in white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>fumes. This substance is a sesquioxide, consisting of two equivalents
of metal and three of oxygen. Another oxide likewise exists,
which contains two equivalents of metal and five of oxygen, and,
possessing strong acid properties, is denominated arsenic acid. The
sesquioxide and arsenic acid unite with bases, and produce compounds
which, with the exception of those they form with the alkalis, are
mostly insoluble. Metallic arsenic unites with sulphur in two proportions,
forming an orange-red and a sulphur-yellow compound.
The compounds of arsenic have very little chemical action with vegetable
and animal principles.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of the compounds which arsenic thus forms, those which it will
be necessary to particularize are the following:—1. The protoxide
of Berzelius, or <i>fly-powder</i>. 2. The arsenious acid, or <i>white arsenic</i>.
3. The arsenite of copper, or <i>mineral green</i>. 4. The arsenite of potass
as contained in <i>Fowler’s solution</i>. 5. The arsenite of potass; 6.
The various sulphurets, pure and impure, namely, <i>realgar</i>, <i>orpiment</i>,
and <i>king’s yellow</i>; and 7. Arseniuretted-hydrogen gas.</p>

<h5 class='c011'><i>Of the Tests for Fly-powder.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>This substance is rarely known as a poison in Britain, but is a
familiar poison in France and Germany, under the names of <i>Poudre
à mouches</i>, and <i>Fliegenstein</i>. Of late it has been occasionally used
in Scotland for poisoning rats.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is a fine grayish-black powder, formed by exposing powdered
arsenic for a long time to the air; but it also frequently contains fragments
of the metal. It is usually considered by chemists to be a
mixture of metallic arsenic and its white oxide.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is acted on by water, the white oxide being found ere long in
solution by its proper tests. Oxidation and solution, however, are
also effected upon pure metallic arsenic in the same manner. A
thousand grains of water take up a grain in the course of half an hour
when boiled on the metal.<a id='r490' /><a href='#f490' class='c013'><sup>[490]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>A very simple and decisive test for fly-powder is derived from the
effect of heat. If it is heated in a tube two substances are sublimed,
first a white crystalline powder, and then a bright metallic crust, the
former being the white oxide, the latter the metal. The metallic
crust thus formed possesses physical properties, which distinguish
arsenic from all other substances, capable of being sublimed by a low
heat: The surface next the tube is very like polished steel, being a
little darker in colour, but equal in brilliancy and polish; and the inner
surface is either brilliantly crystalline to the naked eye, like the
fracture of cast-iron, or has a dull grayish-white colour, but appears
crystalline before a common magnifying lens of four or five powers.
If these characters be attended to, particularly the appearance of the
inner surface, it appears to me scarcely possible to mistake for an arsenical
crust any other substance which can be sublimed by any of
the methods for subliming arsenic.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>If a farther test should be desired, it is only necessary, as was first
proposed by Dr. Turner of London,<a id='r491' /><a href='#f491' class='c013'><sup>[491]</sup></a> to chase the crust up and down
the tube with the spirit-lamp flame till it is all oxidated, when little
octaedral crystals of adamantine lustre are formed, on which, either
with the naked eye or with the aid of a common lens, triangular facettes
may be distinguished.</p>

<p class='c006'>The niceties to be attended to in applying the preceding tests will
be considered presently under the head of the next compound, the
sesquioxide.</p>

<h5 class='c011'>2. <i>Of the Tests for Arsenious Acid.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>Arsenious acid, the sesquioxide, or white oxide of arsenic, usually
called white arsenic, or simply arsenic, is the most common and important
of all the arsenical preparations.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is met with in the shops in two forms,—as a snow-white gritty
powder, and in solid masses generally opaque, but sometimes translucent.
When newly sublimed it is in translucent or even almost
transparent masses of a vitreous lustre, conchoidal fracture and sharp-edged.
By keeping it becomes opaque and white. The nature of
the change has not been determined; but some alteration is certainly
effected, for Guibourt, who has examined both varieties with care,
found that the opaque variety is more soluble in water than the other.
He adds that the former is alkaline, the latter acid, in its action on
litmus paper; but I have always found the opaque variety acid.<a id='r492' /><a href='#f492' class='c013'><sup>[492]</sup></a>
The powder soon becomes analogous to the opaque variety of the
oxide in mass.</p>

<p class='c006'>The oxide of arsenic has a specific gravity of 3·729, according to
the experiments of Dr. Ure,—of 3·529 when opaque, according to
Mr. Alfred Taylor, and 3·798, when translucent. Very incorrect notions
prevail as to its taste. It was long universally believed to be
acrid,<a id='r493' /><a href='#f493' class='c013'><sup>[493]</sup></a> and is described to be so in many systematic works and express
treatises; but in reality it has little or no taste at all. The
reader will find some details on this point in a paper I published in
the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal.<a id='r494' /><a href='#f494' class='c013'><sup>[494]</sup></a> In the present work
it is sufficient to observe, that I have repeatedly made the trial, and
seen it made at my request by several scientific friends, and that,
after continuing the experiment as long, and extending the poison
along the tongue as far back, as we thought safe, all agreed that it
had scarcely any taste at all,—perhaps towards the close a very faint
sweetish taste. It appears to me that the experiments made on that
occasion might have set at rest the question as to the taste of arsenic,
and corrected an important error long committed by systematic authors
in chemistry as well as medical jurisprudence. And accordingly
in this country the truth is generally known.<a id='r495' /><a href='#f495' class='c013'><sup>[495]</sup></a> Professor Orfila, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>continues to repeat the error; for even in the last edition of his
Toxicologie he says it has “a rough, not corrosive, slightly styptic
taste, perceptible not for a few seconds, but persistent, and attended with
salivation.”<a id='r496' /><a href='#f496' class='c013'><sup>[496]</sup></a> These sensations must be either imaginary or the indications
of an organ peculiarly constituted. It is impossible to make
satisfactory experiments with safety on its impressions on the back
of the palate. But we may rest assured that in general it makes no
impression there at all; for it has been often swallowed unknowingly
with articles of food. Not a few have in such circumstances noticed
merely its grittiness, and thought there was sand in their food. Two
instances only am I hitherto acquainted with, where an acrid sensation
would seem really to have been experienced in the act of eating
or swallowing. In one of these, noticed in Rust’s Journal, the individual
who was poisoned, could not finish the poisoned dish on
account of its unpleasant, very peppery taste.<a id='r497' /><a href='#f497' class='c013'><sup>[497]</sup></a> In the other case,
which was lately communicated to me by Mr. Hewson of Lincoln,
the individual, who was poisoned by arsenic dissolved in his tea-kettle,—happening
in the first instance to wash his mouth with the water,—observed
at the time to his daughter, that it had a very odd
taste; which subsequently was called a burning taste. These
facts, however, are evidently not altogether satisfactory. It is not
improbable that, in an <i>ex post facto</i> description, the reporters, as
others in the same circumstances have clearly done<a id='r498' /><a href='#f498' class='c013'><sup>[498]</sup></a>, confounded the
subsequent inflammation with mere taste in the act of chewing or
swallowing. At all events it is absolutely certain that the great majority
of people who have been poisoned with arsenic remarked in
taking it either no taste at all, or merely a roughness owing to the
gritty condition of its powder.</p>

<p class='c006'>The oxide of arsenic when subjected to heat is sublimed at 380°,
or, according to Dr. Mitchell, 425° F.<a id='r499' /><a href='#f499' class='c013'><sup>[499]</sup></a> and condenses in the form
of a crystalline powder, which, if the operation is performed slowly
and on a small quantity proportioned to the size of the tube, evidently
consists of little, adamantine octaedres.—When it is mixed
with carbonaceous matter and heated, it is reduced, and the metal is
sublimed. This constitutes the test of reduction, which, when conducted
with due care, may be rendered singly a certain proof of the
presence of arsenic.</p>

<p class='c006'>Water dissolves it. Its solubility is a point of some medico-legal
importance; for a doubt may arise whether the quantity of a solution
that has been swallowed contained a sufficient dose to cause severe
symptoms or death. Different statements have gone forth on this
head. Klaproth found, that a thousand parts of temperate water
take up only two parts and a half,—and that a thousand parts of
boiling water take up 77·75 parts or a thirteenth, and retain on cooling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>30 parts or a thirty-third of their weight.<a id='r500' /><a href='#f500' class='c013'><sup>[500]</sup></a> Guibourt found a
difference between the transparent and opaque varieties; for a thousand
parts of temperate water dissolved in thirty-six hours 9·6 of the
transparent, 12·5 of the opaque variety; and the same quantity of
boiling water dissolved of the transparent variety 97 parts, retaining
18 when cooled, but of the opaque variety took up 115 and retained
on cooling 29.<a id='r501' /><a href='#f501' class='c013'><sup>[501]</sup></a> More lately Mr. Alfred Taylor observed that temperate
water, simply poured on the opaque oxide and left for seventy-two
hours, contained one grain in a thousand, but if often agitated,
8·5 grains; that boiling water, occasionally agitated for the same
period, contained 9·27 or 9·54 grains; that water, boiling gently for
an hour dissolved 31·5, and on cooling and resting for three days
retained 17; that with violent ebullition for an hour, it took up 46·3,
and retained 24·7 grains on cooling and resting for three days; that
a saturated boiling solution after six months contained 24 or 26
grains; and that a saturated boiling solution of the transparent oxide
contained 46 or 47·5 grains, and on cooling and resting for two days
retained 18·7 or 13·4 grains.<a id='r502' /><a href='#f502' class='c013'><sup>[502]</sup></a> It is impossible to account for these
discrepancies; for all the experimentalists conducted their investigations
with care, and with a view to the medico-legal question stated
above. Hahnemann farther remarked, that at the temperature of the
blood a thousand parts of water dissolve ten parts with the aid of
ten minutes’ agitation;<a id='r503' /><a href='#f503' class='c013'><sup>[503]</sup></a> and Navier, that boiling water kept for an
hour on it, and decanted off in the way an infusion is usually made,
dissolves 12·5 grains in every thousand.<a id='r504' /><a href='#f504' class='c013'><sup>[504]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Its solubility is impaired by the presence of organic principles.
When mixed with mucus or milk it dissolves, according to Hahnemann,
with great difficulty; and I have found that a cup of tea, left
beside the fire at a temperature of 200° for half an hour upon two
grains of the oxide, does not take up entirely even that small quantity.
An important consequence of the fact now mentioned is, that
when swallowed in the solid state, little or no arsenic may be found
in the fluid contents of the stomach. In a case which occurred to
Scheele three grains of solid arsenic were found in the contents, but
hardly a trace in solution.<a id='r505' /><a href='#f505' class='c013'><sup>[505]</sup></a> It would be wrong, however, to suppose
that it is never found in the fluid contents. For, not to mention the
observations of others, I have myself often detected it in the fluid
part of the stomach in persons poisoned by arsenic.</p>

<p class='c006'>The solution of oxide of arsenic in boiling water yields minute
crystals on cooling, which, when their form is defined, are octaedres.
In this state, on account of its whiteness and brilliancy, it exceedingly
resembles pounded sugar. By spontaneous evaporation I
have procured in twelve months fine octaedres nearly as large as
peas. These do not become opaque by keeping, like the sublimed
masses.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>A difference of opinion prevails as to the action of the oxide on
vegetable colours. This is a matter of no great consequence to the
medical jurist; but it is right not to leave a disputed point without
some notice. Guibourt says the transparent variety faintly reddens
litmus, while the opaque variety faintly restores to blue litmus previously
reddened.<a id='r506' /><a href='#f506' class='c013'><sup>[506]</sup></a> My own experiments are at variance with these
statements: I have always found that the solution of the powder,
which is of the opaque variety, faintly reddens litmus, and does not
alter reddened litmus.</p>

<p class='c006'>The remaining chemical properties of the oxide, which it is necessary
for the medical jurist to know, will be mentioned under what is
now to be said of the principal test by which its presence may be
ascertained. Under this head will be noticed, first the tests for the
solid oxide, secondly, those for its solution, and lastly, the method
of detecting it when mingled with vegetable or animal solids and
fluids, such as the contents and tissues of the stomach.</p>

<h6 class='c011'><i>Of the Tests for Arsenic in the solid state.</i></h6>

<p class='c012'>The most characteristic and simple test for oxide of arsenic in its
solid state, either pure or mixed or combined with inorganic substances,
is its reduction to the metallic state.</p>

<p class='c006'>Various methods have been at different times proposed for employing
the test of reduction. In the ruder periods of analytic chemistry
we find Hahnemann recommending a retort as the fittest instrument,
and stating ten grains as the least quantity he could detect.<a id='r507' /><a href='#f507' class='c013'><sup>[507]</sup></a> Afterwards
Dr. Black substituted a small glass tube, coated with clay and
heated in a choffer; and in this way he could discover a single
grain.<a id='r508' /><a href='#f508' class='c013'><sup>[508]</sup></a> In a paper published in the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical
Journal, I showed how to detect a sixteenth of a grain; and
afterwards even so minute a quantity as a hundreth part of a grain.<a id='r509' /><a href='#f509' class='c013'><sup>[509]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The process is performed in a glass tube; which, when the quantity
of the oxide is very small, should not exceed an eighth of an
inch in diameter, and may be conveniently used of the form first recommended
by Berzelius, and represented in Fig. 3.—The best material
for reducing the oxide is recently ignited charcoal, if the quantity
of suspected substance be very small. For when any of the
ordinary alkaline fluxes is used, more than half of the arsenic is retained,
probably in the form of an arseniuret of the alkaline metalloid.
But when the quantity of matter for analysis is considerable,
charcoal is inconvenient, as it is apt to be projected up the tube on
the application of heat; and an alkaline flux is on that account preferable.
For this purpose soda-flux,—made by grinding crystals
of carbonate of soda with an eighth of their weight of charcoal,
and then heating the mixture gradually to redness, so as to drive off
all water,—is better than the more familiar black flux, which contains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>carbonate of potash; because the latter attracts much moisture
when kept for some time.—If the quantity operated on is large it
should be mixed with the flux before being introduced into the tube;
if it is small, it may be dropped into the tube and covered with
charcoal. The materials are to be introduced along a little triangular
gutter of stiff paper, if the tube is large; but with a small tube
it is preferable to use the little glass funnel represented in Fig. 2, to
which a wire is previously fitted, for pushing the matter down when
it adheres. The material should not be closely impacted. Heat is
best applied with the spirit-lamp, first to the upper part of the material,
with a small flame, and then to the bottom of the tube, the
flame being previously enlarged. A little water, disengaged in the
first instance, should be removed with a roll of filtering paper, before
a sufficient heat is applied to sublime the metal. As soon as
the dark crust begins to form, the tube should be held steady in the
same part of the flame. With these precautions a well defined crust
will be procured with facility.</p>

<p class='c006'>The characters of the crust have been mentioned already under the
head of fly-powder (p. <a href='#Page_199'>199</a>). They are distinct even in crusts
weighing only a 300th of a grain. A crust of this weight, a tenth
of an inch broad and four times as long, may show characteristically
all the physical characters of an arsenical sublimate a hundred times
larger.</p>

<p class='c006'>The fallacies to which the test has been supposed to be liable
(excluding at present that part of it which consists in the oxidation
of the metal, and which renders it quite unimpeachable), are the following.— Dr.
Paris says he has known an instance where a person,
“by no means deficient in chemical address, mistook for it a deposit
of charcoal,”<a id='r510' /><a href='#f510' class='c013'><sup>[510]</sup></a> and I have known the same mistake happen in the
hands of one of my pupils, a beginner in the study of medico-legal
chemistry. The outer surface of a charcoal crust may be mistaken
for arsenic by a careless person; but with ordinary care it is quite
impossible to err if the inner surface be examined, for that of charcoal
is brown, powdery, and perfectly dull.—It has been suggested
to me and has been stated in print,<a id='r511' /><a href='#f511' class='c013'><sup>[511]</sup></a> that the preparations of antimony
yield by reduction a sublimate resembling closely an arsenical crust.
But in consequence of repeated trials I am certain that no preparation
of antimony, reduced either by charcoal or the black flux with
the fullest red heat of the blowpipe will yield any metallic sublimate;
and the same facts were observed by the late Dr. Turner.—It
has even been said by Mr. Donovan that the action of the flux on
glass which contains lead causes a stain similar to an arsenical crust.<a id='r512' /><a href='#f512' class='c013'><sup>[512]</sup></a>
If it be meant by this observation, that the lead contained in the
glass usually gives that part of the tube which contains the flux a
glimmering appearance and impairs its transparency, the author is
correct: but it is impossible that a sublimate can be so formed.—Dr.
Mitchell of Philadelphia in an elaborate paper on the process of reduction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>seems to consider the crust undistinguishable from that formed
in similar circumstances by cinnabar.<a id='r513' /><a href='#f513' class='c013'><sup>[513]</sup></a> Crusts of cinnabar,
however, do not present the peculiar character possessed by the internal
surface of arsenic.—Zinc, it is said, may be sublimed in its
metallic state; but the sublimation of zinc requires a full white
heat; which in the process for arsenic cannot be generated.—Tellurium,
cadmium, and potassium sublime at a lower heat; but these
metals are so exceedingly rare, that it is quite unnecessary to particularize
the characters of their sublimates.—Lastly, it is said that a
crust may be produced from arsenic contained in the glass of the
tube. A few years ago MM. Ozanam and Idt of Lyons detected
arsenic in the remains of a body which had been seven years interred;
but subsequently M. Idt imagined he had discovered that the
glass used in the analysis contained arsenic, and yielded it by the
process of reduction. He accordingly retracted his original opinion;
and the person accused of administering the poison was acquitted.
An extended inquiry, however, was in consequence undertaken by the
Parisian Academy of Medicine at the request of the French government.
And the result was that no arsenic could be detected in the
glass tubes used by MM. Ozanam and Idt; and that although arsenic
is sometimes used in glass-making, and a trace of it may be retained
in some opaque glasses or enamels, it cannot be detected by any process
of analysis in any of the clear glass met with in commerce,<a id='r514' /><a href='#f514' class='c013'><sup>[514]</sup></a>
the whole arsenic being volatilized during the manufacture of the
glass.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may therefore be safely laid down that the appearances exhibited
by a well-formed arsenical crust, even in the minute quantity of a
300th part of a grain, are imitated by no substance in nature which
can be sublimed by the process for the reduction of arsenic.</p>

<p class='c006'>But should farther evidence be required as to the nature of the
crust, this may be obtained by subjecting it to oxidation by heat.</p>

<p class='c006'>The best method of doing so is to heat the ball containing the flux
deprived of arsenic, to attach a bit of glass tube to its end, and to
draw this gently off in the spirit-flame, taking care to prevent the
flux being driven forward on the crust. This being done, the
whole crust, or, if it is large, a portion of it, is to be chased up
and down the tube with a small spirit-lamp flame till it is all converted
into a white powder. In order to show the crystalline form of
the powder distinctly, let the flame be reduced to the volume of a
pea by drawing in the wick, and let the part of the tube containing
the oxide be held half an inch or an inch above it. By repeated trials
sparkling crystals will at length be formed, which are octaedres,—the
crystalline form of arsenious acid. The triangular facettes of the
octaedres may be sometimes seen with the naked eye, though the
original crust was only a fiftieth of a grain or even less; and they
may be always seen with a lens of four powers, the tube being held
between the eye and a lighted candle or a ray of sunshine, either of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>which is preferable to diffuse daylight for making this observation.—For
the success of the oxidation test it is indispensable that the inside
of the tube be not soiled with an alkaline flux: because the alkali
would unite with the oxide. It is also requisite not to heat the tube
suddenly to redness before the oxide is sublimed; because then the
oxide is apt to unite with the glass, forming a white, opaque enamel.
The physical characters of the sublimed oxide are so delicate and
precise, that they may be accurately distinguished, even when those
of the metallic crust are obscure, owing to its minuteness. Sometimes
too, the metal may be so scanty that it is oxidated at once in
the act of subliming, and never presents the appearance of a metallic
crust. Although the characters of the crystalline oxide in either of
these cases are very precise and distinctive, it may be right to subject
it to a farther test when the metal is not previously exhibited with
its characteristic properties. For this purpose it is sufficient to cut
away with a file the portion of the tube which contains the sublimate,
to boil it in another tube with a few drops of distilled water
till the sublimate disappear, and then to test the solution with one of
the fluid tests to be presently described, the ammoniacal nitrate of
silver.</p>

<p class='c006'>After all that has been recently written as to the old and newer
processes for detecting arsenic, I must nevertheless avow my conviction,
that for solid arsenic no test is, for medico-legal purposes, at
once so satisfactory, convenient, and delicate as the test of reduction,
especially with the addition of the supplementary test of oxidation.
That other methods are still more delicate may be readily granted.
But where the suspected substance is in the solid form, what possible
occasion can there be for a method more delicate than one which
will detect a 300th part of a grain? A method ten times less so would
meet every case in actual practice.—A variety of supplementary tests
have been proposed. But they are all greatly inferior in facility, or
conclusiveness, or both, to the process of oxidation, and ought therefore
to be expelled from medico-legal practice,—not even excepting
the alliaceous odour of metallic arsenic in the act of subliming, a
character, the fallaciousness of which was long ago pointed out by
myself as well as others, and to which a preposterous importance has
been attached in some late inquiries. The reader will find in the last
edition of this work an attempt to estimate the value of various tests
supplementary to that of reduction. This disquisition is now omitted,
as it seems no longer necessary.</p>

<h6 class='c011'><i>Of the Tests for Oxide of Arsenic in Solution.</i></h6>

<p class='c012'>Oxide of arsenic in a state of solution may be detected in one of
four ways; by what are called the liquid tests; by precipitating it
with one of these, and subliming metallic arsenic from the precipitate,
which method is usually termed the reduction process; by Marsh’s
method, which consists in disengaging it in the form of arseniuretted-hydrogen
gas, and decomposing the gas by combustion; or by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>method of Reinsch, in which metallic arsenic is deposited on the
surface of copper, and then separated by heat for farther examination.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Process by Liquid Reagents.</i>—The first method is by the employment
of several liquid tests, which cause in the solution peculiar
precipitates. Many such tests have been proposed; but the most
characteristic and precise are <i>hydrosulphuric acid</i>, <i>ammoniacal nitrate
of silver</i>, and <i>ammoniacal sulphate of copper</i>. The indications of each
of the three tests must concur, otherwise, in a medico-legal case, no
one can be entitled to speak with certainty to the existence of arsenic.
But when they do concur, the evidence is unimpeachable. When
this method of analysis is followed, corresponding experiments ought
always to be made with the water that is used for diluting or otherwise
preparing the subject of examination, or with distilled water, if the
article be already sufficiently aqueous. This precaution is necessary
on account of the risk of accidental impregnation of the water or
other reagents with arsenic.<a id='r515' /><a href='#f515' class='c013'><sup>[515]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Hydrosulphuric acid</i> [sulphuretted-hydrogen] is obtained by decomposing
proto-sulphuret of iron with diluted sulphuric acid in such an
apparatus as is represented at Fig. 5. And the gas may be either
applied directly to the suspected fluid, or condensed in distilled water,
and thus kept in store for occasional use in the liquid shape. Before
applying this test, the suspected fluid must be acidulated with acetic
or hydrochloric acid; because an excess of alkali prevents the action.
And if an acid be indicated by litmus in the fluid, neutralization, or
slight supersaturation, with potash must be effected, before adding
acetic or hydrochloric acid; for if the acidity should happen to be
owing to an excess of sulphuric or nitric acid, the test is decomposed,
and yellowish-white sulphur deposited.—These precautions being
taken, hydrosulphuric acid occasions a sulphur-yellow or lemon-yellow
precipitate. If the arsenical solution, however, be very weak,
a yellow colour merely is struck, because the precipitate, which is
sesqui-sulphuret of arsenic, is dissolved by the excess of the test;
but it separates after ebullition, or a few hours’ exposure to the air.
Co-existing animal and vegetable principles sometimes enable the
fluid to retain a minute portion even after ebullition, so as to acquire
a yellow milkiness; but they do not in any case prevent the test from
producing the yellow colour. Acidulation with acetic or hydrochloric
acid favours its subsidence in all cases; and according to Mr. Boutigny,
alkaline sulphates, muriates and nitrates have the same effect.<a id='r516' /><a href='#f516' class='c013'><sup>[516]</sup></a>
Hydrosulphuric acid is so delicate as to act on the oxide in a hundred
thousand parts of water. The proper colour of the precipitate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>is lemon or sulphur-yellow; which, when vegetable or animal matter
is present, acquires a shade of white or brown.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not liable to any material fallacy. The salts of cadmium
yield with it precipitates nearly of the same colour: but they are
exceedingly rare; and the precipitate, unlike sulphuret of arsenic, is
insoluble in ammonia.—The salts formed by selenic acid, if decomposed
by another acid, also yield yellow precipitates; but these salts
are extremely rare.—The salts of peroxide of tin give a dirty grayish-yellow
precipitate; which however ammonia turns brown.—A lead
solution acidulated with hydrochloric acid gives at first a yellow
precipitate; but this becomes brownish-black when more gas is transmitted.<a id='r517' /><a href='#f517' class='c013'><sup>[517]</sup></a>
The contents of the human intestines sometimes yield a
yellowish precipitate though no arsenic be present; and it is dissolved,
like sulphuret of arsenic, by ammonia.<a id='r518' /><a href='#f518' class='c013'><sup>[518]</sup></a> The tartrate of antimony and
potash (tartar-emetic) does not form, as was once thought, any
source of fallacy, the antimonial precipitate having always a tint of
orange-red; besides it is not, like sulphuret of arsenic, soluble in carbonate
of ammonia.—Other fallacies exist, unless the test be used
with the precautions mentioned above. But these need not enumeration
here.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Ammoniacal nitrate of silver</i> is prepared by precipitating the oxide of
silver by means of ammonia, from a solution of nitrate of silver or
lunar caustic in ten parts of water, and then redissolving the precipitate
nearly, but not entirely, by adding gradually an excess of ammonia.
When thus prepared, it causes, even in a very diluted solution
of the oxide of arsenic, a lively lemon-yellow precipitate of
arsenite of silver; which passes to dark brown under exposure to the
light.—The action of this test is prevented by nitric, acetic, citric,
or tartaric acid in excess, particularly by the first and last. It is also
prevented by an excess of ammonia; and in very diluted solutions
by the nitrate of ammonia. These facts will suggest the necessity of
certain obvious precautions. Its action is obscured by the co-existence
of various salts, which singly cause a white precipitate with
nitrate of silver; for the yellow colour is then much lessened in intensity.
The only one of these requiring special notice, because it
occurs in very many of the fluids which are likely to be subjected to
the researches of the medical jurist, is common sea-salt, the chloride
of sodium. The best way of getting rid of the difficulty is to use in
the first instance, not the ammoniacal nitrate, but the simple nitrate
of silver, as long as any white precipitate falls down, to add a slight
excess of that test, and then, after subsidence, to drop in ammonia.
No arsenic is thrown down by the first steps of this process; but if
any be present, it is subsequently thrown down in the form of the
yellow arsenite of silver, on the addition of ammonia. This simple
mode of getting rid of chloride of sodium was first proposed by Dr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Marcet.<a id='r519' /><a href='#f519' class='c013'><sup>[519]</sup></a>—Ammoniacal nitrate of silver is of no use as a test for a
moderately diluted solution of the oxide of arsenic, if vegetable or
animal matter be present; either the colour of the precipitate is essentially
altered, or no precipitate is formed at all.<a id='r520' /><a href='#f520' class='c013'><sup>[520]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>If the presence of arsenic is to be inferred only when the full
lemon-yellow colour of the precipitate is developed, this test is not
liable to any material fallacy. The presence of a phosphate, a serious
obstacle according to an old way of using the silver test, is not
a source of fallacy in the instance of the ammoniacal nitrate; for the
yellow phosphate of silver is so soluble in the ammonia of the test,
that it is not thrown down unless the phosphatic solution is very
strong.—The silver test, which is extremely delicate, was proposed
by Mr. Hume, a chemist of London; and in its improved state was
suggested by the late Dr. Marcet. Various foreign authors have
fallen into the error of supposing that nitrate of silver without an
alkali precipitates oxide of arsenic: without an alkali, pure nitrate
of silver gives no precipitate, or at most a bluish-white or yellowish-white
haze when both solutions are strong.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Ammoniacal sulphate of copper</i> is prepared by the same process
with the last test, sulphate of copper being substituted for nitrate of
silver. It is a test of very great delicacy. It causes in solutions of
the oxide of arsenic an apple-green or grass-green precipitate of the
arsenite of copper. The particular tint is altered apparently by
trifling circumstances; but after the precipitate has stood some hours
it always assumes a tint intermediate between apple-green and grass-green.
The operation of this test is prevented by hydrochloric,
nitric, sulphuric, acetic, citric, and tartaric acids in excess; and also
by an excess of ammonia. These difficulties are obviated by manifest
precautions. It is also prevented, according to Hünefeld, by
muriate, nitrate, and sulphate of ammonia;<a id='r521' /><a href='#f521' class='c013'><sup>[521]</sup></a> and by almost all vegetable
infusions and animal fluids, when the oxide of arsenic is not
abundant: these difficulties cannot be obviated. Even when not
prevented by such fluids, its operation is often obscured, the precipitate
not possessing its characteristic colour.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ammoniacal sulphate of copper is more open to fallacies than the
silver test. Of these the most important is that in some organic
fluids it strikes a green precipitate, like the arsenite of copper, though
arsenic be not present.<a id='r522' /><a href='#f522' class='c013'><sup>[522]</sup></a> The solution of bichromate of potass is
turned green but not precipitated by it.</p>

<p class='c006'>On reviewing all that has now been stated regarding the liquid
tests for arsenic, it will appear that there is no single test on which
absolute reliance can be placed; but that the fallacies to which they
are liable are generally remote, and each of them applicable to one
test only. Hence if each of the three reagents, applied with due
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>care, gives a precipitate of the characteristic tint, the proof of the
presence of arsenic is decisive.</p>

<p class='c006'>This particular view of the indications of the liquid tests, however
obvious it may seem, has been often overlooked by the numerous
chemists and medical jurists who have written for and against them.
The antagonists of the tests have been content with proving how so
many fallacies lie in the way of each, that no dependence can be
put in any one of them: They have not considered that the fallacies
attached to one are obviated by the conjunct indications of the
others.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am of opinion therefore that the analysis for arsenic by liquid
reagents has been unjustly neglected in the present day. It is an
exceedingly convenient method, and one of extreme delicacy, because
by using small tubes it is easy to operate with precision on very
minute portions of a suspected fluid. It is also perfectly conclusive,
so far as chemical knowledge now goes. On a remarkable trial a
few years ago in this country, a distinguished chemist, who, as witness
for the prisoner, was made by counsel to throw discredit on the
liquid tests individually, nevertheless admitted to the counsel for the
prosecution, that no other substance in nature but arsenic could produce
the same effects as it with the whole three tests in succession.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Reduction process.</i>—The process by reduction of arsenic to the
metallic state, as applied to the poison in a state of solution, consists
in separating the whole arsenic by a liquid test in such a state as to
admit of the precipitated compound being subjected to the process
of reduction and sublimation. The best method of the kind is a
modification of one described by me in 1824.<a id='r523' /><a href='#f523' class='c013'><sup>[523]</sup></a> This consists in
throwing down the whole arsenic in the form of sulphuret by means
of hydrosulphuric acid, converting the sulphuret by the process of
reduction to the metallic state, and oxidating the metal thus procured.
The hydrosulphuric acid is preferred to other liquid reagents, because
the precipitate it forms, while possessing a very characteristic colour,
is also more bulky than those caused by the other tests, and is therefore
more easily collected,—and because its action is not liable to
be prevented or obscured by so many disturbing causes. The steps
of the process are the following:—</p>

<p class='c006'>The fluid to be examined must be acidulated with acetic or hydrochloric
acid. If the fluid be neutral or alkaline, the acid may be
added at once. If on the other hand the fluid redden litmus, and
the acid be either unknown or a mineral acid, potash must first be
added in a slight excess, and then the alkali must be supersaturated
with acetic or hydrochloric acid. The reasons for these precautions
are stated under hydrosulphuric acid as a liquid reagent. The fluid
being thus prepared, it is subjected to a stream of hydrosulphuric
acid gas for ten or fifteen minutes. The first portions of the gas
turn the arsenical solution to a bright lemon-yellow colour, and the
subsequent portions throw down a yellow flocculent sulphuret of
arsenic. If the proportion of oxide in solution is small, a yellowness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>or yellow milkiness only is caused, owing to the sulphuret being
soluble in an excess of hydrosulphuric acid. But on expelling that excess
by boiling, a distinct precipitate and colourless fluid are produced.
The precipitate is then to be collected thus. The precipitate is allowed
to subside, and the supernatant fluid being withdrawn, the remainder
is poured into a filter. When all the fluid has passed through, the
portions of precipitate on the upper part of the filter are washed down
to the bottom. The filter is then gently compressed between folds
of bibulous paper, and the sulphuret removed with the point of a
knife before it dries, and dried in little masses on a watch-glass by
the side of a chamber-fire, or still better in a vapour-bath. In this
way it is very easy to collect a twenty-fifth part of a grain of the
sulphuret. Another method which takes more time, but will enable
the least skilful person to collect extremely small quantities, is to
allow the sulphuret to subside in the original fluid in which it is
formed, to pour off the supernatant liquid, and pour the remainder
into a small glass tube, Fig. 7. After the precipitate has thoroughly
subsided, the supernatant liquid is to be withdrawn, and its place
filled up with boiling water. The operation of alternate subsidence
and affusion being repeated a sufficient number of times, the last
portions of water should be gently driven off by heat, and wiped off
the inside of the tube as the drops condense on it. Finally, the
bottom of the tube, with the precipitate attached, is to be cut away
with the file, and broken into small fragments with the view of preserving
the whole sulphuret for the process of reduction. The sulphuret
having been collected in either of these ways, it is now to be
dropt into the tube, Fig. 3, and covered by means of the funnel,
Fig. 4, with soda-flux. The process in other particulars is the same
with that for reducing solid oxide of arsenic.</p>

<p class='c006'>This method of investigation gives extremely precise results, because
it presents the poison successively in three distinct forms, as
sulphuret, metal, and crystallized oxide, all of which possess very
prominent and characteristic external properties. It is also a method
which is capable of detecting very minute quantities of oxide of
arsenic. And it has the advantage over the process by liquid reagents
of being applicable to organic fluids. It was accordingly followed
in most medico-legal researches until the recent discovery of the methods
of Marsh and Reinsch.</p>

<p class='c006'>In order to render it quite satisfactory, it is necessary to go through
the steps of the analysis at the same time with distilled water, lest
any of the reagents used should accidentally contain arsenic.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Process of Marsh.</i>—This method consists in disengaging arsenic
from the solution in the form of arseniuretted-hydrogen gas, burning
the gas in such way as to obtain either metallic arsenic or oxide of
arsenic, and subjecting the product to various tests.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have called this beautiful method of analysis Marsh’s process,
because it appears to me that injustice has been done its discoverer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>both by himself and those who have since investigated the subject,
when they denominated it merely a test. Medico-legal analysis
stood in no need of a new test for arsenic, but very much of an easy
and infallible method of detaching minute quantities of it in a state
of purity from simple and compound fluids, so as to admit of its
being accurately examined. It is this important object, and not
strictly speaking a new test, that has been attained through means of
the discovery of Mr. Marsh.</p>

<p class='c006'>His discovery consists in the observation, that, if hydrogen gas be
disengaged by the action of sulphuric acid or zinc in a fluid containing
arsenic dissolved in any form, arseniuretted-hydrogen gas is disengaged
along with the hydrogen; and that if the two gases be burnt
together in a fine flame, metallic arsenic is deposited on a white
porcelain surface held in the flame, and oxide of arsenic if the porcelain
be held immediately above it.<a id='r524' /><a href='#f524' class='c013'><sup>[524]</sup></a> The production of a brilliant
mirror-like crust in the former case, and of a white powdery one in
the other, constituted Marsh’s test as originally proposed; and it was
at first conceived to furnish unimpeachable evidence of the detection
of arsenic. Afterwards many inquirers, and among them the discoverer
himself, became satisfied that certain fallacies stand in the way
of a conclusion based on such simple premises. Various supplementary
tests were in consequence proposed. And at length it seems to
be agreed, that the proper mode of applying Marsh’s discovery is
to employ a succession of tests, of which that originally pointed out
by him is the first. A vast variety of methods of analysis founded
on this principle have been proposed by British and continental chemists.
It would be tedious and unprofitable to discuss or even to
state them here. The reader will probably be satisfied with a reference
to the most important of them<a id='r525' /><a href='#f525' class='c013'><sup>[525]</sup></a> and with a description of that
process, which appears to me, from repeated trials in medico-legal
practice, to be at once most convenient, delicate, and conclusive.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let the liquid to be examined be introduced into a Döbereiner’s
lamp [Fig. 10], or an apparatus constructed with a bottle and a funnel
upon the same principle [Fig. 11]; and dilute the liquid with distilled
water, until the lower cavity of the apparatus be nearly full,
leaving space however for the tube of the funnel, a fragment of
zinc, and some sulphuric acid. Put in a cylinder or rod of zinc, <i>a</i>;
and then add sulphuric acid until a moderate effervescence ensue.
Close the junction of the two vessels, and then, allowing a little
gas to escape at <i>c</i>, shut the stop-cock, and let the gas fill the vessel
A, by driving the liquid up into B. Having meanwhile fitted
by a cork to the exit-tube, <i>c</i>, the glass tube, <i>d e</i>, which is loosely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>stuffed with raw cotton at the end <i>d g</i>, and has a bent plate of
copper or tinned iron hung over it at <i>f</i>,—open the stop-cock, allow
a little gas to escape so as to expel the air in <i>d e</i>, and then kindle
the gas at <i>e</i>, which must be contracted to a capillary opening.
Keep the flame low, and hold the surface of a white porcelain
vessel across the middle of it for a few seconds. If no stain be
produced on the porcelain, there is no arsenic in the fluid. If a
stain be formed, regulate the escape of gas by the stop-cock so that
the fluid may not rise above the middle of the lower vessel of the
apparatus, and apply the heat of a spirit-lamp flame to the tube
<i>d e</i> on the left hand of the plate <i>f</i>, the purpose of which is to prevent
the heat being communicated beyond that point. By and
by, if there be arsenic in the fluid, a brilliant metallic ring will
appear beyond <i>f</i>, owing to decomposition of arseniuretted-hydrogen
gas. As soon as the crust is thick enough to present its properties
characteristically, withdraw the spirit-lamp; place the tube <i>e h</i>
so that the flame at <i>e</i> shall be completely within the ball, <i>i</i>; let the
tube incline very slightly in the direction from <i>k</i> to <i>l</i>; and allow a
stream of cold water to trickle down upon the portion <i>k l</i>, which
should be wrapped in a single layer of calico. Oxide of arsenic
will gradually condense, partly in white powder or minute sparkling
crystals in the ball and between <i>i</i> and <i>k</i>, and partly between <i>k</i> and
<i>l</i> in the form of a solution, which collects at the bend <i>l</i>. The
solution which may be increased in quantity by boiling a little distilled
water upon the powder in the ball and bend <i>i k</i>, is then to
be subjected in small portions to the three liquid reagents, ammoniacal
nitrate of silver, ammoniacal sulphate of copper, and hydrosulphuric
acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some experience is required to apply this process successfully.
But with due attention it furnishes conclusive evidence with great
delicacy and precision. A solution containing only a millionth part
of oxide of arsenic will part with it readily in the form of arseniuretted-hydrogen;
and the slightest trace of that gas in the hydrogen
is indicated by the method recommended above.—The process
is compounded of Mr. Marsh’s original discovery, the supplementary
test of reduction in the exit-tube recommended by Berzelius,<a id='r526' /><a href='#f526' class='c013'><sup>[526]</sup></a>
and the formation and examination of the oxide proposed by
myself.<a id='r527' /><a href='#f527' class='c013'><sup>[527]</sup></a>—With certain precautions and modes of manipulating, it
is applicable to the most complex organic fluids, as well as to simple
solutions.</p>

<p class='c006'>The discovery of Mr. Marsh had not been long made before the
test in its original simple form was found liable to divers important
fallacies. It appeared, for example, that antimony yields very nearly
the same appearance of metallic crust and of white powder, according
to the position of the porcelain in the flame; that some porcelains
glazed with oxide of zinc are similarly stained by a flame of simple
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>hydrogen gas; that a great variety of metallic salts, if spirted up
into the exit-tube, undergo reduction in the flame, and cause imitative
stains on the porcelain; that iron-salts seems to form stains
from the same chemical action as what occurs in the case of arsenic;
and that certain compounds of phosphorous acid with ammonia and
animal matter, or even mere animal matters themselves, will in
some circumstances produce a stain more or less similar to that
which is occasioned by arsenic.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is no doubt, that the resemblance of most of these spurious
stains to an arsenical crust has been much exaggerated. But still
the similarity is sufficient to satisfy every impartial judge, that the
mere production of a brilliant metallic, or white powdery stain, or
both, upon porcelain, is not conclusive evidence of the detection of
arsenic in medico-legal inquiries. It is strong presumptive evidence;
and the non-production of such stains is absolute proof that arsenic
is not present. But in order to obtain irrefragable proof of its presence,
the substance which forms the crusts and stains must be subjected
to farther examination. And such is the object of the supplementary
methods in the process detailed above. That process is
perfectly free of fallacy. No substance yet known but arsenic can
yield the succession of phenomena which have been detailed. My
opinion farther is, that the process may be safely simplified by withdrawing
Berzelius’s supplementary test of reduction in the exit-tube,
and retaining the test of oxidation only, with the examination of the
oxide by liquid reagents. I have retained the former in deference
to the opinion expressed by a committee appointed by the French
Institute, who examined the whole subject with unwearied zeal, but who,
it may be observed, seem never to have had in their view the check-test
of oxidation; which, with the consecutive tests, is superior in
conclusiveness to the check of reduction only.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Reinsch’s process</i>, like the former, has been inconveniently called
a new test for arsenic. The fact discovered by Dr. Reinsch is valueless
as supplying a mere test; but it forms the ground-work of the
best process of all yet proposed for the detection of arsenic in solution.
The discovery is, that arsenic in solution is deposited in the
metallic state upon copper-leaf, when the fluid is acidulated with hydrochloric
acid, and heated till it boils gently or is about to do so;
and that by heating the copper gently in a glass tube the arsenic is
sublimed from it in the form of oxide or metal according to the quantity
present.<a id='r528' /><a href='#f528' class='c013'><sup>[528]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>This method is so simple and easy as scarcely to require any detailed
explanation. The fluid should contain about a tenth of its volume
of hydrochloric acid. It must be heated near ebullition before
the copper is introduced, otherwise the copper becomes tarnished,
though arsenic be not present. Copper-leaf, or copper-plate worn
thin by the action of diluted nitric acid, or fine copper gauze, is the
best form for use. In the feeblest solutions ten or fifteen minutes
elapse before arsenic is visibly deposited, and forty minutes should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>be allowed for strong deposition; but in strong solutions, the action
takes place in a few seconds. The result is a thin, brittle
brilliant, steel like coating of metallic arsenic. As soon as the deposit
is formed, the copper is to be removed, dried with a gentle
heat, cut into small shreds, and heated with a spirit-lamp in the
smallest glass tube that will conveniently contain the whole; upon
which a metallic ring of arsenic is sometimes sublimed, but more
generally a ring of small sparkling crystals. These are first to be examined
as to their form with a common pocket lens; and then dissolved
in boiling distilled water, after shaking out the copper, so
that a solution may be obtained and subjected to the liquid reagents,
especially the ammoniacal nitrate of silver as being the readiest and
most delicate. In all medico-legal inquiries it is necessary to perform
a preliminary experiment with distilled water and the hydrochloric
acid used, lest the acid contain arsenic.</p>

<p class='c006'>The process here described is one which I have followed with
great facility, certainty and despatch in several medico-legal cases.<a id='r529' /><a href='#f529' class='c013'><sup>[529]</sup></a>
It is extremely delicate; for it will detect at least a 250,000th part
of arsenic in solution; and it removes from the fluid every particle
of arsenic, because none can be afterwards discovered by means
even of Marsh’s method. It is not subject to any fallacy. The
mere formation of a brilliant coating on the copper is not evidence of
arsenic being present; for as Reinsch himself ascertained, solutions
of bismuth, tin, zinc, and antimony produce a coating more or less
similar to an arsenical one. But the farther steps of the process entirely
put aside all these sources of error. The non-formation of a
metallic tarnish of copper, however, is perhaps not absolute proof of the
absence of arsenic. For, according to a late statement by Drs. Fresenius
and Von Babo,<a id='r530' /><a href='#f530' class='c013'><sup>[530]</sup></a> “all nitrates, and various salts of mercury
and other metals, render the separation of arsenic by copper difficult
or even impossible.” The authors of this objection, although the
paper is otherwise elaborate and detailed, have not given any particulars
in illustration of so important a criticism.</p>

<h6 class='c011'><i>Of the Tests for Oxide of Arsenic in Organic Mixtures.</i></h6>

<p class='c012'>The present is by far the most important of the conditions under
which it may be necessary to search for arsenic in medico-legal cases;
for in nine cases out of ten the subject of analysis is either some
article of food or drink, the contents or tissues of the stomach, or
the textures of other organs of the body into which the poison has
been carried by absorption.</p>

<p class='c006'>Accordingly much attention has been paid to this subject for some
years past, and many valuable methods of analysis have been suggested,
more especially since the recent discovery that arsenic, like
many other poisons, undergo absorption, and is diffused by the circulation
throughout the body generally. It was proved by me in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>1824,<a id='r531' /><a href='#f531' class='c013'><sup>[531]</sup></a> that the tests for arsenic, at that time in general use, are so
fallacious when applied to complex organic mixtures as to be unfit
for medico-legal investigations except merely as trial-tests; and a
process was proposed, which has since undergone various modifications
from others as well as myself. This process, in the form
in which it was adopted in the last edition of the present
work, is still applicable to a great proportion of cases; and indeed
a recent modification of it has been thought by Drs. Fresenius and
von Babo to be superior even yet to every other in all circumstances.<a id='r532' /><a href='#f532' class='c013'><sup>[532]</sup></a>
But two new methods are at present generally preferred,
and probably not without reason. At least they have been much
employed and with great success in numerous medico-legal researches,
where the quantity of arsenic was to all appearance extremely
small, and the subject of examination most complex and
troublesome to bring within the sphere of analysis. And in particular
they have been successfully employed to detect arsenic in those
organs of the human body into which it can obtain admission only
through the medium of absorption.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the following statement I shall describe four processes only,
that of Reinsch, by which the arsenic is first separated as a crust on
copper,—that of Marsh, who first detaches it in the form of arseniuretted-hydrogen,—my
own method, which consists in obtaining in
the first instance a sulphuret of arsenic,—and that of Drs. Fresenius
and von Babo, which has the same foundation.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Process of Reinsch.</i>—This is the simplest and easiest of all. Remove
in the first place any white or gray powder which can be detached
from the mixture; and either subject it to the process of reduction
by charcoal or soda-flux, as described at p. <a href='#Page_203'>203</a>, or dissolve
it in boiling distilled water and subject the solution to the three
liquid reagents, p. <a href='#Page_207'>207</a>, or if there be enough, examine it in both
ways. If arsenic be thus obtained, it is seldom necessary to proceed
any farther. But if not, cut all soft solids into small fragments, add
distilled water if necessary, then add hydrochloric acid to the
amount of a tenth of the whole mixture, and more if the subject of
analysis be decayed and ammoniacal, so that there may be a decided
excess of acid. Boil gently for an hour, or until all soft solids be
either dissolved or broken down into fine flakes and grains. Filter
through calico; bring the filtered fluid again to the boiling point;
and then proceed as described for Reinsch’s method in simple arsenical
solutions [p. <a href='#Page_214'>214</a>].</p>

<p class='c006'>The only important precaution to be attended to in employing this
process is to take care that the water, hydrochloric acid, and calico
are free of accidental impregnation with arsenic. This is guarded
against by applying the process to them in the first instance. I have
lately employed this method of analysis with success in two medico-legal
cases where the bodies had been buried for several months, and
where the quantity of arsenic must have been very minute. Satisfactory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>evidence was obtained from a sixth part of the stomach, and
also from the same proportion of the liver.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Process of Marsh.</i>—The chief difficulties in applying the process
of Marsh to complex organic mixtures arise from the tendency of
oxide of arsenic to adhere with obstinacy to some organic principles
in the solid state, and from the liability of the gas disengaged in the
apparatus to raise organic fluids in a fine froth, which breaks up
slowly, and is therefore apt to pass over into the exit-tube. Many
contrivances have been devised, to meet these difficulties, especially
by the French chemists and toxicologists, whose attention was turned
earnestly to the subject by the investigations carried on in certain
late criminal trials of great interest and importance. The various
devices now alluded to were subjected to trial in 1841 by a Committee
of the French Institute; who came to the opinion that the following
method suggested by MM. Flandin and Danger is the most convenient
and comprehensive.<a id='r533' /><a href='#f533' class='c013'><sup>[533]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Heat the organic matter with a sixth of its weight of strong sulphuric
acid; when complete solution has taken place, concentrate the
fluid to a friable almost dry charcoal; add a little concentrated nitric
acid gradually to this when cold, and again evaporate to dryness;
then act on the residue with boiling distilled water, and a solution of
a reddish-brown colour is obtained, which may be used in such an
apparatus as that of Döbereiner without risk of obstruction from froth.—The
arseniuretted-hydrogen, thus disengaged along with the hydrogen
gas, is to be submitted to the succession of tests described in
speaking of Marsh’s process for detecting arsenic in a state of simple
solution [p. <a href='#Page_212'>212</a>].</p>

<p class='c006'>This method of investigation is exceedingly precise and conclusive.
The sulphuric acid aided by heat destroys organic matter sufficiently
to prevent frothing in the apparatus and dissolves out arsenic from a
state of combination with organic principles; and nitric acid afterwards
converts any arsenic in the half-charred mass into the soluble
arsenic acid. It has been employed with success in various medico-legal
proceedings in France. It answers well for detecting oxide of
arsenic in the viscera, muscles, and other parts of the body into which
the poison has been conveyed through absorption.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Process by Hydrosulphuric Acid.</i>—This method may be employed
in two ways, according as the object is merely to prove the presence
of oxide of arsenic, or to ascertain also its quantity.</p>

<p class='c006'>a. If proof of its presence be all that is wanted, cut any soft solids
into small pieces, add distilled water if necessary, boil for half an
hour, let the decoction cool, and filter it. Add a little acetic acid to
the filtered fluid, and if any precipitate form, filter again. Evaporate
to dryness, first by ebullition, afterwards over the vapour-bath. Dissolve
the residuum again in repeated portions of boiling distilled
water, and filter the solution. If it be not acid to litmus-paper add
more acetic acid, and transmit hydrosulphuric acid gas through the
fluid until an excess be indicated by the sense of smell after agitation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Then expel the excess of gas by boiling; and if the precipitate of
sulphuret of arsenic do not subside readily add a little of a strong
solution of hydrochlorate of ammonia, which will facilitate subsidence.
When the precipitate has fallen to the bottom, withdraw the supernatant
fluid with the pipette, Fig. 8; and replace it with a little
boiling distilled water. Lastly, collect the precipitate on a filter, and
proceed as by the reduction process with soda-flux for oxide of arsenic,
in a state of simple solution.</p>

<p class='c006'>This method answers very well for ordinary cases where the quantity
of arsenic is not extremely minute. But I have met with instances
in medico-legal practice where the process of Reinsch, as
well as that of Marsh, succeeded in detecting the poison in sources
to which the method by hydrosulphuric acid had been applied
without avail; because apparently the organic matter existing in solution
prevented the action of the gas, or, as Orfila thinks, because
boiling water will not in all circumstances remove oxide of arsenic
from the textures of the animal body which are impregnated with it.
In particular I doubt whether this method is sufficiently delicate to
detect arsenic in those organs and textures into which it has been
conveyed in cases of poisoning through absorption into the blood.—Another
objection is its tediousness. The first filtration, if the substance
to be examined be the stomach or its contents, may take two
days; and one way or another the analysis can seldom be completed
within four days. Reinsch’s process may be brought to a conclusion
in two hours or less, even in the most difficult circumstances.</p>

<p class='c006'>b. The last process to be mentioned, is one based, like the previous
one, upon the precipitation of arsenic in the form of sulphuret,
but with very material modifications, the purpose of which is to
enable the analyst to separate the whole arsenic in a state of purity,
so as to ascertain the exact amount of the poison in the mixture.
This method has been recently proposed by Drs. Fresenius and von
Babo.<a id='r534' /><a href='#f534' class='c013'><sup>[534]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Cut any soft solids into small pieces, put the whole into a porcelain
basin, add as much hydrochloric acid as equals the probable weight
of the dry matter in the mixture, and then water enough to form a
thin pulp. Heat the basin over the vapour-bath, adding every five
minutes about half a drachm of chlorate of potass, and stirring frequently,
until the liquid become clear-yellow, homogeneous, and
thin. Add now two drachms more of the chlorate; filter through
linen, washing the residuum on the filter with boiling water; concentrate
to a pound; add a strong solution of sulphurous acid till its
odour predominates, and expel the excess of it by heat. The liquid
is now ready for the transmission of hydrosulphuric acid gas, which
should be transmitted in a slow stream for twelve hours. Wash
away any sulphuret adhering to the tube by means of ammonia, and
add the solution to the principal liquid; which is next to be left at a
gentle heat about 80° F., in a vessel covered with paper, till the sulphureous
smell entirely disappear. The precipitate, which contains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>organic matter as well as sulphuret, is then to be collected on a paper
filter, washed, and dried with the filter over the vapour-bath. The
animal matter is next destroyed, and the sulphuret converted into arsenic
acid, by dropping on it fuming nitrous acid till the whole is moistened,
drying the product thoroughly over the vapour-bath, moistening
the residuum with concentrated sulphuric acid, heating the mixture
again in the vapour-bath for two or three hours, and raising the heat
afterwards gradually in a sand-bath to 300° F., till a charred brittle
mass be obtained. This is to be heated over the vapour-bath with
twenty parts of distilled water, filtered, and washed with boiling
water on the filter till what passes through ceases to redden litmus.
The solution, which ought to be colourless, is next acidulated with
hydrochloric acid, and treated as formerly with hydrosulphuric acid
gas. When the sulphuret has been collected on a small filter, diluted
ammonia is to be sent through the filter as long as it dissolves
any sulphuret, and is to be received in a weighed porcelain basin,
in which the ammonia and water are to be driven off at a temperature
not exceeding 212°. The sulphuret which is alone left may now be
weighed by again weighing the basin; and one grain of sulphuret is
equivalent to 0·803 of a grain of oxide of arsenic.—The authors
add an elaborate process for obtaining from this the whole arsenic by
reduction. But such a proceeding is unnecessary. It is sufficient in
medico-legal inquiries to ascertain by the simpler method given above
[p. <a href='#Page_204'>204</a>], that it does yield by reduction with soda-flux a true arsenical
crust, and that this yields by oxidation white, sparkling crystals with
triangular facettes.</p>

<p class='c006'>After a comparative trial of the most esteemed process, Drs. Fresenius
and von Babo state that they found the one now described as
delicate as any other, and the only method by which the quantity of
oxide of arsenic can be ascertained with accuracy.—The hydrochloric
acid used at the commencement enables the water to dissolve
compounds of arsenic which water alone will not act on; and it
farther facilitates solution by breaking up or dissolving organic textures.
The addition of chlorate of potash prevents the escape of oxide
of arsenic during the subsequent evaporation; which is apt to happen
when hydrochloric acid is present. The subsequent addition of sulphuric
acid converts arsenic acid into arsenious acid, in which shape
the sulphuret of arsenic is more readily formed by the action of hydrosulphuric
acid gas, when organic matter co-exists in the solution.
The steps for destroying organic matter thrown down with the sulphuret
at its first formation require no further commentary: They are
the most important particulars in the process for its main object,—the
determination of the quantity of pure sesqui-sulphuret, and, through
it, of the sesquioxide originally in the subject of analysis.</p>

<h6 class='c011'><i>Of certain alleged Fallacies in the case of Organic Mixtures.</i></h6>

<p class='c012'>Before taking leave of the detection of arsenic in organic mixtures,
it is necessary to notice certain alleged fallacies in the way of every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>process, arising from arsenic obtaining admission into the subject of
analysis through other means than its intentional addition or its introduction
as a poison into the body. This topic, one of paramount
importance in medico-legal chemistry, has lately undergone careful
investigation during and since the notorious trial of Madame Lafarge.
The results are the following:—</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been alleged that arsenic may obtain accidental admission
into the subject of analysis, 1, because the reagents used in the processes
may be adulterated with arsenic; 2, because the material of
the apparatus may contain it; 3, because it may have existed in antidotes
administered during life; 4, because it sometimes forms a
constituent part of the human body in the natural state; and 5, because
it exists in the soil of some churchyards.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <i>Arsenic may exist as an adulteration in some reagents.</i>—It must
be apt to occur in <i>sulphuric acid</i>, when that substance is prepared
with pyritic sulphur, which commonly contains some sulphuret of
arsenic; and it has actually been found in abundance in the acid by
various experimentalists, and in England for the first time by Dr.
Rees.<a id='r535' /><a href='#f535' class='c013'><sup>[535]</sup></a> It may be detected by transmitting hydrosulphuric acid gas
through the diluted acid; and it may be effectually removed in the
same way,<a id='r536' /><a href='#f536' class='c013'><sup>[536]</sup></a> the acid being afterwards filtered in a funnel whose throat
is filled with asbestus, and the excess of gas being expelled by heat.—<i>Hydrochloric
acid</i> may contain arsenic, because it may have been
prepared with an arsenicated sulphuric acid. The impurity may be
detected and removed in the same way as in that substance. Nitric
acid seems not apt to be similarly adulterated;<a id='r537' /><a href='#f537' class='c013'><sup>[537]</sup></a> but it may be tested
by Marsh’s process, after neutralizing the acid with potash, and adding
more sulphuric acid than is required to decompose the nitre thus
formed. <i>Zinc</i> occasionally contains a little arsenic, which will be
evolved in Marsh’s process. Dr. Clark of Aberdeen says zinc is
scarcely ever free of a trace of arsenic; and it has been occasionally
detected by others. Orfila, however, very seldom found so much as
to be discoverable by Marsh’s test applied continuously for a great
length of time.<a id='r538' /><a href='#f538' class='c013'><sup>[538]</sup></a> A committee of the French Institute came to the
same conclusion.<a id='r539' /><a href='#f539' class='c013'><sup>[539]</sup></a> M. Jaquelain, acting under the directions of
Professor Dumas, could not detect an atom in any French specimen
of zinc, or its carbonate or silicated oxide, as met with in commerce.<a id='r540' /><a href='#f540' class='c013'><sup>[540]</sup></a>
Lastly, Mr. Brett satisfied himself that no British or foreign zinc he
could obtain indicated the presence of arsenic by a process capable
of detecting a 5000th of that metal in zinc.<a id='r541' /><a href='#f541' class='c013'><sup>[541]</sup></a> It is an obvious inference
from all these inquiries that no difficulty can be experienced
in obtaining zinc so pure as to exhibit not a trace of arsenic by
Marsh’s method. Neither is there any difficulty in obtaining sulphuric,
muriatic, and nitric acid free of that adulteration.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>But at the same time it is equally obvious, that in medico-legal analyses,
unless the reagents used be previously known to be free of
arsenic, they ought invariably to be subjected in the first instance to
the process, whatever it may be, which the analyst proposes to employ
for detecting arsenic in a suspected substance.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. <i>Arsenic may be present in some articles of chemical apparatus.</i>—Arsenic
has been detected in the metal of cast-iron pots,<a id='r542' /><a href='#f542' class='c013'><sup>[542]</sup></a> which
Orfila and others have proposed to employ in certain analyses on the
large scale, as, for example, when the poison is sought for in the whole
soft solids of the human body. It is denied, however, that any of that
arsenic can be dissolved out of cast-iron by the process which has
been followed in such circumstances.<a id='r543' /><a href='#f543' class='c013'><sup>[543]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The primary fact, and the qualification of it, are in my opinion of
equally little medico-legal importance. It is not likely that such
enormous masses of material will ever be operated on again, as those
which were made use of in some late, French trials, and for which
great iron pots were found indispensable;—because it has been
proved that absorbed arsenic is chiefly to be met with in particular
organs or secretions, such as the liver and urine. Besides, a false importance
has been attached to the enthusiastic analyses of the whole
human carcase, with which some French chemists have been astounding
the minds of the scientific world, as well as the vulgar, on the
occasion of certain late trials for poisoning. I confess I could not
find fault with a jury, who might decline to put faith in the evidence
of poisoning with arsenic, when the analyst, after boiling an entire
body, with many gallons of water, in a huge iron cauldron, making
use of whole pounds of sulphuric acid, nitric acid, and nitre, and
toiling for days and weeks at the process, could do no more than
produce minute traces of the poison. What man of common sense
will believe, that, with such bulky materials and crude apparatus, it
is possible to guard to a certainty against the accidental admission
of a little arsenic? At all events I am much mistaken if any British
jury would condemn a prisoner on such evidence,—or any British
chemist find fault with them for declining to do so.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. <i>Arsenic may have existed in antidotes administered during life.</i>—It
is now generally known, that the only chemical antidote for
arsenic is the hydrated sesquioxide of iron. But this substance appears
occasionally to contain a little arsenic, obviously derived from
the compound of iron whence the oxide is prepared.<a id='r544' /><a href='#f544' class='c013'><sup>[544]</sup></a> Such an adulteration
must be rare in what is prepared by the ordinary processes,
according to which the oxide of arsenic ought to remain in solution.
The only effectual mode, however, of guarding against this source of
error, when the antidote has been administered, is to examine a
portion of the stock whence the patient was supplied, by dissolving
it in an excess of sulphuric acid, and subjecting it to Marsh’s test.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. <i>Arsenic sometimes exists naturally in the human body.</i>—This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>startling proposition was first advanced by M. Couerbe, and by
Professor Orfila soon afterwards.<a id='r545' /><a href='#f545' class='c013'><sup>[545]</sup></a> The latter subsequently stated,
that it exists only in the bones, and not in any of the soft solids.<a id='r546' /><a href='#f546' class='c013'><sup>[546]</sup></a>
It is now clear, however, that both of these experimentalists must
have committed an error. Orfila himself admits that his early researches
are vitiated by the subsequent discovery of arsenic in some
kinds of sulphuric acid;<a id='r547' /><a href='#f547' class='c013'><sup>[547]</sup></a> and all recent attempts by others to obtain
his results have failed. Thus MM. Flandin and Danger could not
detect arsenic in any part of the human body, when it had not been
administered:<a id='r548' /><a href='#f548' class='c013'><sup>[548]</sup></a> Pfaff was unable to detect an atom of it in the bones
of man or the lower animals by Orfila’s own process:<a id='r549' /><a href='#f549' class='c013'><sup>[549]</sup></a> Dr. Rees
was equally unsuccessful:<a id='r550' /><a href='#f550' class='c013'><sup>[550]</sup></a> and in 1841 a committee of the
French Institute, who superintended the performance of an analysis
in three cases by Orfila, reported that he failed in every instance
to find a trace of arsenic, by a process which could detect a
65th part of a grain intentionally mixed with an avoirdupois pound
of bones.<a id='r551' /><a href='#f551' class='c013'><sup>[551]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>There is the strongest possible presumption, therefore, that
human bones never contain any arsenic. And besides, supposing
they did, the source of fallacy would be utterly insignificant; for,
when it becomes necessary to search for arsenic absorbed into the
textures of the body, it is never necessary to have recourse to the
bones.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. <i>Arsenic may exist in the soil of churchyards.</i>—This proposition
too was first announced by Professor Orfila, who found a little in the
churchyard of Villey-sur-Tille, near Dijon, and of the Bicêtre, Mont-Parnasse,
and New Botanic Garden at Paris.<a id='r552' /><a href='#f552' class='c013'><sup>[552]</sup></a> And although MM.
Flandin and Danger afterwards denied they could ever find any,<a id='r553' /><a href='#f553' class='c013'><sup>[553]</sup></a>
a committee of the Parisian Academy of Medicine reported that
Orfila proved before them the accuracy of his statement.<a id='r554' /><a href='#f554' class='c013'><sup>[554]</sup></a> But the
arsenic exists in a state in which it cannot be dissolved out by boiling
water: It has been hitherto separable only by boiling the churchyard
mould with concentrated sulphuric acid. Hence it cannot pass by
percolation through a coffin into a body; and consequently it becomes
a source of fallacy only when the coffin has been broken up in the
course of time, and the mould lies in actual contact with the organs
to be analysed.<a id='r555' /><a href='#f555' class='c013'><sup>[555]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It plainly appears, then, that most of the fallacies alleged against the
validity of the evidence derived from the discovery of arsenic within
the human body in cases of poisoning have no real existence; and
that those which are real can easily be provided against by simple
and obvious precautions.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>
  <h5 class='c011'>3. <i>Arsenite of Copper</i>.</h5>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The arsenite of copper [Scheele’s-green, Mineral-green] deserves
notice, because it is in use as a pigment, and has actually been used
as a poison. Dr. Duncan once detected it in pills, given to a pregnant
female with the view of procuring abortion; in Paris it has
been detected in sweetmeats, having been used to give them a fine
green colour;<a id='r556' /><a href='#f556' class='c013'><sup>[556]</sup></a> and Mr. Ainley of Bingley in Yorkshire informs me
he found it to constitute a pigment sold by London pastry-cooks under
the name of emerald-green for colouring preserves, and which in his
practice had proved poisonous to children who had eaten apple-tarts
coloured with it.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is a compound of arsenious acid and deutoxide of copper, is sold
in powder or pulverulent cakes, and has a pale grass-green colour.
Its nature may be ascertained by heating it in a glass tube. Crystals
of oxide of arsenic sublime, and oxide of copper remains, which, on
being dissolved in nitric acid, yields a fine violet-blue solution with
ammonia.</p>

<p class='c006'>The mineral-green of the shops, however, is seldom arsenite of copper.
The substance sold in Edinburgh under that name, although
believed by colourmen to be a preparation of arsenic, is not the arsenite
of copper, but a mixture of hydrated oxide of copper and carbonate
of lime; which will be mentioned more particularly under the
head of the poisons of copper.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Process for Organic Mixtures.</i>—The suspected mixture is to be
heated with a little hydrochloric acid and well stirred. The arsenite
being thus dissolved, the solution is to be allowed to cool and then
filtered. A stream of hydrosulphuric-acid gas will now cause a
dark-brown or yellowish-brown muddiness or precipitate, which is a
mixture of sulphuret of copper and sulphuret of arsenic. The precipitate
being separated after boiling, and properly cleansed by the
process of subsidence and affusion, or if it is large, by washing on a
filter, the two sulphurets are to be separated by ammonia, which dissolves
sulphuret of arsenic but leaves the sulphuret of copper; and
the sulphuret of arsenic may be recovered from the filtered fluid by
expelling the ammonia with heat. The sulphuret of arsenic is next
to be reduced as directed at page <a href='#Page_211'>211</a>; and the sulphuret of copper
examined as recommended under the head of copper.</p>

<h5 class='c011'>4. <i>Arsenite of Potass</i>.</h5>

<p class='c012'>This salt is an object of some importance to the medical jurist, as
it forms the basis of a common medicine, Fowler’s Solution, or the
Tasteless Ague Drop. This preparation contains in every ounce
four grains of arsenious acid. It has a brownish-red colour, and an
odour of lavender. It is strongly alkaline to litmus. When acidulated
with hydrochloric acid, hydrosulphuric-acid gas causes in it a
dirty brownish-yellow precipitate; and Reinsch’s process will detach
arsenic from it upon copper in a state capable of being subjected to
the usual tests [see p. <a href='#Page_214'>214</a>].</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>
  <h5 class='c011'>5. <i>Arseniate of Potass.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c012'>This substance is so rarely met with as to be an object of little
consequence to the medical jurist: nevertheless I have found in the
course of reading two instances of poisoning with it. A very dangerous
and tedious case has been related by Professor Bernt, which
arose from too great a quantity having been given medicinally by an
ignorant druggist;<a id='r557' /><a href='#f557' class='c013'><sup>[557]</sup></a> and a case of accidental poisoning with it has
been related in the London Medical Repository.<a id='r558' /><a href='#f558' class='c013'><sup>[558]</sup></a> A singular account
too has been published of the accidental poisoning of seven
horses with it at Paris. They all died, most of them with the symptoms
and morbid appearances of well-marked inflammation of the
alimentary canal.<a id='r559' /><a href='#f559' class='c013'><sup>[559]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>When solid it forms tetraedral prismatic crystals, acuminated by
four planes. It is very soluble in water, fuses at a red heat, and on
cooling concretes into a crumbly, foliaceous mass, having a pearly
lustre. It is easily known by the effect of the process of reduction—of
the nitrate of silver, the salts of copper, and sulphuretted-hydrogen.
Heated with charcoal in a tube it gives off metallic
arsenic in the usual manner; but a stronger heat is required than for
the reduction of the arsenious acid. Dissolved in water and treated
with nitrate of silver it yields a brick-red precipitate, the arseniate of
silver. With the salts of copper its solution gives a pale bluish-white
precipitate, the arseniate of copper. With sulphuretted-hydrogen
gas, preceded by acidulation with muriatic acid, and transmitted
for a considerable length of time, it yields the yellow sulphuret
of arsenic. When in solution it yields arsenic both by Reinsch’s
process and the method of Marsh.</p>

<h5 class='c011'>6. <i>The Sulphurets of Arsenic.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>In the arts various substances are known which contain a compound
of sulphur and arsenic. In the first place, two pure sulphurets
are known in chemistry and in painting, the one of a fine orange
colour, and known by the name of realgar, the other of a rich sulphur-yellow,
and termed orpiment. Secondly, the name of orpiment
is familiarly given to a pigment in more general use than either of
the former, which has a less lively colour, and consists of pure orpiment
with a large admixture of arsenious acid. Lastly, orpiment also
forms a great proportion of another common pigment, King’s yellow.</p>

<p class='c006'>The orange-red sulphuret (realgar, risigallum, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Σανδαραχη</span>, sandaracha),
is chiefly a natural production. It is solid, of a bright
orange-red colour, and composed of small shining scales, so soft as to
be scratched with the nail. It is composed of one equivalent of
metal and one of sulphur. Its best chemical characters are the disengagement
of metallic arsenic when it is heated in a tube with
potass or the black flux; and its undergoing sublimation unchanged
when heated alone in a tube.</p>

<p class='c006'>The yellow sulphuret (orpiment, auripigmentum, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αρσενικον</span>), is both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>a natural production, and the result of many chemical operations.
The sulphuret thrown down from solutions of arsenic by sulphuretted-hydrogen
is quite conformable in physical and chemical characters
with the natural orpiment. Natural orpiment, when in mass, consists
of broad scales of much brilliancy and of a rich yellow colour. It is
composed of two equivalents of metal and three of sulphur. Its
most striking chemical characters are the same with those of realgar,
from which it is distinguished chiefly by its colour.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been stated by Hahnemann in his elaborate work on Arsenic,
that the pure sulphurets are somewhat soluble in water,—that native
orpiment is soluble in 5000 parts of water with the aid of ebullition,
and that artificial orpiment by precipitation is soluble in 600 parts.<a id='r560' /><a href='#f560' class='c013'><sup>[560]</sup></a>
Hahnemann, however, was mistaken in supposing that the water
dissolved these sulphurets. It does not dissolve, but decomposes
them. Very lately M. Decourdemanche has found that, by slow
action in cold water, and much more quickly with the aid of heat,
the arsenical sulphuret is decomposed by virtue of a simultaneous decomposition
of the water, hydrosulphuric acid being evolved and an
oxide of arsenic remaining in solution. And he has farther remarked,
that this change is promoted by the presence of animal and vegetable
principles dissolved in water.<a id='r561' /><a href='#f561' class='c013'><sup>[561]</sup></a> These facts are interesting, as they
explain certain apparent anomalies to be noticed presently in the
physiological properties of the sulphurets.</p>

<p class='c006'>The common orpiment of the shops is not a pure sulphuret like
the natural orpiment, but a much more active substance, a mixture
of orpiment and arsenious acid. It is made by subliming in
close vessels a mixture of sulphur and oxide of arsenic. It is met
with in the shops in two forms, in that of a fine powder possessing a
yellow colour with a faint tint of orange, and in that of concave
masses composed of layers of various tints of white, yellow and
orange, commonly also lined internally with tetraedral white pyramidal
crystals. Till lately it was accounted a variety of sulphuret,
and some ingenious conjectures were made as to the cause of its superior
energy over the other sulphurets as a poison. But M. Guibourt
has proved that it always contains oxide of arsenic, and is commonly
impregnated with it to a very large amount, some parcels containing
so much as 96 per cent.<a id='r562' /><a href='#f562' class='c013'><sup>[562]</sup></a> The inner surface I have often
seen lined with large crystals of pure oxide. In a very interesting
account by Dr. Symonds of Bristol, describing the case of Mrs. Smith,
for whose murder a woman Burdock was executed in that city a few
years ago, it is stated that artificial orpiment was the poison given,
that death took place in a very few hours, and that a sample from the
druggist’s shop where the poison was bought contained on an average
79 per cent. of oxide of arsenic.<a id='r563' /><a href='#f563' class='c013'><sup>[563]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Another impure sulphuret, a good deal used in painting, and a favourite
poison in this country for killing flies, is King’s yellow. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>is sold in the form of a light powder or in loose conical cakes. It
has an intense sulphur-yellow colour. This substance is soluble,
though not entirely, in water, both cold and warm, and forms a colourless
solution, from which, on cooling, or by evaporation, a yellow
powder separates. In this respect it differs essentially from the pure
sulphurets. The solution is not acted on by reagents in the same
way as the solution of arsenious acid. Lime-water and hydrosulphuric
acid have no effect on it, the ammoniacal nitrate of silver causes a
copious dirty brown, and the ammoniacal sulphate of copper a scanty,
dirty lemon-yellow precipitate. I have not seen any account of the
mode of preparing it or an analysis of its composition. But according
to my own experiments it contains a large proportion of sulphuret
of arsenic, a considerable proportion of lime, and about 16 per cent.
of sulphur. Its nature is best shown by the following method of
analysis. Let the powder be agitated in diluted ammonia till the
colour becomes white. The filtered fluid contains the sulphuret of
arsenic, which, on addition of an acid, falls down, and may be separated
and reduced in a tube with the black flux. The remaining white
powder, well freed from adhering sulphuret by washing, is next to
be agitated in diluted acetate or hydrochloric acid and again filtered.
The solution on being neutralized precipitates abundantly with oxalate
of ammonia and the alkaline carbonates, showing that lime was taken
up by the acid: and, as the acid operates without effervescence, the
lime must have been in the caustic state. The powder which remains
after the action of the acid will be found to fuse with a gentle
heat and to burn almost entirely away with a blue flame, emitting
sulphureous vapours. These experiments make it obvious that King’s
yellow contains sulphuret of arsenic, caustic lime, and free sulphur;
and in all probability the lime exists in the form of a triple sulphuret
of lime and arsenic.</p>

<p class='c006'>All the preparations containing the sulphuret of arsenic are interesting
to the medical jurist, but particularly the two impure sulphurets
last mentioned. The King’s yellow above all should be carefully
studied, because on account of its frequent employment as a
fly-poison it has been the source of fatal accidents. It was likewise
taken intentionally a few years ago in this city, and proved fatal in
thirty-six hours. Dr. Duncan also, while he was Professor of Medical
Jurisprudence, met with an instance of an attempt to poison by
mixing King’s yellow with tea; and at the Glasgow Spring Circuit of
1822 a woman was tried for poisoning her child with it.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Process for Organic Mixtures.</i>—If sulphuret of arsenic be present
in such mixtures in appreciable quantity, the particles, owing to
their intense yellow colour, will be visible in any mass which has
not the same tint. From this state of admixture they may be removed
by adding caustic ammonia which dissolves sulphuret of
arsenic; and the solution, on being acidulated with muriatic acid,
will deposit the sulphuret sufficiently pure for undergoing the process
of reduction.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sulphuret of arsenic sometimes exists in small quantity in the stomach,
although the poison was given in the form of oxide; for a portion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>of the oxide is subject to be converted into the sulphuret by
hydrosulphuric acid gas evolved in the stomach after death.<a id='r564' /><a href='#f564' class='c013'><sup>[564]</sup></a> In
every instance of the kind yet carefully examined a large proportion
of the oxide has remained unacted on, although the intense colour of
the mixed sulphuret makes it appear as if that were the only compound
present.</p>

<h5 class='c011'>7. <i>Arseniuretted-Hydrogen.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>This compound presents the form of a colourless gas, possessing a
fetid garlicky odour, a density of nearly 2·7, and great virulence as
a poison. It is mentioned here, because accidental poisoning with it
has happened occasionally within a few years, chiefly owing to the
occasional adulteration of sulphuric acid with arsenic, and the liability
of the arsenic to form arseniuretted-hydrogen when such sulphuric
acid is used to prepare hydrogen gas. Dr. O’Reilly has mentioned
a melancholy instance of a young chemist losing his life in
this way.<a id='r565' /><a href='#f565' class='c013'><sup>[565]</sup></a> Dr. Schlinder of Greifenberg has related another, which
did not prove fatal.<a id='r566' /><a href='#f566' class='c013'><sup>[566]</sup></a> And it is well known that the German chemist
Gehlen lost his life by accidentally breathing arseniuretted-hydrogen
while engaged in examining its chemical properties.<a id='r567' /><a href='#f567' class='c013'><sup>[567]</sup></a> It is an inflammable
body; and its presence in any other gas is easily detected
by burning it according to the method of Marsh.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> II.—<i>Of the Action of Arsenic and the Symptoms it excites in Man.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>It is now generally admitted that arsenic produces in the living
body two classes of phenomena,—or that, like the narcotico-acrids,
it has a twofold action. One action is purely irritant, by virtue of
which it induces inflammation in the alimentary canal and elsewhere.
The other, although it seldom occasions symptoms of narcotism properly
so called, yet obviously consists in a disorder of parts or organs
remote from the seat of its application.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is also the general opinion of toxicologists, that arsenic occasions
death more frequently through means of its remote effects than
in consequence of the local inflammation it excites. In some cases
indeed no symptoms of inflammation occur at all; and in many,
although inflammation is obviously produced, death takes place long
before it has had time to cause material organic injury. Nevertheless
in some, though certainly in comparatively few instances, the local
action, it must be admitted, predominates so much, that the morbid
changes of the part primarily acted on are alone adequate to account
for death.</p>

<p class='c006'>Its chief operation being on organs remote from the part to which
it is applied, a natural object of inquiry is, whether this action results
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>from the poison entering the blood, and so passing to the
remote organs acted on, or simply arises from the organ remotely
affected sympathizing through the medium of the nerves with the
impression made on the organ which is affected primarily. On this
question precise experiments are still wanted. The general opinion
has for some time been that it acts through the blood. And this
view has of late been strengthened by indisputable evidence, that
the poison does enter the blood, and is diffused by it throughout
the body.</p>

<p class='c006'>For a long period chemists sought in vain for arsenic in the animal
tissues and secretions at a distance from the alimentary canal. Such
was the position of matters at the date of the last edition of this work;
in which the failure was ascribed to the methods of analysis then
known not being delicate enough to discover the small quantity of
arsenic which disappears by absorption in cases of poisoning.<a id='r568' /><a href='#f568' class='c013'><sup>[568]</sup></a> That
statement is now referred to, because in a late controversy in France
an attempt was made, by an erroneous quotation of this work, to deprive
Professor Orfila of the honour, which is due to him alone, of
having recently been the first to demonstrate the possibility of detecting
arsenic throughout the organs and secretions generally of the
bodies of men and animals poisoned with it.</p>

<p class='c006'>This most important discovery, pregnant alike with interesting
physiological deductions and valuable medico-legal applications, was
first announced by him to the Parisian Academy of Medicine in January,
1839; when he stated that arsenic is absorbed in such quantity
in cases of poisoning as to admit of being discovered by an improved
process of analysis in various organs and fluids of the body, such as
the liver, spleen, kidneys, muscles, blood, and urine.<a id='r569' /><a href='#f569' class='c013'><sup>[569]</sup></a> In November,
1840, he proved these facts to the satisfaction of a committee of
the academy.<a id='r570' /><a href='#f570' class='c013'><sup>[570]</sup></a> And since then they have been confirmed by others,
not merely in express experiments, but likewise in the familiar experience
of medico-legal practice. The situations where arsenic is met
with in largest quantity are the liver, the spleen, and the urine, but
above all the liver. The precise circumstances in which it may be
found in one or another of these quarters have not yet been determined.
But in most cases of acute arsenical poisoning where the
search has been made at all, it has proved successful in the liver. In
two late instances I have readily found arsenic by the process of
Marsh or Reinsch in the liver after four months’ interment.</p>

<p class='c006'>Since arsenic then is clearly absorbed into the blood, it becomes
an interesting question whether the organization of the blood is
thereby changed. This question cannot be answered with confidence.
But in all probability the blood does undergo some change
in its <i>crasis</i>; for in most cases of acute poisoning that fluid is found
after death in a remarkable state of fluidity [see Section on the Morbid
Appearances]; and Mr. James observed that if venous or arterial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>blood be received into a solution of arsenic, instead of coagulating
in the usual way, a viscous jelly first forms, and lumpy clots separate
afterwards.<a id='r571' /><a href='#f571' class='c013'><sup>[571]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Our knowledge of the affection induced by the remote action of
arsenic is in some respects vague. Toxicologists have for the most
part been satisfied with calling it a disorder of the general nervous
system. When employed to designate the state of collapse which
accompanies or forms the chief feature of acute cases of poisoning
with arsenic, this term is misapplied. The whole train of symptoms
is that not of a general nervous disorder, but simply of depressed
action of the heart. That this is the chief organ remotely acted on
in such cases farther appears probable from certain physiological experiments,
in which it has been remarked, that immediately after
rapid death from arsenic the irritability of the heart was exhausted
or nearly so, while that of the intestines, gullet, and voluntary muscles
continued as usual.<a id='r572' /><a href='#f572' class='c013'><sup>[572]</sup></a> As to the singular symptoms which often
arise in the advanced stage of lingering cases, the term, disorder of
the general nervous system, is more appropriately applied to them.
They clearly indicate a deranged state sometimes of the brain, sometimes
of particular nerves.</p>

<p class='c006'>Arsenic belongs to those poisons which act with nearly the same
energy whatever be the organ or texture to which they are applied.
The experiments of Sproegel,<a id='r573' /><a href='#f573' class='c013'><sup>[573]</sup></a> repeated by Jaeger,<a id='r574' /><a href='#f574' class='c013'><sup>[574]</sup></a> and by Sir Benjamin
Brodie,<a id='r575' /><a href='#f575' class='c013'><sup>[575]</sup></a> leave no doubt, that when applied to a fresh wound
it acts with at least equal rapidity as when swallowed. Although in
such circumstances the signs of irritation are often distinct, yet the
symptoms are on the other hand sometimes more purely narcotic
than by any other mode of administering it,—Sir B. Brodie in
particular having observed loss of sense and motion to be induced,
along with occasional convulsions. Arsenic likewise acts with
energy when applied to the conjunctiva of the eye, as was proved
by Dr. Campbell. It acts too with great energy when inhaled in
the state of vapour into the lungs, or in the form of arseniuretted-hydrogen.
It farther acts with violence through the mucous membrane
of the vagina, producing local inflammation, and the usual
constitutional collapse. These facts were determined experimentally
by the Medical Inspectors of Copenhagen on the occasion of a
singular trial which will be noticed afterwards. Arsenic also acts,
as may easily be conceived, when injected into the rectum. And
farther, it acts as a poison, when it is applied to the surface of
ulcers, yet certainly not under all circumstances. Its power of acting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>through the unbroken skin has been questioned. Jaeger found
that, when it was merely applied and not rubbed on the skin of
animals, it had no effect.<a id='r576' /><a href='#f576' class='c013'><sup>[576]</sup></a> But some cases will be afterwards mentioned
which tend to show that the reverse probably holds in regard
to man. According to the last-mentioned author, who is the only
experimentalist that has hitherto examined the subject consecutively,
arsenic is most active when injected into a vein, or applied to a
fresh wound, or introduced into the sac of the peritonæum; it is
less powerful when taken into the stomach; it is still less energetic
when introduced into the rectum; and it is quite inert when applied
to the nerves.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is a striking fact in the action of that poison that, whatever be
the texture in the body to which it is applied, provided death do not
ensue quickly, it almost always produces symptoms of inflammation in
the stomach; and on inspection after death traces of inflammation
are found in that organ. In some instances of death caused by its
outward application, the inflamed appearance of the stomach has
been greater than in many cases where it had been swallowed.
Sproegel met with a good example of this in a dog killed by a
drachm applied to wounds. The whole stomach and intestines,
outwardly and inwardly, were of a deep-red colour, blood was extravasated
between the membranes, and clots were even found in
the stomach.<a id='r577' /><a href='#f577' class='c013'><sup>[577]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Of the different preparations of arsenic, it may be said in general
terms, that those are most active which are most soluble. In conformity
with what appears to be a general law in toxicology, the metal
itself is inert. It is difficult to put this fairly to the test, because it
is not easy to pulverize the metal without a sufficient quantity being
oxidated to cause poisonous effects. Bayen and Deyeux, however,
found that a drachm carefully prepared might be given in fragments
to dogs without injuring them; and they once gave a cat half an
ounce without any other consequence than temporary loss of flesh.<a id='r578' /><a href='#f578' class='c013'><sup>[578]</sup></a>
Its alloys are also inert. The same experimentalists found it inactive
when combined with tin; and Renault likewise found it inactive
when united with sulphur and iron in the ore mispickel, or
arsenical pyrites.<a id='r579' /><a href='#f579' class='c013'><sup>[579]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It is probable that all the other preparations of arsenic are more or
less deleterious.</p>

<p class='c006'>A difference of opinion prevails as to the power of the sulphurets.
Various statements have been published on the subject. But it may
be sufficient to observe, that in consequence of the poisonous properties
of the sulphurets having been imputed to the oxide, with
which they are often adulterated,—Professor Orfila made some experiments
with native orpiment and realgar, and with the sulphuret
procured by sulphuretted-hydrogen gas (which are all pure sulphurets);
and he found that in doses varying from 40 to 70 grains they
all caused death in two, three, or six days, whether they were applied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>to a wound, or introduced into the stomach.<a id='r580' /><a href='#f580' class='c013'><sup>[580]</sup></a> It may appear
at first view singular that the sulphurets, being insoluble, should be
poisonous; but the apparent anomaly vanishes on considering the
experiments of M. Decourdemanche formerly noticed; which prove
that in animal fluids the sulphurets are rapidly changed into the oxide
(see p. <a href='#Page_225'>225</a>). The sulphurets, however, are much less active than
the preparations in which the metal exists already oxidated. Yet in
sufficient doses they will prove rapidly fatal. In the Acta Germanica
there is the case of a woman who was killed in a few hours by
realgar, mixed by her step-daughter in red cabbage soup.<a id='r581' /><a href='#f581' class='c013'><sup>[581]</sup></a> The
common artificial orpiment procured by sublimation is very active, in
consequence of the oxide mixed with it. Renault found three grains
killed a dog in nine hours.<a id='r582' /><a href='#f582' class='c013'><sup>[582]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Among the less active preparations of arsenic may also be enumerated
such of the arsenites and arseniates as are not soluble in water.
They have not indeed been actually tried. But there can be little
doubt that they will prove poisonous; because, though insoluble in
water, they are probably somewhat soluble in the animal juices. We
may infer from their sparing solubility, even in these menstrua, that
they will be less active than the preparations now to be mentioned,
which are more soluble.</p>

<p class='c006'>These are the alkaline arsenites and arseniates, arsenic acid, arsenious
acid, the black oxide or fly-powder, and arseniuretted-hydrogen.
With regard to arsenic acid, and the alkaline arseniates and arsenites,
it is probable, from their effects in medicinal doses, that they are as
active as the white oxide, if not more so. But they have not been
particularly examined, as they are not objects of great interest to the
medical jurist.</p>

<p class='c006'>The fly-powder or black oxide is very active. Renault found
that four grains killed a middle-sized dog in ten hours.<a id='r583' /><a href='#f583' class='c013'><sup>[583]</sup></a> It has been
likewise known to prove quickly fatal to man. In a French journal
there is a case related which ended fatally in sixteen hours;<a id='r584' /><a href='#f584' class='c013'><sup>[584]</sup></a> and in
the Acta Germanica is an account of four persons, who died in consequence
of eating a dish of stewed pears poisoned with it, and of
whom three died within eighteen hours.<a id='r585' /><a href='#f585' class='c013'><sup>[585]</sup></a> The dose is not mentioned;
but it is probable from the collateral circumstances that it
was not considerable.</p>

<p class='c006'>Arseniuretted-hydrogen is probably the most active of all arsenical
compounds. The celebrated German chemist Gehlen, having accidentally
inhaled a small portion of it, died in nine days with the
usual symptoms of arsenical poisoning. In Dr. O’Reilly’s case,
which proved fatal in seven days, it was computed that the equivalent
of twelve grains of oxide had been inhaled. And Dr. Schlinder’s
patient had inhaled a quantity of gas corresponding with only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>an eighth of a grain of sesquioxide; yet he appears to have made a
narrow escape.<a id='r586' /><a href='#f586' class='c013'><sup>[586]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It is of some consequence to settle with precision the power of the
white oxide. Witnesses are often asked on trials how small a quantity
will occasion death? It is obvious that this question admits
only of a vague answer: It can be answered at all only in reference
to concomitant circumstances, and even then but presumptively. Nevertheless,
it is right to be aware what facts are known on the subject.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been stated by various systematic authors that the white
oxide will prove fatal to man in the dose of two grains. Hahnemann
says in more special terms, that in circumstances favourable to its
action four grains may cause death within twenty-four hours, and
one or two grains in a few days.<a id='r587' /><a href='#f587' class='c013'><sup>[587]</sup></a> But neither he nor any of the
other authors alluded to have referred to actual cases. Foderé knew
half a grain cause colic pains in the stomach and dysenteric flux, which
continued obstinately for eight days;<a id='r588' /><a href='#f588' class='c013'><sup>[588]</sup></a> and I have related an instance
where six persons, after taking each a grain in wine during dinner,
were seriously and violently affected for twelve hours.<a id='r589' /><a href='#f589' class='c013'><sup>[589]</sup></a> Mr. Alfred
Taylor mentions three similar cases occasioned by arsenic accidentally
taken in port wine after dinner,—one, an infant of sixteen
months who got about a third of a grain, another, a lady
who took a grain and a half, and the third, a gentleman, who had
two grains and a half,—in all of whom violent vomiting, and
prostration, without pain, occurred for three or four hours; and the
gentleman of the party did not recover for several days.<a id='r590' /><a href='#f590' class='c013'><sup>[590]</sup></a> M.
Lachèse mentions his having met with a number of cases of poisoning
from small doses taken in bread or soup; whence he concludes,
that an eighth of a grain taken in food may cause vomiting;—that
a quarter of a grain or twice as much taken once only
causes vomiting, colic, and prostration,—that the same quantity repeated
next day renews these symptoms in such force as to render
the individual unfit for work till three or four days afterwards,—and
that four such doses, taken at intervals during two days, that
is between one and a half and two grains in all, excite acute gastro-enteritis
and may prove fatal, since two individuals who had
taken this much died, one in seven weeks, the other three weeks
later.<a id='r591' /><a href='#f591' class='c013'><sup>[591]</sup></a> The smallest fatal dose I have found recorded elsewhere
is four grains and a half; and death ensued in six hours only.<a id='r592' /><a href='#f592' class='c013'><sup>[592]</sup></a>
But the subject was a child, four years old, and the poison was taken
in solution. Alberti mentions the case of a man who died from
taking six grains; but I am unacquainted with the particulars, not
having seen the original account.<a id='r593' /><a href='#f593' class='c013'><sup>[593]</sup></a> Two children, whose cases are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>alluded to in the Proceedings of the Academy of Medicine of Paris,
died, the one in two days, the other a day later, after taking rather
less than sixteen grains. The former was four years and a half old,
the latter seven years.<a id='r594' /><a href='#f594' class='c013'><sup>[594]</sup></a> Valentini alludes to a case where thirty
grains of the oxide in powder killed an adult in six days.<a id='r595' /><a href='#f595' class='c013'><sup>[595]</sup></a> The
effects of medicinal doses, which seldom exceed a quarter of a grain
without causing irritation of the stomach, and the fatal effects of
somewhat larger doses on animals, Renault having found that a
single grain in solution killed a large dog in four hours,<a id='r596' /><a href='#f596' class='c013'><sup>[596]</sup></a> must
convince every one that the general statement of Hahnemann cannot
be very wide of the truth. Mr. Taylor thinks his own cases
mentioned above throw doubt over this inference. But it must
be remembered, that his patients had dined just before taking the
poison.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not improbable that the activity of oxide of arsenic is impaired
by admixture with other insoluble powders. M. Bertrand,
conceiving from some experiments on animals that he had found an
antidote for arsenic in charcoal powder, took no less than five grains
of the oxide mixed with that substance, and he did not suffer any
injury, although his stomach was empty at the time, and he did not
vomit.<a id='r597' /><a href='#f597' class='c013'><sup>[597]</sup></a> But Orfila afterwards showed, that other insoluble powders,
such as clay, have the same effect; that no such powder can be of
any use if not introduced into the stomach till after the arsenic is
swallowed; and that they appear to act solely by enveloping the
arsenical powder and preventing it from touching the membrane of
the alimentary canal.<a id='r598' /><a href='#f598' class='c013'><sup>[598]</sup></a> Although M. Bertrand’s discovery will not
supply the physician with an antidote, the medical jurist will not lose
sight of the interesting fact, that, by certain mechanical admixtures,
arsenic in moderate doses may be entirely deprived of its poisonous
quality. A singular case of recovery from no less a dose than sixty
grains, which happened in the case of an American physician, probably
comes under the same head with the experiments of Bertrand,—a
large quantity of powder of cinchona-bark having been swallowed
along with the arsenic. In this case, however, the symptoms
were severe for three days.<a id='r599' /><a href='#f599' class='c013'><sup>[599]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The tendency of habit to modify the action of arsenic is questionable.
So far as authentic facts go, habit has no power of familiarizing
the constitution to its use. One no doubt may hear now and then of
mountebanks who swallow without injury entire scruples or drachms
of arsenic, and vague accounts have reached me of patients who took
unusually large doses for medicinal purposes. But as to facts of the
former kind, it is clear that no importance can be attached to them;
for it is impossible to know how much of the feat is genuine, and how
much legerdemain. With respect to the latter facts, I have never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>been able to ascertain any precise instance of the kind; and so far
as my own experience goes, the habit of taking arsenic in medicinal
doses has quite an opposite effect from familiarizing the stomach
to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Oxide of arsenic being sparingly soluble, its operation is often
much influenced by the condition of the stomach as to food at the
time it is swallowed. If the stomach be empty, it adheres with
tenacity to the villous coat and acts with energy. If the stomach
be full at the time, the first portions that come in contact with
the inner membrane may cause vomiting before it can be diffused,
so that the whole or greater part is discharged. One remarkable
case of this nature has been quoted in page <a href='#Page_29'>29</a>. In another,
where severe symptoms did supervene, and recovery was ascribed
to the use of magnesia as an antidote, the favourable result seems to
have been really owing to the circumstance, that the patient had
supped heartily not long before taking the arsenic.<a id='r600' /><a href='#f600' class='c013'><sup>[600]</sup></a> An extraordinary
case related by Mr. Kerr, in which nearly three-quarters of an
ounce were retained for two hours without causing any serious mischief,
probably comes under the same category; for the arsenic was
taken immediately after a meal, and the stomach was cleared out by
emetics.<a id='r601' /><a href='#f601' class='c013'><sup>[601]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In the following detail of the symptoms caused by arsenic in man,
its effects when swallowed will be first noticed; and then some remarks
will be added on the phenomena observed when it is introduced
through other channels.</p>

<p class='c006'>The symptoms of poisoning with arsenic may be advantageously
considered under three heads. In one set of cases there are signs of
violent irritation of the alimentary canal and sometimes of the other
mucous membranes also, accompanied with excessive general depression,
but not with distinct disorder of the nervous system. When
such cases prove fatal, which they generally do, they terminate for
the most part in from twenty-four hours to three days. In a second
and very singular set of cases there is little sign of irritation in any
part of the alimentary canal; perhaps trivial vomiting or slight pain
in the stomach, but sometimes neither; the patient is chiefly or solely
affected with excessive prostration of strength and frequent fainting;
and death is seldom delayed beyond the fifth or sixth hour. In a
third set of cases life is commonly prolonged at least six days, sometimes
much longer, or recovery may even take place after a tedious
illness; and the signs of inflammation in the alimentary canal are
succeeded or become accompanied, about the second or fourth day
or later, by symptoms of irritation in the other mucous passages, and
more particularly by symptoms indicating a derangement of the
nervous system, such as palsy or epilepsy. The distinctions now laid
down will be found in practice to be well defined, and useful
for estimating in criminal cases the weight of the evidence from
symptoms.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. In one order of cases, then, arsenic produces symptoms of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>irritation or inflammation along the course of the alimentary canal.
Such cases are the most frequent of all. The person commonly
survives twenty-four hours, seldom more than three days; but instances
of the kind have sometimes proved fatal in a few hours, and
others have lasted for weeks. On the whole, however, if the case is
much shorter than twenty-four hours, or longer than three days, its
complexion is apt to be altered. In the mildest examples of the
present variety recovery takes place after a few attacks of vomiting,
and slight general indisposition for a day or two.</p>

<p class='c006'>In regard to the ordinary progress of the symptoms, the first of a
decisive character are sickness and faintness. It is generally thought
indeed that the first symptom is an acrid taste; but this notion has
been already shown to be erroneous. For some account of the sensations
felt in the act of swallowing the poison, the reader may refer to
what has been stated in p. <a href='#Page_200'>200</a>. There is no doubt, that in the way
in which arsenic is usually given with a criminal intent, namely,
mixed with articles of food, it seldom makes any impression at all
upon the senses during the act of swallowing.</p>

<p class='c006'>In some instances the sickness and faintness, particularly when the
poison was taken in solution, have begun a few minutes after it was
swallowed. Thus in a case mentioned by Bernt, in which a solution
of arseniate of potass was taken, the symptoms began violently in
fifteen minutes;<a id='r602' /><a href='#f602' class='c013'><sup>[602]</sup></a> in one related by Wildberg, where the oxide was
given in coffee, the person was affected immediately on taking the
second cup;<a id='r603' /><a href='#f603' class='c013'><sup>[603]</sup></a> in one related by Mr. Edwards, the patient was taken
ill in eight minutes,<a id='r604' /><a href='#f604' class='c013'><sup>[604]</sup></a> in one mentioned by M. Lachèse of Angers,
violent symptoms commenced within ten minutes after the poison
was swallowed with prunes;<a id='r605' /><a href='#f605' class='c013'><sup>[605]</sup></a> in a case communicated to me by Mr.
J. H. Stallard of Leicester, the symptoms set in with violence ten
minutes after it was taken dissolved in tea; nay, in a case of poisoning
with orpiment in soup, mentioned by Valentini, the man felt
unwell before he had finished his soup, and set it aside as disagreeable.<a id='r606' /><a href='#f606' class='c013'><sup>[606]</sup></a>
It is a mistake therefore to suppose, as I have known some do,
that arsenic never begins to operate for at least half an hour. Nevertheless
it must be admitted, that in general arsenic does not act for
half an hour after it is swallowed.—On the other hand, its operation
is seldom delayed beyond an hour. The following, however, are exceptions
to this rule. Lachèse in the paper quoted above mentions
an instance where the interval was two hours, and where the issue
was eventually fatal. The arsenic had been in very coarse powder.
Mr. Macaulay of Leicester has communicated to me a case where the
individual took the poison at eight in the evening, went to bed at
half-past nine, and slept till eleven, when he awoke with slight pain
in the stomach, vomiting, and cold sweats. In this instance the dose
was seven drachms, and death took place in nine hours. M. Devergie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>has related a similar case of poisoning with the sulphuret, where
the symptoms did not begin for three hours; and here too the patient
fell asleep immediately after swallowing the poison.<a id='r607' /><a href='#f607' class='c013'><sup>[607]</sup></a> Professor
Orfila has noticed an instance, to be quoted afterwards, where there appears
to have been scarcely any symptom at all for five hours<a id='r608' /><a href='#f608' class='c013'><sup>[608]</sup></a> (p. <a href='#Page_243'>243</a>).
I suspect we must also consider as an instance of the same kind the
case which gave occasion to the trial of Mrs. Smith here in 1827. A
white draught was administered in a suspicious manner at ten in the
evening; the girl immediately went to bed; and no symptoms appeared
till six next morning, from which time her illness went on
uninterruptedly.<a id='r609' /><a href='#f609' class='c013'><sup>[609]</sup></a> In three of the preceding cases it will be remarked
that sleep intervened between the taking of the poison and the invasion
of the symptoms; and it is therefore not improbable that the
reason of the retardation is the comparative inactivity of the animal
system during sleep.—In voluntary poisoning, as in a case related
by Dr. Roget, a slight attack of sickness or vomiting occasionally
ensues immediately after solid arsenic is swallowed, and some time
before the symptoms commence regularly.<a id='r610' /><a href='#f610' class='c013'><sup>[610]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The observations now made will often prove important for deciding
accusations of poisoning; for pointed evidence may be derived
from the commencement of the symptoms, after a suspected meal,
corresponding or not corresponding with the interval which is known
to elapse in ascertained cases. The reader will see the effect of such
evidence in attaching guilt to the prisoner in the case of Margaret
Wishart, which I have detailed elsewhere.<a id='r611' /><a href='#f611' class='c013'><sup>[611]</sup></a> In the trial of Mrs.
Smith, the want of the correspondence just mentioned contributed
greatly to her acquittal; for the symptoms of poisoning did not begin
till more than eight hours after the only occasion on which the prisoner
was proved to have administered any thing in a suspicious manner.
As I was not at the time acquainted with any parallel case except that
recorded by Orfila, I hesitated to ascribe the symptoms to the draught;
and consequently, as the other medical witnesses felt the same hesitation
on the same account, the proof of administration was considered
to have failed. I am not sure that I should have now felt the
same difficulty. The intervening state of sleep probably affords an
explanation of the long interval; and the cases noticed by Mr.
Macaulay and M. Devergie are parallel, though the interval in them
was certainly not so great.—There is a limit, however, to the possible
interval in such cases. It seems impossible that the action of the
poison shall be suspended for three entire days. Yet death has been
ascribed to arsenic in such circumstances. A child 3½ years old
having swallowed eight grains with bread and butter, but being soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>made to vomit forcibly by emetics, presented no decided symptom at
the time, or for three days more; but on the fourth day difficult
breathing ensued, with anxiety of expression, frequency of the pulse,
and heat of the skin; and next day death took place. There was no
morbid appearance found in the body.<a id='r612' /><a href='#f612' class='c013'><sup>[612]</sup></a> I do not know of any
parallel instance of death from arsenic, and cannot admit that the
poison was the cause of the symptoms and fatal event.</p>

<p class='c006'>Soon after the sickness begins, or about the same time, the region
of the stomach feels painful, the pain being commonly of a burning
kind, and much aggravated by pressure. Violent fits of vomiting and
retching then speedily ensue, especially when drink is taken. There
is often also a sense of dryness, heat, and tightness in the throat,
creating an incessant desire for drink; and this affection often precedes
the vomiting. Occasionally it is wanting, at other times so severe
as to be attended with suffocation and convulsive vomiting at the
sight of fluids.<a id='r613' /><a href='#f613' class='c013'><sup>[613]</sup></a> Hoarseness and difficulty of speech are commonly
combined with it. The matter vomited is greenish or yellowish;
but sometimes streaked or mixed with blood, particularly when the
case lasts longer than a day.</p>

<p class='c006'>In no long time after the first illness diarrhœa generally makes its
appearance, but not always. In some cases, instead of it, the patient
is tormented by frequent, ineffectual calls: in others the great intestines
are scarcely affected. About this time the pain in the stomach is
excruciating, and is often likened by the sufferer to a fire burning
within him. It likewise extends more or less downwards, particularly
when the diarrhœa or tenesmus is severe; and the belly is commonly
tense and tender, sometimes also swollen, though not frequently,—sometimes
even on the contrary drawn in at the navel.<a id='r614' /><a href='#f614' class='c013'><sup>[614]</sup></a> When the
diarrhœa is severe, the anus is commonly excoriated and affected
with burning pain.<a id='r615' /><a href='#f615' class='c013'><sup>[615]</sup></a> In such cases the burning pain may extend
along the whole course of the alimentary canal from the throat to the
anus. Nay at times the mouth and lips are also inflamed, presenting
dark specks or blisters.<a id='r616' /><a href='#f616' class='c013'><sup>[616]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Sometimes there are likewise present signs of irritation of the lungs
and air-passages,—almost always shortness of breath (which, however,
is chiefly owing to the tenderness of the belly),—often a sense
of tightness across the bottom of the chest, and more rarely decided
pain in the same quarter, darting also through the upper part of the
chest. Sometimes pneumonia has appeared a prominent affection
during life, and been distinctly traced in the dead body.<a id='r617' /><a href='#f617' class='c013'><sup>[617]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In many instances, too, the urinary passages are affected, the patient
being harassed with frequent, painful and difficult micturition, swelling
of the penis, and pain in the region of the bladder, or, if a female,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>with burning pain of the vagina and excoriation of the labia.<a id='r618' /><a href='#f618' class='c013'><sup>[618]</sup></a> Sometimes
the irritation of the urinary organs is so great as to be attended
with total suppression of urine, as in a case related by Guilbert of
Montpellier, in which this symptom continued several days.<a id='r619' /><a href='#f619' class='c013'><sup>[619]</sup></a> During
the late contentions among chemists, physiologists, and physicians,
occasioned by the case of Madame Lafarge, it was alleged by Flandin
and Danger that in animals the urine is always suppressed, by Orfila
that it is always secreted, by Professor Delafond of the Alfort Veterinary
School, that it is never suppressed, but always diminished, and
sometimes even to a sixth of the natural quantity.<a id='r620' /><a href='#f620' class='c013'><sup>[620]</sup></a> There is, however,
no invariable rule in the matter. And in fact, urinary symptoms
are seldom present unless the lower bowels are likewise strongly
irritated; but are then seldom altogether wanting. They are rarely
well marked in cases of the present variety, unless life is prolonged
three days or more.</p>

<p class='c006'>When symptoms of irritation of the alimentary canal have subsisted
a few hours, convulsive motions often occur. They commence on
the trunk, afterwards extend over the whole body, are seldom violent,
and generally consist of nothing else than tremors and twitches.
Cramps of the legs and arms, a possible concomitant of every kind
of diarrhœa, is peculiarly severe and frequent in that caused by
arsenic.</p>

<p class='c006'>The general system always sympathizes acutely with the local
derangement. The pulse commonly becomes very small, feeble and
rapid soon after the vomiting sets in; and in no long time it is often
imperceptible. This state is naturally attended with great coldness,
clammy sweats, and lividity of the feet and hands. Another symptom
referrible to the circulation which has been observed, though,
very rarely, is palpitation.<a id='r621' /><a href='#f621' class='c013'><sup>[621]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The countenance is commonly collapsed from an early period, and
almost always expressive of great torture and extreme anxiety or
despair; the eyes are red and sparkling; the conjunctiva often so injected
as to seem inflamed; the tongue and mouth parched; and the
velum and palate sometimes covered with little white ulcers.</p>

<p class='c006'>Delirium sometimes accompanies the advanced stage, and stupor
also is not unfrequent. Coma occasionally precedes death, as in Mr.
Stallard’s case (p. <a href='#Page_235'>235</a>), in which the symptoms of irritation, at first
very violent, gradually gave place in two hours to complete insensibility,
proving fatal in two hours more. Very often, however, the
patient remains quite sensible to the last. Death in general comes
on calmly, but is sometimes preceded by a paroxysm of convulsions.<a id='r622' /><a href='#f622' class='c013'><sup>[622]</sup></a>
In some cases it takes place quite unexpectedly, as if from sudden
deliquium, as in a case mentioned by Dr. Dymock of this city. The
patient, a girl who had taken two ounces intentionally, rose from her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>bed without help two hours and a half afterwards, went to a chair at
the fireside, and had scarce sat down when she expired.<a id='r623' /><a href='#f623' class='c013'><sup>[623]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Various eruptions have at times been observed, especially in those
who survive several days; but they are more frequent in the kind of
cases to be considered afterwards, in which life is prolonged for a
week or more. The eruptions have been variously described as resembling
petechiæ, or measles, or red miliaria, or small-pox. In
the case already quoted from Guilbert a copious eruption of miliary
vesicles appeared on the fifth day, and for fifteen days afterwards.
They were attended with perspiration and abatement of the other
symptoms, and followed with desquamation of the cuticle. Another
external affection which may be noticed is general swelling of the body.
Several cases of this nature have been described by Dr. Schlegel of
Meiningen; and in one of them the swelling, particularly round the
eyes, appears to have been considerable.<a id='r624' /><a href='#f624' class='c013'><sup>[624]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In some cases of the kind now under consideration a short remission
or even a total intermission of all the distressing symptoms has been
witnessed, particularly when death is retarded till the close of the
second or third day.<a id='r625' /><a href='#f625' class='c013'><sup>[625]</sup></a> This remission, which is accompanied with
dozing stupor, is most generally observed about the beginning of the
second day. It is merely temporary, the symptoms speedily returning
with equal or increased violence. Sometimes the remission
occurs oftener than once, as in a case related in the London Medical
and Physical Journal. The patient, a child seven years old, lived
thirty-six hours in a state of alternate calm and excitement; and
during the state of calm no pulse was to be felt at the wrists.<a id='r626' /><a href='#f626' class='c013'><sup>[626]</sup></a>—So
far as at present appears a long intermission is impossible.</p>

<p class='c006'>In cases such as those now described death often occurs about
twenty-four hours after the poison is swallowed, and generally before
the close of the third day. But on the one hand life has been sometimes
prolonged, without the supervention of the symptoms belonging
to a different variety of cases, for five or six days,<a id='r627' /><a href='#f627' class='c013'><sup>[627]</sup></a> nay perhaps even
for several weeks. And, on the other hand, the symptoms of irritation
of the alimentary canal are sometimes distinct, although death
takes place in a much shorter period than twenty-four hours. Metzger
has related a striking case, fatal in six hours, in which the symptoms
were acute colic pain, violent vomiting, and profuse diarrhœa;<a id='r628' /><a href='#f628' class='c013'><sup>[628]</sup></a> and
Wildberg has related a similar case fatal in the same time.<a id='r629' /><a href='#f629' class='c013'><sup>[629]</sup></a> Hohnbaum
describes another fatal in five hours;<a id='r630' /><a href='#f630' class='c013'><sup>[630]</sup></a> and I met with as brief
a case in this city in 1843, where all the usual symptoms of irritation
in the stomach and bowels were violent. These symptoms were also
present at first in Mr. Stallard’s case, which was fatal in four hours;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>Pyl has recorded one, where all the signs of irritation in the stomach
and intestines were present, except vomiting, and which proved fatal
in three hours;<a id='r631' /><a href='#f631' class='c013'><sup>[631]</sup></a> and Dr. Dymock met here with a similar instance
which lasted only two hours and a half.<a id='r632' /><a href='#f632' class='c013'><sup>[632]</sup></a> This is one of the shortest
undoubted cases of poisoning from arsenic I have hitherto found in
authentic records. Dr. Male mentions one, which was fatal in four
hours;<a id='r633' /><a href='#f633' class='c013'><sup>[633]</sup></a> Wepfer another equally short;<a id='r634' /><a href='#f634' class='c013'><sup>[634]</sup></a> Johnston another fatal in
three hours and a half;<a id='r635' /><a href='#f635' class='c013'><sup>[635]</sup></a> and I shall presently mention others without
symptoms of irritation which ended fatally in two, five, or six hours
[p. <a href='#Page_242'>242</a>].<a id='r636' /><a href='#f636' class='c013'><sup>[636]</sup></a> Wibmer has even quoted a case fatal in half an hour;
but there seems to have been some doubt whether the poison taken
was arsenic.<a id='r637' /><a href='#f637' class='c013'><sup>[637]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Such is an account of the symptoms of poisoning by arsenic in
their most frequent form. It will of course be understood, that they
are liable to a great variety as to violence, as well as their mode of
combination in actual cases;—and that they are by no means all
present in every instance. The most remarkable and least variable
of them all, pain and vomiting, are sometimes wanting. A case, in
which pain was not felt in the stomach, even on pressure, although
the other symptoms of inflammation were present, has been briefly
described in the Medical Repository.<a id='r638' /><a href='#f638' class='c013'><sup>[638]</sup></a> A similar case fatal in fourteen
hours and a half, where there was much vomiting and some
heat in the stomach, but no pain or tenderness, has been related by
Dr. E. Gairdner.<a id='r639' /><a href='#f639' class='c013'><sup>[639]</sup></a> Another very striking example of this anomalous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>deficiency has been detailed by Dr. Yellowly. A lad sixteen years
old died twenty-one hours after swallowing half an ounce of the white
oxide; and the presence of inflammation was denoted all along by
sickness, vomiting, purging, and heat in the tongue; yet he never
complained of pain, neither did he ever seem to his friends to suffer
any. Another anomaly in the case was, that the pulse, contrary
to what is usual, was very slow: twelve hours after he took the
poison, the pulse was 40, and two hours before death it was so slow
as 30.<a id='r640' /><a href='#f640' class='c013'><sup>[640]</sup></a> These deviations from the ordinary course of the symptoms
are taken notice of merely to put the practitioner on his guard, and
prevent the medical jurist from drawing hasty conclusions. Upon
the whole, they are rare; and the symptoms of poisoning by arsenic
are in general very uniform.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The second variety of poisoning with arsenic includes a few
cases in which the signs of inflammation are far from violent or even
altogether wanting, and in which death ensues in five or six hours or
a little more,—at a period too early for inflammation to be always
properly developed. The symptoms are then generally obscure, and
are referrible chiefly to the mode of action, which is probably the
cause of death in most cases,—a powerful debilitating influence on
the circulation, or on the nervous system.</p>

<p class='c006'>These symptoms occasionally amount to absolute narcotism, as in
some of the animals on which Sir B. Brodie experimented. Thus,
when he injected a solution of the oxide into the stomach of a dog,
the pulse was rendered slow and intermitting; the animal became
palsied in the hind-legs, lethargic, and in no long time insensible, with
dilated pupils; and soon afterwards it was seized with convulsions,
amidst which it died, fifty minutes after the poison was administered.<a id='r641' /><a href='#f641' class='c013'><sup>[641]</sup></a>
In man the symptoms very seldom resembled so closely those of the
narcotic poisons. In Mr. Stallard’s case, however, formerly mentioned,
the symptoms of irritation which appeared at first speedily
gave place to complete insensibility for two hours before death (pp.
<a href='#Page_235'>235</a>, 238), a similar instance has been related in Henke’s Journal.
A young man who got an arsenical solution from an old woman to
cure ague, was attacked after taking it with vomiting and loud cries,
afterwards with incoherent talking, then fell into a deep sleep, and
finally perished in convulsions in five hours.<a id='r642' /><a href='#f642' class='c013'><sup>[642]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In some cases of the kind now under consideration, one or two
attacks of vomiting occur at the usual interval after the taking of
the poison; but it seldom continues. The most uniform and remarkable
affection is extreme faintness, amounting at times to deliquium.
Occasionally there is some stupor, or rather oppression, and
often slight convulsions. Pain in the stomach is generally present;
but it is slight, and seldom accompanied with other signs of internal
inflammation. Death commonly takes place in a few hours. Yet,
even when it is retarded till the beginning of the second day, the
faintness and stupor are sometimes more striking features in the case
than the symptoms of inflammation in the stomach.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>This variety of poisoning has been hitherto observed only under
the three following circumstances,—when the dose of poison was
large,—when it was in little masses,—or when it was in a state of
solution. The mode in which the first and last circumstances operate
is evident; they facilitate the absorption of a large quantity of arsenic
in a short space of time, so that its remote action begins before local
inflammation is fully developed. But it is not easy to see how any
such effect can flow from the arsenic being in little masses. It is
also to be observed that none of the circumstances here mentioned is
invariable in its operation. An instance is related in Rust’s Magazine,
of the customary signs of irritation having been produced even
by the solution.<a id='r643' /><a href='#f643' class='c013'><sup>[643]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>On the whole, the present variety of poisoning is rather uncommon,
and indeed, although the attention of the profession was pointedly
called to it even in the first edition of the present work, its existence
does not seem to be so generally known as it ought to be.<a id='r644' /><a href='#f644' class='c013'><sup>[644]</sup></a> It may
be right therefore to specify the cases which have been published.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the Medical and Philosophical Journal of New York,<a id='r645' /><a href='#f645' class='c013'><sup>[645]</sup></a> is related
the case of a druggist, who swallowed an ounce of powdered arsenic
at once, and died in eight hours, after two or three fits of vomiting,
with slight pain and heat in the stomach.—A similar case has been
related by Metzger. A young woman died in a few hours, after suffering
from trivial diarrhœa, pain in the stomach and strangury; her
death was immediately preceded by slight convulsions and fits of suffocation;
and on dissection the stomach and intestines were found
quite healthy. Half an ounce of arsenic was found in the stomach.<a id='r646' /><a href='#f646' class='c013'><sup>[646]</sup></a>—A
third case similar in its particulars to the two preceding was
submitted to me for investigation by the sheriff of this county in 1825.
The subject, a girl fourteen years of age, took about ninety grains,
and died in five hours, having vomited once or twice, complained of
some little pain in the belly, and been affected towards the close with
great faintness and weakness. The stomach and intestines were
healthy.<a id='r647' /><a href='#f647' class='c013'><sup>[647]</sup></a>—A fourth case allied to these is succinctly told in the
Medical and Physical Journal. The person expired in five hours;
and vomiting never occurred, even though emetics were given.<a id='r648' /><a href='#f648' class='c013'><sup>[648]</sup></a>—A
fifth has been related by M. Gérard of Beauvais. The subject was
a man so addicted to drinking, that his daily allowance was a pint of
brandy. When first seen, there was so much tranquillity, that doubts
were entertained whether arsenic had really been swallowed; but at
length he was discovered actually chewing it. This state continued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>for nearly five hours, when some vomiting ensued: coldness of the
extremities and spasmodic flexion of the legs soon followed; and in
a few minutes more he expired.<a id='r649' /><a href='#f649' class='c013'><sup>[649]</sup></a>—A sixth and very singular case
of the same kind has been described by Orfila. The individual
having swallowed three drachms at eight in the morning, went about
for two hours bidding adieu to his friends and telling what he had
done. He was then prevailed on to take emetics and diluents, which
caused free, easy vomiting. He suffered very little till one, when
he became affected with constricting pain and burning in the stomach,
feeble pulse, cold sweats, and cadaverous expression, under which
symptoms he died four hours later.<a id='r650' /><a href='#f650' class='c013'><sup>[650]</sup></a> Orfila justly designates this case
as the most extraordinary instance of poisoning with arsenic that has
come under his notice.—A seventh is related by Mr. Holland of
Manchester where death took place in the course of eight or nine
hours, and the symptoms were at first some vomiting, afterwards
little else but faintness, sickness, a sullen expression, and a general
appearance which led those around to suppose the individual intoxicated.<a id='r651' /><a href='#f651' class='c013'><sup>[651]</sup></a>—Professor
Chaussier has described a still more striking case
than any yet mentioned. A stout middle-aged man swallowed a
large quantity of arsenic in fragments and died in a few hours. He
experienced nothing but great feebleness and frequent tendency to
fainting. The stomach and intestines were not in the slightest degree
affected during life; and no morbid appearance could be discovered
in them after death,<a id='r652' /><a href='#f652' class='c013'><sup>[652]</sup></a>—A similar instance not less remarkable
has been communicated to me by Mr. Macauley of Leicester,
where the individual died with narcotic symptoms only within two
hours after taking nearly a quarter of a pound of arsenic.—Another
fatal in four hours has been described by Mr. Wright, where the
symptoms were vomiting under the use of emetics, great exhaustion,
feeble hurried pulse, cold sweating, drowsiness and finally stupor.
In this case the quantity of arsenic taken was about an ounce.<a id='r653' /><a href='#f653' class='c013'><sup>[653]</sup></a>—Another
of the same nature is recorded by Morgagni. An old woman
stole and ate a cake, which had been poisoned with arsenic for rats.
She died in twelve hours, suffering, says Morgagni, rather from excessive
prostration of strength than from pain or convulsions.<a id='r654' /><a href='#f654' class='c013'><sup>[654]</sup></a>—The
following case related by M. Laborde is most remarkable in its circumstances.
A young woman was caught in the act of swallowing
little fragments of arsenic, and it afterwards appeared that she had
been employed most of the day in literally cracking and chewing
lumps of it. When the physician first saw her the countenance expressed
chagrin and melancholy, but not suffering. After being
forced to drink she vomited a good deal, but without uneasiness.
Two hours afterwards her countenance was anxious; but she did not
make any complaint, and very soon resumed her tranquillity. Five
hours after the last portions of the poison were taken she became
drowsy, then remained perfectly calm for four hours more, and at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>length on trying to sit up in bed, complained of slight pain in the
stomach, and expired without agony. A clot of blood was found in
the stomach.<a id='r655' /><a href='#f655' class='c013'><sup>[655]</sup></a>—Dr. Platner of Pavia describes a case, fatal probably
in five hours, where the symptoms were a tranquil, melancholic
expression, great coldness, paleness of the features, slow languid
pulse, retarded respiration, and suppression of urine, but no pain or
swelling of the belly, and no diarrhœa till near death, when there
was one copious fluid evacuation.<a id='r656' /><a href='#f656' class='c013'><sup>[656]</sup></a>—Lastly, Dr. Choulant has related
the case of an elderly female who got a thimbleful of arsenic
in soup, and died in eleven hours, affected with occasional, easy
vomiting, uneasiness, thirst, and undefinable uneasiness in the chest,
but without pain of any kind, or any other complaint.<a id='r657' /><a href='#f657' class='c013'><sup>[657]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The cases of which an abstract has here been given, will, it is apprehended,
be sufficient to correct the erroneous impression of many,—that
arsenic, when it proves fatal, always produces violent and
well-marked symptoms. It will of course be understood that cases
of the present kind pass by insensible shades into those of the first
class,—the following, for example, being intermediate between the
two. A young man had frequent vomiting and diarrhœa, which
were supposed to depend on indigestion merely, as the countenance
was calm, without any appearance of suffering, the appetite tolerable,
and the abdomen quite free of tenderness. The pulse, however,
quickly sunk, the voice failed, and death took place in eleven hours;
and on dissection about twenty grains of arsenic were found in the
stomach with strong signs of inflammation.<a id='r658' /><a href='#f658' class='c013'><sup>[658]</sup></a>—In a case communicated
to me by a former pupil, Mr. Adams of Glasgow, that of a woman
who died five hours after taking six drachms of arsenic, there was
some vomiting not long after she swallowed it; but subsequently
she presented no prominent symptoms except a ghastly expression,
redness of the eyes, a fluttering pulse and extreme prostration, until
within half an hour before death, when the action of an emetic and
the stomach-pump was followed by severe burning pain.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The third variety of poisoning with arsenic places in a clear
point of view its occasional action on the nervous system. This
occurs chiefly in persons who, from having taken but a small quantity,
or from having vomited soon after, are eventually rescued from destruction;
but it has also been met with in some cases where death
ensued after a protracted illness.</p>

<p class='c006'>In such cases the progress of the poisoning may be divided into
two stages. The first train of symptoms is exactly that of the first or
inflammatory variety, and is commonly developed in a very perfect
and violent form. In the second stage the symptoms are referrible
to nervous irritation.</p>

<p class='c006'>These generally come on when the former begin to recede; yet
sometimes they make their appearance earlier, while the signs of inflammation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>in the alimentary canal continue violent; and more rarely
both classes of symptoms begin about the same period. The
nervous affection varies in different individuals. The most formidable
is coma; the slightest, a peculiar, imperfect palsy of the arms or
legs, resembling what is occasioned by the poison of lead; and
between these extremes have been observed epileptic fits, or tetanus,
or an affection resembling hysteria, or mania. As these affections
are of much interest, in respect to the evidence of poisoning from
symptoms, it may be well to relate in abstract a few characteristic
examples of each.</p>

<p class='c006'>A good example of epilepsy supervening on the ordinary symptoms
of inflammation has been minutely related by Dr. Roget. A girl
swallowed a drachm of arsenic, and was in consequence attacked
violently with the usual symptoms of irritation in the whole alimentary
canal. After being ill about twenty-four hours, she experienced
several distinct remissions and had some repose, attended with fainting.
In twelve hours more she began to improve rapidly; the pain
subsided, her strength and spirits returned, and the stomach became
capable of retaining liquids. So far this patient laboured under the
common effects of arsenic. But a new train of symptoms then gradually
approached. Towards the close of the second day she was
harassed with frightful dreams, starting from sleep, and tendency to
faint; next morning with coldness along the spine, giddiness, and
intolerance of light; and on the fourth day with aching of the extremities
and tingling of the whole skin. These symptoms continued
till the close of the sixth day, when she was suddenly seized with
convulsions of the left side, foaming at the mouth, and total insensibility.
The convulsions endured two hours, the insensibility throughout
the whole night. Next evening she had another and a similar
fit. A third, but slighter fit occurred on the morning of the tenth;
another next day at noon; and they continued to return occasionally
till the nineteenth day. For some time longer she was affected with
tightness across the chest and stomach complaints; but she was
eventually restored to perfect health.<a id='r659' /><a href='#f659' class='c013'><sup>[659]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>A characteristic set of similar cases, which occurred in London in
1815, has been related in a treatise on arsenic by Mr. Marshall.<a id='r660' /><a href='#f660' class='c013'><sup>[660]</sup></a>
They were the subject of investigation on the trial of Eliza Fenning,
a maid-servant, who attempted to poison the whole of her master’s
family by mixing arsenic with a dumpling, and whose condemnation
excited an extraordinary sensation at the time, as many persons believed
her to be innocent. Five individuals partook of the poisoned
dish, and they were all violently seized with the usual inflammatory
symptoms. But farther, one had an epileptic fit on the first day,
which returned on the second, and he had besides frequent twitches
of the muscles of the trunk, a feeling of numbness in one side, and
heat and tingling of the feet and hands. Another had tremors of the
right arm and leg on the first day, and several epileptic fits in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>course of the night. During the next fifteen days he had a paroxysm
every evening about the same hour; which returned after
an intermission of eight days, and frequently for several months afterwards.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the following set of cases the nervous symptoms exhibited a
singular combination of delirium, convulsions, tetanus, and coma,
such as is frequently met with in paroxysms of hysteria; but the
cases are probably not pure examples of poisoning with arsenic, for
liver of sulphur was administered as a remedy to a considerable
amount. Three servant girls in one of the Hebrides ate a mixture
of lard, sugar, and arsenic, which had been laid for destroying rats.
The ordinary signs of irritation in the stomach ensued, but on the
following morning were greatly mitigated. They were then ordered
twelve grains of liver of sulphur every other hour. Soon afterwards
the inflammatory symptoms became more severe, the root of the
tongue swelled and inflamed, and in the afternoon two of them lost
the power of speech and swallowing, and were attacked with locked-jaw
and general convulsions. The third had not locked-jaw, but
was otherwise similarly, affected. On the morning of the third day
one of the two former was found comatose, with continuance of the
locked-jaw and occasional return of convulsions; and on being roused
by venesection and the cold affusion, she complained of headache and
heat in the throat. The sulphuret of potass, which had been discontinued
on account of the locked-jaw, was then resumed. On the
evening of the fourth day the headache increased, and the patient
became delirious and unmanageable. The cold affusion, however,
soon restored her again to her senses, and from that time her recovery
was progressive. In the other patients the symptoms were similar,
but less violent. In these instances the evidence of an injury of the
nervous system was decisive; but it may be doubted whether the
symptoms were not, in part at least, owing to the sulphuret of
potass, which has been already described as an active poison, capable
of inducing convulsions and tetanus. Its properties were not
generally known in this country at the time the cases in question
happened.<a id='r661' /><a href='#f661' class='c013'><sup>[661]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Sometimes the convulsions caused by arsenic assume the form of
pure tetanus. At least a case of this affection is noticed by Portal.<a id='r662' /><a href='#f662' class='c013'><sup>[662]</sup></a>
He has given only a mere announcement of it; and I have not hitherto
met with a parallel instance in authors.</p>

<p class='c006'>A common nervous affection in the advanced stage of the more
tedious cases of poisoning with arsenic is partial palsy. Palsy in the
form of incomplete paraplegia is a very common symptom even of
the early stage in animals, and has been also sometimes observed
during that stage in man. The paralytic affection, however, is more
frequent in the advanced stage; and in those persons who recover, an
incomplete paralysis of one or more of the extremities, resembling
lead palsy, is often the last symptom which continues.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Dehaen relates a distinct example of this disorder occurring in a
female who took a small quantity of arsenic by mistake. The ordinary
signs of inflammation were soon subdued, and for three days
she did well; but on the fourth she was attacked with cramps, tenderness,
and weakness of the feet, legs and arms, increasing gradually
till the whole extremities became at length almost completely
palsied. At the same time the cuticle desquamated. But the other
functions continued entire. The power of motion returned first
in the hands, then in the arms, and she eventually recovered; but
eleven months passed before she could quit the hospital where Dehaen
treated her.<a id='r663' /><a href='#f663' class='c013'><sup>[663]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>An excellent account of a set of similar cases has been given by
Dr. Murray of Aberdeen. They became the subject of judicial inquiry
on the trial of George Thom, who was condemned in 1821 at
the Aberdeen autumn circuit for poisoning his brother-in-law. Four
persons were simultaneously affected about an hour after breakfast
with the primary symptoms of poisoning with arsenic, and some in
a very violent degree. But besides these symptoms, in all of them
the muscular debility was great; and in two it amounted to true
partial palsy. One of them lost altogether the power of the left arm,
and six months after, when the account of the cases was published,
he was unable to bend the arm at the elbow-joint. The other had
also great general debility and long-continued numbness and pains
of the legs.<a id='r664' /><a href='#f664' class='c013'><sup>[664]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>An interesting case of the same nature with these was lately submitted
to me on the part of the crown. A man after taking arsenic
was attacked with vomiting, purging, and other symptoms of abdominal
irritation, which were mistaken for dysentery. Five days
afterwards he began to suffer also from feebleness of the limbs;
amounting almost to palsy. Subsequently an improvement slowly
took place; but he continued to suffer under irritative fever, diarrhœa,
and faintness. Several weeks later the diarrhœa abated, but he had
great stiffness, numbness, and loss of power in the joints of the hands
and feet. Two months after he first took ill, and while he was slowly
recovering from this paralytic affection, arsenic was again administered
and proved fatal in eighteen hours.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another, somewhat similar to the preceding, has been related by
M. Lachèse of Angers. Two people took about half a grain in soup
twice a day for two days, and were attacked with the usual primary
symptoms. One of them died in ten weeks, gradually worn out,
but without any particular nervous affection. The other was seized
with convulsions, and afterwards with almost complete palsy of the
limbs.<a id='r665' /><a href='#f665' class='c013'><sup>[665]</sup></a>—A well-marked case of the same nature has been noticed
by Professor Bernt. It was the case formerly alluded to as arising
from an over-dose of the arseniate of potass. The paralytic affection
consisted in the loss of sensation and of the power of motion in the
hands, and of the loss of motion in the feet, with contraction of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>knee-joints. The issue of the case is not mentioned.<a id='r666' /><a href='#f666' class='c013'><sup>[666]</sup></a>—Dr. Falconer
observes in his essay on Palsy, that he had repeatedly witnessed
local palsy after poisoning with arsenic, and alludes to one
instance in which the hands only were paralysed, and to two others
in which the palsy spread gradually from the fingers upwards till the
whole arms were affected.<a id='r667' /><a href='#f667' class='c013'><sup>[667]</sup></a>—On the whole, then, local palsy is the
most frequent of the secondary effects of arsenic.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is sometimes very obstinate, as the cases related by Dehaen and
Murray will show. But it even appears to be sometimes incurable.
For in the German Ephemerides there is related the case of a cook,
who after suffering from the usual inflammatory symptoms, was attacked
with perfect palsy of the limbs, and had not any use of them
during the rest of her life, which was not a short one.<a id='r668' /><a href='#f668' class='c013'><sup>[668]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Occasionally, instead of being palsied, the limbs are rigidly bent
and cannot be extended.<a id='r669' /><a href='#f669' class='c013'><sup>[669]</sup></a> They were contracted, as well as palsied
in the case noticed by Bernt.</p>

<p class='c006'>The last nervous affection to be mentioned is mania. The only instance
I have hitherto found of that disease arising from arsenic is
related by Amatus Lusitanus. He has not recorded the particulars
of the case, but merely observes that the individual became so outrageously
mad as to burst his fetters and jump out of the window of
his apartment.<a id='r670' /><a href='#f670' class='c013'><sup>[670]</sup></a> According to Zacchias, Amatus was not very scrupulous
in his adherence to fact in recording cases.</p>

<p class='c006'>The preceding remarks contain all that is known with certainty of
the effect of arsenic on man when it is swallowed. Independently of
the obvious nervous disorders which succeed the acute symptoms,
other morbid affections of a more obscure character and chronic in
their nature have been sometimes observed or supposed to arise from
this poison.—Among these the most unequivocal is dyspepsia. Irritability
of the stomach, attended with constant vomiting of food, has
been occasionally noticed for a long time after. Wepfer has described
two cases in which the primary symptoms were followed, in one by
dyspepsia of three years’ standing, in the other by emaciation and an
anomalous fever, which ended fatally in three years.<a id='r671' /><a href='#f671' class='c013'><sup>[671]</sup></a>—Hahnemann
farther adds, that in the advanced stage the hair sometimes drops
out, and the cuticle desquamates, accompanied occasionally with
great tenderness of the skin;<a id='r672' /><a href='#f672' class='c013'><sup>[672]</sup></a> and Wibmer mentions a case of the
kind, where not the cuticle and hair only, but likewise even the
nails, fell off.<a id='r673' /><a href='#f673' class='c013'><sup>[673]</sup></a> Desquamation of the cuticle and dropping of the
nails are at times produced by the continued use of arsenic in medicinal
doses.—Other effects have likewise been ascribed to its employment
medicinally. Thus passing over what was stated by its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>opponents at the time when its introduction into the materia medica
was made the subject of controversy over Europe, Broussais maintained
that it causes chronic inflammation of the stomach or intestines;<a id='r674' /><a href='#f674' class='c013'><sup>[674]</sup></a>
and Dr. Astbury inferred, from an instance which fell under his notice,
that it may bring on dropsy.<a id='r675' /><a href='#f675' class='c013'><sup>[675]</sup></a> Neither of these ideas is supported by
the general experience of the profession; and although some persons
even of late have alleged that those, who take it medicinally to any
material amount, invariably die soon after of some chronic disease,<a id='r676' /><a href='#f676' class='c013'><sup>[676]</sup></a>
there cannot be a doubt, that, under proper restriction, it is both an
effectual and a safe remedy.—A case where salivation, with fetor
and superficial ulceration of the gums, seemed to have been produced
by arsenic, was lately published in an English Journal.<a id='r677' /><a href='#f677' class='c013'><sup>[677]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In the present place may also be considered the supposed effects
of the celebrated <i>Aqua Toffana</i> or <i>Acquetta di Napoli</i>, a slow poison,
which in the sixteenth century, was believed to possess the property
of causing death at any determinate period, after months for example,
or even years, of ill health, according to the will of the poisoner.</p>

<p class='c006'>The most authentic description of the aqua Toffana ascribes its
properties to arsenic. According to a letter addressed to Hoffman
by Garelli, physician to Charles the Sixth of Austria, that Emperor
told Garelli, that, being governor of Naples at the time the aqua
Toffana was the dread of every noble family in the city, and when
the subject was investigated legally, he had an opportunity of examining
all the documents,—and that he found the poison was a
solution of arsenic in <i>aqua cymbalariæ</i>.<a id='r678' /><a href='#f678' class='c013'><sup>[678]</sup></a> The dose was said to be
from four to six drops. It was colourless, transparent, and tasteless,
like water.</p>

<p class='c006'>Its alleged effects are thus eloquently described by Behrends, a
writer in Uden and Pyl’s Magazin. “A certain indescribable change
is felt in the whole body, which leads the person to complain to his
physician. The physician examines and reflects, but finds no symptom,
either external or internal,—no constipation, no vomiting, no
inflammation, no fever. In short, he can advise only patience, strict
regimen, and laxatives. The malady, however, creeps on; and the
physician is again sent for. Still he cannot detect any symptom of
note. He infers that there is some stagnation or corruption of the
humours, and again advises laxatives. Meanwhile the poison takes
firmer hold of the system; languor, wearisomeness and loathing of
food continue; the nobler organs gradually become torpid, and the
lungs in particular at length begin to suffer. In a word, the malady
is from the first incurable; the unhappy victim pines away insensibly,
even in the hands of his physician; and thus is he brought to a
miserable end through months or years, according to his enemy’s
desire.”<a id='r679' /><a href='#f679' class='c013'><sup>[679]</sup></a> An equally vigorous and somewhat clearer account of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>symptoms is given by Hahnemann. “They are,” says he, “a gradual
sinking of the powers of life, without any violent symptom,—a
nameless feeling of illness, failure of the strength, slight feverishness,
want of sleep, lividity of the countenance, and an aversion to
food and drink and all the other enjoyments of life. Dropsy closes
the scene, along with black miliary eruptions, and convulsions, or
colliquative perspiration and purging.”<a id='r680' /><a href='#f680' class='c013'><sup>[680]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Whatever were its real effects, there appears no doubt it was
long used secretly in Italy to a fearful extent, the monster who has
given her name to it having confessed that she was instrumental in
the death of no less than six hundred persons. It has been already
stated, however [p. <a href='#Page_40'>40</a>], that she owed her success rather to the ignorance
of the age than to her own dexterity. At all events, the art
of secret poisoning cannot now be easily practised. Indeed even the
vulgar dread of it is almost extinct. Partly on account of the improvement
in general knowledge and chiefly in consequence of the
subtility and precision, which the refinement of modern physic and
chemistry have introduced into medico-legal inquiries, it is rare that
the suspicious scrutiny of the world now “recognizes in the accounts
of the last illness of popes and princes the effects of poison insidiously
introduced into the body.”<a id='r681' /><a href='#f681' class='c013'><sup>[681]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>I may add in conclusion, that I was consulted a few years ago on
the part of the crown in a case which considerably resembled the
effects ascribed in former times to the aqua Toffana, except that it
was more acute in its character and swifter in its progress. As this
case will probably be found to represent pretty nearly the usual
effects of moderate doses frequently repeated, it is here given in some
detail.</p>

<p class='c006'>A woman of indifferent character married a young man in circumstances
which led to a breach between him and his relatives; but
the pair appeared to live on good terms with one another. Eighteen
months after the marriage she was attacked with sickness and faintness;
and on the fourth day of this illness, while she was recovering,
the symptoms unexpectedly increased, and she seemed very unwell.
On the fifth day she became extremely weak, and suffered much
from yellow vomiting. On the seventh, when she was first visited
by a medical man, she had frequent vomiting, burning in the stomach,
a yellow tongue, flushed countenance, hot skin, and hurried
pulse. On the ninth the throat was sore and red, and the expression
anxious; and next day the soreness was greater, affected the nose
and mouth also, and was attended with excoriation of the lips and
nostrils, swelling of the glands of the throat, dimness of sight, and
great exhaustion. On the eleventh day, while previously again getting
better, she became much worse, and suffered greatly from excessive
vomiting, pain in the stomach, and an increase of the other
symptoms. On the thirteenth she was very hoarse, and despaired of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>recovery. Next day she was occasionally incoherent, and had
twitches of the facial muscles; the hands and face were swelled, the
eyelids dingy, the conjunctivæ injected, and the nails blue. On the
morning of the fifteenth there was for two hours violent delirium and
fierce maniacal excitement, which were succeeded by coma, and this
by death in the course of the evening. There was no diarrhœa, or
urinary complaint, and no paralysis or eruption on the skin. A variety
of circumstances of a general nature, which it would be out of
place to enumerate here,—the detection of arsenic in various articles
of which the woman had partaken, and in which the arsenic had
been dissolved sometimes simply, sometimes with the aid of an
alkali,—together with the fact, that the body five months after death
was found preserved from decay, as it is now well known to be in
most cases of arsenical poisoning,—left little doubt that the woman
died of the effects of arsenic taken in several small doses at distant
intervals, although none could be detected in the stomach or intestines.
The case did not go to trial, owing to the death of an essential
witness.</p>

<p class='c006'>The effects of arsenic on man, when introduced into the living
body through other channels besides the stomach, will now require
some observations. It is necessary for the medical jurist to be well
acquainted with them, because there is hardly an accessible part of
the human body to which this poison has not been applied either
accidentally or by design. When some account was given of its
comparative action on the different tissues of animals, it was observed
that arsenic acts when applied to a wound or ulcer, to the peritonæal
membrane, to the eye, and to the vagina. On man it has been
known to act through an ulcer or wound, the inner membrane of the
rectum, the membrane of the vagina, the membrane of the air-tubes,
the membrane of the nose, and even the sound skin.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many persons have been poisoned by the application of arsenic to
surfaces deprived of the cuticle, such as blistered surfaces, eruptions,
ulcers, or wounds. When applied in this manner it commonly induces
both local inflammation and constitutional symptoms. Amatus
Lusitanus relates the case of a young man, who, against the advice
of his physician, anointed an itchy eruption of the skin with an arsenical
ointment, and next day was found dead in bed.<a id='r682' /><a href='#f682' class='c013'><sup>[682]</sup></a> A similar
case, not so rapidly fatal, has been recorded by Wepfer. A girl,
affected with psoriasis of the scalp, had it rubbed with a liniment of
butter and arsenic. In a short time she was seized with acute pain
and swelling of the whole head, fainting-fits, restlessness, fever, delirium,
and she died in six days.<a id='r683' /><a href='#f683' class='c013'><sup>[683]</sup></a> Zitmann has noticed the cases of
two children, eight and ten years of age, who were killed by the
application of an arsenical solution to a similar eruption of the head.<a id='r684' /><a href='#f684' class='c013'><sup>[684]</sup></a>
And Belloc relates the case of a woman who, trying to cure an inveterate
itch with an arsenical lotion, was attacked in consequence
with severe erysipelas of the whole body, succeeded by tremors and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>gradual exhaustion of the vital powers, ending fatally in two years.<a id='r685' /><a href='#f685' class='c013'><sup>[685]</sup></a>
M. Errard of Injurieux in France lately met with two cases, where,
in consequence of a freshly blistered surface being dressed with a
cerate made with the stearine of arsenicated candles (see p. <a href='#Page_256'>256</a>),
local pain, nausea, pain in the stomach, urgent thirst, redness of the
tongue, involuntary contractions of the muscles of the extremities,
and weakness and irregularity of the pulse came on; and one person
died within twenty-four hours, while the other recovered, chiefly
because the dressing caused so much pain that the patient could not
keep it on long.<a id='r686' /><a href='#f686' class='c013'><sup>[686]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Next as to ulcers; M. Roux has noticed the case of a girl, who
was killed by the application of the arsenical paste to an ulcer of the
breast, and in whom the constitutional symptoms were strongly
marked, although the quantity of the poison must have been very
small. The preparation used, which contains only a twenty-fourth
of its weight of arsenic, was applied for a single night on a surface
not exceeding an inch and a half in diameter. Yet she complained
next day of violent colic and vomited frequently, the countenance
soon became collapsed, and she died two days afterwards in great
anguish.<a id='r687' /><a href='#f687' class='c013'><sup>[687]</sup></a> Another instance of the like kind is related in the Annales
d’Hygiène, where death arose from an arsenical ointment ignorantly
applied for scirrhous breast over a large surface of the skin
stripped of the cuticle by a blister. The particular symptoms and
their duration are not stated; but there was violent irritation of the
stomach.<a id='r688' /><a href='#f688' class='c013'><sup>[688]</sup></a> Another fatal case, related by Dr. Küchler, arose from
the application of Frêre Cosme’s powder to a soft fungoid tumour on
the temple, which discharged serum usually and blood upon slight
pressure. About a drachm and a half of arsenic mixed with fifteen
grains of other powders was applied. Severe inflammation spread
round the tumour next day; and soon afterwards, the patient was
attacked with great difficulty of breathing, thirst, pains in the belly,
and purging, then with difficulty in swallowing from swelling of the
base of the tongue, delirium, cold sweating, and extreme debility;
and death ensued in four days.<a id='r689' /><a href='#f689' class='c013'><sup>[689]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>There is a singular uncertainty in the effects of arsenic when applied
to ulcerated surfaces. Some persons, like Roux’s patient, are
obviously affected by a single application; while others have had it
applied for a long time without experiencing any other consequences
than the formation of an eschar at the part. Two causes have been
assigned for these differences, and probably both are founded on fact.
One, which has been assigned by Mr. Blackadder, is the relative
quantity of arsenic applied. He says he never witnessed but one
instance of its acting constitutionally, although he often applied it to
sores; and he imputes this success to his having always used a large
quantity. For he considers that by so doing the organization of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>part is quickly destroyed, and absorption prevented,—but that if the
quantity be small, as in the mode practised by Roux, it will cause
little local injury and readily enter the absorbing vessels.<a id='r690' /><a href='#f690' class='c013'><sup>[690]</sup></a> Another
unequivocal cause is pointed out by Harles in his treatise on
arsenic. While treating of its therapeutic properties, and noticing
the controversy that prevailed last century throughout Europe respecting
the propriety of its outward application, he remarks that it
may be applied with safety to the abraded skin, to common ulcers,
to wounded surfaces, and to malignant glandular ulcers, even when
highly irritable, provided the part be not recently wounded, so as
to pour out blood.<a id='r691' /><a href='#f691' class='c013'><sup>[691]</sup></a> The reason of this is obvious; the application
of the poison to open-mouthed vessels is the next thing to its direct
introduction into a vein. It is some confirmation of Harles’s opinion,
that Roux, whose patient was so easily affected, recommends that
before arsenic is applied to an ulcer, a fresh surface be made by
paring away the granulations; and that Küchler’s patient had an
ulcer which did not discharge pus, but serum, and was easily made
to bleed.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the cases related above it will be remarked that the symptoms
vary in their nature. Sometimes the chief disorder is inflammation,
spreading over and around the eruption or ulcer, sometimes inflammation
of the alimentary canal, sometimes an affection of the nervous
system. In general the sufferings of the patient both from the
local inflammation and constitutional symptoms are very severe.
But this rule has its exceptions. In Pyl’s Memoirs there is the history
of a child who died four days after an itchy eruption of the
whole body had been washed with an arsenical solution, and signs
of vivid inflammation were found after death in many parts; yet she
appears to have complained only of headache.<a id='r692' /><a href='#f692' class='c013'><sup>[692]</sup></a> Occasionally too,
without exciting either inflammation of the part, or disorder of the
stomach, or a general injury of the nervous system, it seems to give
rise to partial palsy of the muscles adjoining the seat of its application.
An extraordinary case is noticed in an American Journal,
in which the prolonged use of an arsenical preparation for destroying
a tumour on the right side of the neck, was followed by complete
palsy of the muscles of the neck and arm of that side.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the next place, poisoning has been perpetrated by introducing
arsenic into the fundament with an injection.<a id='r693' /><a href='#f693' class='c013'><sup>[693]</sup></a> Foderé has noticed
a case of this kind, which happened in France, and was communicated
to him by a physician of Thoulouse. A lady under medical
treatment for some trifling illness, died unexpectedly under symptoms
of poisoning; and it was discovered that her servant, after
unsuccessfully attempting to despatch her by dissolving arsenic in
her soup, had ultimately succeeded by administering it repeatedly
in injections.<a id='r694' /><a href='#f694' class='c013'><sup>[694]</sup></a> There is no doubt that by this mode all the usual
effects of arsenic may be induced; and on account of the facility
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>with which the colon and rectum may be evacuated, it is not likely
that the poison will be found in the gut after death, if the individual
did not die in a few hours after its administration.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the third place, women have also died of poisoning by arsenic
introduced into the vagina. Two examples of this revolting crime
are on record. One of them occurred in 1799, in the Department
of the Ourthe in France. A middle-aged female was seized with
vomiting, diarrhœa, swelling of the genitals and uterine discharge;
and she expired not long after. Before her death she told two
of her neighbours, that her husband had some time before tried to
poison her by putting arsenic in her coffee, and had at length succeeded
by introducing a powder into her vagina while in the act of
enjoying his nuptial rights. The vulva and vagina were gangrenous,
the belly distended with gases, and the intestines inflamed.<a id='r695' /><a href='#f695' class='c013'><sup>[695]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The other case, which happened in Finland in 1786, gave rise to
an excellent dissertation on the subject by Dr. Mangor, at that time
medical inspector for Copenhagen. A farmer near Copenhagen
lost his wife suddenly under suspicious circumstances, and six weeks
afterwards married his maid-servant. In a few years he transferred
his affections to another maid-servant, with whose aid he endeavoured
to poison his second wife. For some time his attempts
proved abortive; till at last one morning, after coïtion, he introduced
a mixture of arsenic and flour on the point of his finger into
the vagina. She took ill at mid-day and expired next morning;
and the murderer soon after married his guilty paramour. But a few
years had not elapsed before he got tired of her also; and one morning,
after the conjugal embrace, he administered arsenic to her in
the same way as to her predecessor. About three in the afternoon,
while enjoying good health, she was suddenly seized with shivering
and heat in the vagina. The remembrance of her former wickedness
soon awoke the suspicions of the unhappy woman, and she
wrung from her husband a confession of his crime. Means were
resorted to for saving her life, but in vain: She was attacked with
acute pain in her stomach and incessant vomiting, then became
delirious, and died in twenty-one hours. After death grains of
arsenic were found in the vagina, although frequent lotions had been
used in the treatment. The labia were swollen and red, the vagina
gaping and flaccid, the os uteri gangrenous, the duodenum inflamed,
the stomach natural. In the course of the judicial proceedings which
arose out of these two cases, Dr. Mangor made experiments on mares,
with the view of settling the doubts which were entertained as to
the likelihood of arsenic proving fatal in the manner alleged; and
the results clearly showed that, when applied to the vagina of these
animals, it produces violent local inflammation and fatal constitutional
derangement.<a id='r696' /><a href='#f696' class='c013'><sup>[696]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In the fourth place, poisoning by arsenic through the bronchial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>membrane or membrane of the air-passages is a comparatively rare
accident, which can take place only in consequence of arsenical gases
or vapours being incautiously breathed. The effects of oxide of
arsenic when introduced in this way are described from personal
experience by Otto Tachenius, a chemist of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Once,” said he, “when I happened to breathe incautiously the
fumes of arsenic, I was surprised to find my palate impressed with
a sweet, mild, grateful taste, such as I never experienced before.
But in half an hour I was attacked with pain and tightness in the
stomach, then with general convulsions, difficult breathing, an unspeakable
sense of heat, bloody and painful micturition, and finally
with such an acute colic as contracted my whole body for half an
hour.” By the use of oleaginous drinks he recovered from these
alarming symptoms; but during all the succeeding winter he had a
low hectic fever.<a id='r697' /><a href='#f697' class='c013'><sup>[697]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Balthazar Timæus relates a similar case which came under his notice.
An apothecary of Colberg, while subliming arsenic, had not
been careful enough to avoid the fumes; and was soon after seized
with frequent fainting, tightness in the præcordia, difficult breathing,
inextinguishable thirst, parched throat, great restlessness, watching,
and pains in the feet. He had afterwards profuse daily perspiration
and palsy of the legs; and several months elapsed before he got entirely
well.<a id='r698' /><a href='#f698' class='c013'><sup>[698]</sup></a> The same author says that the famous Paracelsus, being
one day put out of temper by an acquaintance, made him hold his
nose over an alembic in which arsenic was subliming; and that the
object of this severe joke nearly lost his life in consequence. Wibmer
quotes the heads of several cases where swelling of the tongue,
headache and giddiness, nausea, and an oppressive sense of constriction
in the throat, were occasioned by the incautious inhalation of
arsenical fumes.<a id='r699' /><a href='#f699' class='c013'><sup>[699]</sup></a> The following extraordinary case, closely allied
to malignant cholera in its early stage, has been ascribed by the reporter
Dr. Welper of Berlin to the inspiration of arsenical fumes,—with
what probability I am not prepared to say. A stout healthy
man, who in the forenoon had freely and for some time exposed himself
to the steam from a vessel where he was boiling several ounces
of orpiment in water, was attacked at night with sickness, and next
morning with extreme weakness and some difficulty of breathing.
These symptoms were greatly relieved by an emetic. But towards
evening the extremities became ice-cold and very stiff, the breathing
much oppressed, the pulse very hurried, and imperceptible except
in the neck, the mouth and throat dry, and the tongue rigid; but the
mind remained clear, though anxious and afraid of impending dissolution.
His state of collapse was removed in twelve hours by fomentations,
and in no long time he recovered entirely except from
the dyspnœa, which continued more or less till a few years afterwards,
when he died of hydrothorax.<a id='r700' /><a href='#f700' class='c013'><sup>[700]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>The slighter effects of arsenic are said to have been repeatedly
observed of late in this country from inhaling the products of the
combustion of arsenicated candles,—an article of recent invention,
in which arsenic, to the extent of three or four grains and a half in
each candle, is introduced for the purpose of hardening the stearine
chiefly used in manufacturing them. It is unnecessary to say, that
such candles are prejudicial and ought to be prohibited. In a set of
experiments made to try their effects by Messrs. Everitt, Bird, and
Phillips in 1838, birds were killed in no long time, and small quadrupeds
were severely affected, when kept in an apartment lighted
with them.<a id='r701' /><a href='#f701' class='c013'><sup>[701]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Analogous to the effects of inhaling oxide of arsenic are those
lately observed from the incautious inhalation of arseniuretted-hydrogen
gas. Gehlen the chemist died of this accident, but no particular
account has been published of the symptoms he suffered. Two cases,
however, have been detailed within a few years. In one of these,
which has been related by Dr. Schlinder, of Greifenberg, the individual
inhaled in forty minutes about half a cubic inch of the gas,
which is equivalent to about an eighth of a grain of arsenic. In
three hours he became affected with giddiness, and soon afterwards
with an uneasy sense of pressure in the region of the kidney, passing
gradually into acute pain there and upwards along the back. General
shivering ensued, with coldness of the extremities, and gouty-like
pains in the knees, shoulders, and elbows. The hands and
lower half of the fore-arms, the feet and legs nearly to the knees,
the nose and region of the eyebrows, felt as if quite dead, but without
any diminution of muscular power. There was also acute pain
in the stomach and belly generally, painful eructation of gas, and occasional
vomiting of bitter, greenish-yellow mucus. The most tormenting
symptom, however, was the pain in the kidneys, which soon
became attended with constant desire to pass water, and the discharge
of deep reddish-brown urine, mixed with clots of blood.
The whole expression of the countenance was altered, the skin becoming
dark brown, and the eyeballs sunk, yellow, and surrounded
by a broad livid ring. Warm drink brought out a copious sweat
and removed the sense of numbness; but next day there was little
change otherwise in the symptoms, except that the urine was no
longer mixed with clots, and that the hair on the benumbed parts
had become white. On the third day the pains had abated, and the
urine became clear; but there was hiccup, an excited state of the
mind, and a feeling as if a great stone lay in the lower belly. In
seven days he was much better. In the third week the whole glans
and prepuce became covered with little pustules which were followed
by small ulcers. It was not till the close of the seventh week that
he recovered completely.<a id='r702' /><a href='#f702' class='c013'><sup>[702]</sup></a> Dr. O’Reilly has related the following
case, which arose from the inhalation of hydrogen gas impregnated
with arseniuretted-hydrogen in consequence of the sulphuric acid used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>for dissolving zinc having contained arsenic. Mr. Brittan, a Dublin
chemist, wishing to ascertain the effects of hydrogen on the body,
proceeded to inhale 150 cubic inches of it. Immediately after
the second inhalation, he was seized with confusion, faintness, giddiness
and shivering, and passed a stool, as well as two ounces of
bloody urine, but without any pain. Pain in the limbs followed,
and in two hours frequent vomiting and dull pain in the stomach.
The pulse at this time was 90, the skin cold, and the voice feeble.
Ammonia, laudanum, and emollient clysters gave him little relief.
During the subsequent night there was frequent vomiting and no
urine; the face became copper-coloured, and the rest of the body
greenish; there was tenderness of the epigastrium and hiccup; but
he was free of fever. On the third day there was diarrhœa and still
no urine; but the jaundice had disappeared. On the fourth the
breath was ammoniacal, and somnolency had set in. On the fifth
the skin became again deeply jaundiced, and the face was œdematous;
no urine had yet been discharged, and the bladder, examined
with the catheter, was found empty. On the evening of the seventh
day he expired. On examination of the body, two pints of red
serum were found in the pleural cavities; the lungs were sound, the
heart pale and flaccid, the liver indigo-blue, the gall-bladder distended
with bile, the kidneys also indigo-blue, the stomach empty,
and its villous coat brittle, with here and there inflamed-like spots
on it, the bladder empty, the brain bloodless, the cellular tissue generally
anasarcous. Arsenic was detected in the pleural serum.
By an approximate calculation it was supposed that the hydrogen
this gentleman inhaled had contained the equivalent arsenic of
twelve grains of the oxide.<a id='r703' /><a href='#f703' class='c013'><sup>[703]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It would appear that arsenic acts with great rapidity and force when
respired in any form.</p>

<p class='c006'>Poisoning through the lining membrane of the nostrils is a still
rarer accident than that last mentioned. There is a distinct example of
it in the German Ephemerides, which arose from an arsenical solution
having been used by mistake as a lotion for a chronic discharge from
the nostrils. The individual was attacked with a profuse discharge
from the nostrils, and then with stupor approaching to coma. Weakness
of sight and of memory continued after sensibility returned; and
he died two years afterwards, death having been preceded for some
time by convulsions.<a id='r704' /><a href='#f704' class='c013'><sup>[704]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Arsenic when applied to the sound skin of animals does not easily
affect them. The experiments of Jaeger formerly noticed prove that
no effect is produced, if the poison is simply placed in contact with
the skin. Nay even when rubbed into it with fatty matters it does
not operate with energy; for in that case, according to the experiments
of Renault, it causes sometimes a pustular eruption, sometimes
an eschar, but never any constitutional disorder.<a id='r705' /><a href='#f705' class='c013'><sup>[705]</sup></a> It is more energetic,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>however, when applied to the more delicate skin of the human
subject. Some experiments were made by Mr. Sherwen on himself
with the view of proving this;<a id='r706' /><a href='#f706' class='c013'><sup>[706]</sup></a> but they are not satisfactory. The
following facts, however, will show that it may produce through the
sound skin all the ordinary signs of poisoning. Desgranges, a good
authority, relates the case of a woman who anointed her head with
an arsenical ointment to kill lice, and, after using it several days, was
attacked with erysipelas of the head and face, attended with ulceration
of the scalp, swelling of the salivary and cervical glands, and
inflammation of the eyes. There were likewise violent constitutional
symptoms,—much fever, fainting, giddiness, vomiting and pain in
the stomach, tenesmus, and ardor urinæ, tremors of the limbs, and
even occasional delirium. Afterwards the whole body became covered
with an eruption of white papulæ, which dried and dropt off in
forty-eight hours. She recovered gradually; but appears to have
made a narrow escape. Her hair fell out during convalescence.<a id='r707' /><a href='#f707' class='c013'><sup>[707]</sup></a>
A similar instance is recorded in the Acta Germanica for 1730. A
schoolboy having found in the street a parcel of arsenic, his mother
mistook it for hair powder; and as he had to deliver a valedictory
speech at school next day, she advised him to powder himself well
with it in the morning. This he accordingly did. In the middle of
his speech he was attacked with acute pain of the face; and a fertile
crop of pustules soon broke out upon it. The head afterwards
swelled much, and the pustules spread all around it; he was tormented
with intolerable heat in the scalp; and the hair became matted with
the discharge into a thick scabby crust. This crust separated in a
few weeks, and he soon recovered completely.<a id='r708' /><a href='#f708' class='c013'><sup>[708]</sup></a> Schulze, a German
physician, has related no fewer than five cases of the same description,
all arising from arsenic having been mistaken for hair powder;
and one of them proved fatal. Two of the cases were slight. The
other persons had the same violent inflammation of the head as Desgranges’s
patient and the German schoolboy. In the fatal case death
took place in twenty-one days; and on dissection, besides other
morbid appearances, the scalp was found gangrenous and infiltered
with fluid blood, and the stomach much inflamed.<a id='r709' /><a href='#f709' class='c013'><sup>[709]</sup></a> The two survivors,
who were severely ill, it is well to add, were not attacked with
the erysipelas of the scalp till six days after they powdered themselves.
Sproegel mentions a fatal case from fly-powder having been applied
in like manner to the head; and Wibmer quotes another, but not
fatal, where from the same cause great swelling of the head and face
arose, followed by erysipelas of the face, neck, and belly, and a papular
eruption on the hands which continued five days.<a id='r710' /><a href='#f710' class='c013'><sup>[710]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>From the statements now made, it is evident that arsenic applied
to various parts of the external surface and natural apertures of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>body, will prove poisonous, and will often act with a certainty and
rapidity not surpassed by its effects when taken internally. Many
of the cases furnish a striking confirmation of a circumstance formerly
noticed with respect to its action,—namely, that it produces signs of
irritation in the stomach, in whatever manner it is introduced into the
body. In some instances, indeed, the signs of inflammation in the
stomach were quite as distinct as in the cases previously described,
where the poison was taken internally.</p>

<p class='c006'>The subject of the symptoms caused by arsenic will now be concluded
with a few remarks on the strength of the evidence which they
supply.</p>

<p class='c006'>The present doctrine of toxicologists and medical jurists seems
generally to be, that symptoms alone can never supply decisive proof
of the administration of arsenic. This opinion is certainly quite
correct when applied to what may be called a common case of poisoning
with arsenic, the symptoms of which are little else than burning
pain in the stomach and bowels, vomiting and purging, feeble
circulation, excessive debility, and speedy death. All these symptoms
may be caused by natural disease, more particularly by cholera;
and consequently every sound medical jurist will join in condemning
unreservedly the practice which prevailed last century of deciding
questions of poisoning in such circumstances from symptoms alone.
But modern authors appear to have overstepped the mark, when
they hold that the rule against deciding from symptoms does not
admit of any exceptions. For there are cases of poisoning with arsenic,
not numerous certainly, yet not very uncommon neither, which
can hardly be confounded with natural disease; and, what is of some
consequence, they are precisely those in which the power of deciding
from symptoms alone is most required, because chemical evidence is
almost always wanting. Either the peculiar combination of the symptoms
is such as cannot arise from natural causes, so far at least as
physicians are acquainted with them: or these symptoms occur under
collateral circumstances, which put natural causes almost or altogether
out of the question.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus, let the medical jurist consider in the first place, the symptoms
occasionally observed in those who survive five, six or ten days;
let him exclude for the present the secondary nervous affections; and
instead of a compounded description, which may be objected to as
apt to convey a false and exaggerated idea of the facts, let him take
an actual example. In a paper by Dr. Bachmann on some cases of
poisoning with arsenic, there is a minute account of the case of a
lady who was poisoned by her maid with fly-powder and white arsenic,
and whose symptoms were those of universal inflammation of the mucous
membranes. After suffering two days from retching and vomiting,
colic pains and purging, these symptoms suddenly became more
violent, and attended with oppressed breathing and hoarseness so that
she could hardly make herself be heard,—with vesicles on the palate,
burning pain in the throat, and excessive difficulty in swallowing,—with
spasm and pain of the bladder in passing water,—and with extreme
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>feebleness of the pulse. Three days afterwards the symptoms increased
still more. She complained of intolerable burning and spasms of the
throat, which, as well as the mouth, was excessively inflamed,—of
violent burning pain in the stomach and bowels,—of burning in the
fundament and genitals, both of which were inflamed even to gangrene,—of
indescribable anxiety and anguish about the heart;
and she died the following day, death being preceded by subsultus,
delirium, and insensibility.<a id='r711' /><a href='#f711' class='c013'><sup>[711]</sup></a> Or take the case in the trial of Miss
Blandy. On two successive evenings, immediately after taking some
gruel which had been prepared by the prisoner, Mr. Blandy was
attacked with pricking and burning of the tongue, throat, stomach,
and bowels, and with vomiting and purging. Five days after, when
the symptoms were fully formed, he had inflamed pimples round the lips,
and a sense of burning in the mouth; the nostrils were similarly affected;
the eyes were bloodshot and affected with burning pain; the tongue
was swollen, the throat red and excoriated, and in both there was a
tormenting sense of burning; he had likewise swelling, with pricking
and burning pain of the belly; excoriations and ulcers around the anus
and intolerable burning there; vomiting and bloody diarrhœa; a low,
tremulous pulse, laborious respiration, and great difficulty in speaking
and swallowing. In this state he lingered several days, death supervening
nine days after the first suspected basin of gruel was taken.<a id='r712' /><a href='#f712' class='c013'><sup>[712]</sup></a>
Can the symptoms, in these two cases, attacking, as they did, at one
and the same time, the whole mucous membranes, be imitated by any
natural combination of symptoms? Viewing the endless variety and
wonderful complexity of the phenomena of disease, the practitioner
will probably, and with justice, reply that a natural combination of
the kind is possible. But if his attention is confined, as in strictures
it ought to real occurrences,—if he is required to speak only from
actual experience, personal or derived, it is exceedingly questionable
whether any one could say he had ever seen or read of such a case.
At all events, if a medical witness had to give his opinion from
symptoms only in such a case as that of Mr. Blandy, or that described
by Bachmann, he would certainly be justified in declaring that poisoning
was highly probable; and, admitting general poisoning to be
proved, he would, it is likely, fix on arsenic as the substance which
could most easily produce the effects.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let him next, however, take also into consideration the nervous
affections that sometimes either immediately follow the inflammation
of the mucous membranes, or become united with it when it has existed
a few days; and confining his attention still to actual occurrences,
let him reflect on the symptoms in Dr. Roget’s case, in which there
was first violent inflammation of the whole alimentary canal, and then
regular and obstinate epilepsy (p. <a href='#Page_245'>245</a>), or on those in Dehaen’s
patient, in whom the nervous disorder was partial palsy (p. <a href='#Page_247'>247</a>). On
reconsidering these narratives, still greater reason will appear for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>doubting whether such a combination of simultaneous, and in the
present instance also consecutive symptoms, ever arise from natural
causes. It is difficult to conceive a fortuitous concurrence of natural
diseases producing at the same moment that variety and complexity
of disorder which occur in the primary stage of the cases alluded to;
and it would surely be a still more extraordinary combination which
should farther add the supervention of epilepsy or partial palsy from a
natural cause, at the exact period at which it appears as the secondary
stage of poisoning with arsenic. All that any practitioner could say
is, that a concurrence of the kind is within the bounds of possibility.
He must be compelled to admit that it is in the highest degree
improbable, and likewise that it could hardly take place from natural
causes without the real causes of the symptoms being clearly indicated.</p>

<p class='c006'>But to conclude, there are likewise collateral circumstances connected
with the symptoms, which, taken along with the symptoms
themselves, will sometimes place the fact of poisoning with arsenic
beyond the reach of a doubt. Thus, if a person were taken several
times ill with symptoms of general inflammation of the mucous membranes,
after partaking each time of a suspected article of food or
drink, the proof of the administration of arsenic would be very
strong indeed; and it would be unimpeachable if at length a nervous
affection succeeded at the usual period. Or above all, suppose
several persons, who have partaken of the same dish, are seized
about the same time with nearly the same symptoms of irritation of
the mucous membranes. The proof of general poisoning would then be
unequivocal. And if one or more of them should afterwards suffer
from a nervous disorder, little hesitation ought to be felt in declaring
that arsenic is the only poison which could have caused their complaints.</p>

<p class='c006'>These views are of more practical consequence than may at first
sight be thought. The doctrine which has been here espoused might
have been applied to decide two criminal cases which at the time
made a great noise in this country. One was the case of Eliza
Fenning (p. <a href='#Page_245'>245</a>). Here five persons were simultaneously attacked
with symptoms, more or less violent, of inflammation of the whole
alimentary canal; and in two of them epileptic convulsions appeared
before the inflammatory symptoms departed. The other was the case
of George Thom (p. <a href='#Page_247'>247</a>). Here four persons were at one and the
same time seized with the primary symptoms in an aggravated form;
and in two of them, as these symptoms abated, obstinate partial palsy
came on. On both trials, then, it might have been stated from the
symptoms alone that poison had been given, and that arsenic was the
only poison hitherto known to be capable of producing such effects.</p>

<p class='c006'>In applying this doctrine to parallel instances two precautions must
be attended to. On the one hand, care must be taken to ascertain,
as may always be done, that the simultaneous symptoms of general
irritation in the alimentary canal, arising soon after a meal, are not
owing to unsound meat having been used in preparing it. And on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>the other hand, which is of more consequence, the symptoms on
which so important an opinion is founded, must be strongly marked
and well ascertained by a competent person. The signs of irritation
in the mucous membranes must be really general and unequivocal;
and those of a disorder of the nervous system must be likewise
developed characteristically. Care must be taken in particular to
distinguish symptoms of the latter class from others which approach
to them in nature, and are the ordinary sequels of natural disease:
for example, the true palsy caused by arsenic must not be confounded
with the numbness and racking pains in the limbs, which occasionally
succeed cholera.</p>

<p class='c006'>With these precautions the evidence from symptoms may in certain
cases be decisive of the question of poisoning with arsenic.
And it is of moment to observe, as has been already hinted, that,
although such cases are numerous, they are precisely of the kind in
which it is most essential to the ends of justice that the symptoms
should, if possible, supply evidence enough to direct the judgment;
for the characteristic symptoms referred to occur chiefly when the
patient either recovers or survives many days, and where consequently
the chemical evidence, usually procured from the examination
of the contents of the stomach, is almost always wanting.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> III.—<i>Of the Morbid Appearances caused by Arsenic.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The morbid appearances caused by arsenic will next require some
details. In treating of them the same plan will be pursued as in the
preceding section: the various morbid appearances left by it will first
be mentioned in their order; and the subject will then be wound up
with some remarks on the force of the evidence from these appearances,
as they are usually combined in actual cases.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first instance, there are some cases in which little or no
morbid appearance is to be seen at all. These all belong to the
second variety of poisoning, which is characterized by the absence
of local inflammation, and the presence of symptoms indicating an
action on the heart, or some other remote organ. In such circumstances
death takes place before a sufficient interval has elapsed for
inflammation to be developed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Several examples of the absence of diseased appearances in the
dead body are to be found in authors. Thus in Chaussier’s case
formerly quoted (p. <a href='#Page_243'>243</a>), in that related by Metzger (p. <a href='#Page_242'>242</a>), in
another related by Etmuller, which was fatal in twelve hours,<a id='r713' /><a href='#f713' class='c013'><sup>[713]</sup></a> and
in a fourth related by Professor Wagner of Berlin, where life was also
prolonged for twelve hours under incessant vomiting,<a id='r714' /><a href='#f714' class='c013'><sup>[714]</sup></a> there was
positively no morbid alteration at all. Such was also the state of the
whole alimentary canal in the extraordinary case related by Orfila
(p. <a href='#Page_243'>243</a>). In the case quoted from the Medical and Physical Journal
(p. <a href='#Page_242'>242</a>), there was merely a slight redness at the pyloric end of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>stomach. In the case of the American grocer too, there was only
a little redness. In Mr. Wright’s case (p. <a href='#Page_243'>243</a>), there was scarcely
any morbid appearance,—nothing more than two small vascular
spots and a minute ecchymosis. In that which fell under my own
notice (p. <a href='#Page_242'>242</a>), the villous coat of the stomach was of natural firmness,
and had an exceedingly faint mottled-cherry-red tint, barely
perceptible in a strong light; and the rest of the alimentary canal,
as well as the body generally, was quite healthy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although in these examples the morbid appearances were trifling
or undistinguishable, it must not be supposed that the same happens
in all cases of rapid death from arsenic. In Gérard’s case, where the
usual irritant symptoms were wanting, and which proved fatal in five
hours, there was dark redness of the whole villous coat of the
stomach. In Mr. Holland’s case, fatal in eight or nine hours (p. <a href='#Page_243'>243</a>),
the stomach was of an intense purple colour at its pyloric end, and
contained bloody mucus; and the mucous coat of the cœcum presented
extensive softening and congestion. Mr. Alfred Taylor refers
to three cases observed by Mr. Forster of Huntingdon, in which the
mucous coat of the stomach was highly inflamed, though death took
place in 6½, 3½, and 2 hours only:<a id='r715' /><a href='#f715' class='c013'><sup>[715]</sup></a> in Mr. Hewson’s case, fatal in
five hours, the whole stomach was exceedingly vascular, and presented
both spots of extravasation, and several small erosions (p. <a href='#Page_201'>201</a>).
In a case alluded to at p. <a href='#Page_239'>239</a> as having fallen under my own observation,
and which was also fatal in five hours, the whole villous
coat of the stomach was intensely red, except where the folds of the
rugæ protected it from contact with the poison; and the prominences
of the rugæ presented corroded spots of ecchymosis. In Dr. Dymock’s
case, fatal in two hours and a half, the stomach, which I had an opportunity
of examining, presented on its mucous coat many scarlet
patches, and here and there a purplish appearance (p. <a href='#Page_240'>240</a>). Lastly,
an instance is related by Pyl of this poison proving fatal in three
hours, and leaving nevertheless in the dead body distinct signs of inflammation
in the stomach.<a id='r716' /><a href='#f716' class='c013'><sup>[716]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In the ordinary cases in which death is delayed till the second day
or later, a considerable variety of diseased appearances has been
observed. They are the different changes of structure arising from
inflammation in the alimentary canal, in the organs of the chest, and
in the organs of generation—together with certain alterations in the
state of the blood and condition of the body generally.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first set of appearances to be mentioned are those indicating inflammation
of the alimentary canal, viz., redness of the throat and
gullet,—redness of the villous and peritonæal coats of the stomach,
blackness of its villous coat from extravasation of blood into it,
softening of the villous coat, ulceration of that as well as of the other
coats, effusion of coagulable lymph on the inner surface of the
stomach, extravasation of blood among its contents,—finally, redness
and ulceration of the duodenum and other parts of the intestinal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>canal, and more particularly of the rectum; to which may also be added,
though not properly a morbid phenomenon, certain appearances put
on by the arsenic which remains undischarged.</p>

<p class='c006'>Redness of the throat and gullet is not common, at least it does
not often occur in the descriptions of cases. Jaeger, however, says
that in his experiments he usually found redness at the upper and
purplish stripes at the lower end of the gullet:<a id='r717' /><a href='#f717' class='c013'><sup>[717]</sup></a> and Dr. Campbell
likewise found the gullet red in animals,<a id='r718' /><a href='#f718' class='c013'><sup>[718]</sup></a> Similar appearances have
also been remarked in man. In the case of a man who lived eight
days, Dr. Murray found the gullet very red;<a id='r719' /><a href='#f719' class='c013'><sup>[719]</sup></a> in that of a woman who
lived scarce seven hours, Dr. Booth observed the gullet inflamed
downwards very nearly to the cardia;<a id='r720' /><a href='#f720' class='c013'><sup>[720]</sup></a> and Wildberg has reported
two cases of the same nature, in one of which it is worthy of remark
that the poisoning lasted only six hours.<a id='r721' /><a href='#f721' class='c013'><sup>[721]</sup></a> On the whole, it appears
probable that inflammation of the throat and gullet would be found
more frequently in the reports of cases, if it was more carefully looked
for.</p>

<p class='c006'>Redness of the inner coat of the stomach is a pretty constant effect
of arsenic, when the case is not very rapid. All the varieties of redness,
formerly mentioned among the effects of the irritant poisons
generally, may be produced by arsenic. There is nothing, however,
in the redness caused by this poison, any more than in the redness
of inflammation generally, by which it is to be distinguished from the
pseudo-morbid varieties. (See p. <a href='#Page_110'>110</a>.)</p>

<p class='c006'>It is singular, that, however severe the inflammation of the inner
membrane of the stomach may be, inflammatory redness of the peritonæal
coat is seldom found. Yet inflammatory vascularity does
occur sometimes on the peritonæal coat. Sproegel found it in animals;<a id='r722' /><a href='#f722' class='c013'><sup>[722]</sup></a>
and it was present in the case of the girl Warden, whose death
gave rise to the trial of Mrs. Smith.<a id='r723' /><a href='#f723' class='c013'><sup>[723]</sup></a> Dr. Nissen, a Danish physician,
has related another case in which the external coat of the stomach
appeared as if minutely injected with wax. But the patient
had been attacked with incarcerated hernia during the progress of
his illness, and the whole peritonæal membrane was in consequence
inflamed.<a id='r724' /><a href='#f724' class='c013'><sup>[724]</sup></a> A common appearance when the internal inflammation
is well marked, and one often unwarily put down as inflammation of
the peritonæum, is turgescence of the external veins, sometimes so
great as to make the stomach look livid.</p>

<p class='c006'>Blackness of the villous coat from effusion of altered blood into its
texture is sometimes met with. When the colour is brownish-black,
or grayish-black, not merely reddish-black, when the inner membrane
is elevated into firm knots or ridges by the effusion, and the
black spots are surrounded by vascularity or other signs of reaction,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>the appearances strongly indicate violent irritation. I have already
said that such appearances are never imitated by any pseudo-morbid
phenomenon.</p>

<p class='c006'>One of the most remarkable appearances occasionally observed in
the stomach in those instances where the body has been buried for at
least some weeks before examination, is the presence of bright yellow
patches, of various sizes, which appear as if painted with gamboge,
and obviously arise from the oxide of arsenic diffused throughout the
tissues having been decomposed and converted into sulphuret of
arsenic by the sulphuretted-hydrogen disengaged during putrefaction.
I have witnessed this appearance in several cases. In the case mentioned
at p. <a href='#Page_247'>247</a>, where the body had been buried twenty days,
numerous brilliant yellow patches were visible on the villous coat of
the stomach. In the case of a female who was poisoned about the
same time with that man, and, as was suspected, by the same individual,
the body was not examined till three months after interment;
and here broad, bright, yellow patches, disappearing under the action
of ammonia, were found under the peritonæal coat of the left end of
the stomach, the adjoining great intestine, and also the muscular
parietes of the abdomen. In the case of Mr. Gilmour, for whose
murder his wife was tried a few months ago in this city, but acquitted,—and
who undoubtedly died of poisoning with arsenic, howsoever
administered,—there were found fourteen weeks after death numerous
yellow streaks and patches both on the inner surface of the
stomach, on its outer surface under the peritonæum, on the adjoining
transverse colon, and on the small intestines in contact with the stomach.
From these and other parallel facts which have been occasionally
noticed by the periodical press, it seems probable that the
appearance in question is common in bodies which have been some
time buried. It is an extremely important part of the pathological
evidence. I doubt whether natural causes can occasion any appearance
similar to it. And indeed, what is it but the effect of a chemical
test applied to the poison by nature?</p>

<p class='c006'>The next appearance which may be mentioned is unnatural softness
of the villous coat of the stomach. This coat has certainly been
often found, after death from arsenic, unusually soft, brittle, and
easily separable with the nail.<a id='r725' /><a href='#f725' class='c013'><sup>[725]</sup></a> But the same state occurs in dead
bodies so often and so unconnected with previous symptoms of irritation
in the stomach, that it cannot with any certainty be assumed
as the effect of irritation when it is found subsequently to such symptoms.
So far from softening and brittleness being a necessary effect
of the irritation produced by arsenic, it is a fact that a condition
precisely the reverse has been also noticed. In a case which I examined,
the villous coat, except where it had been disintegrated by
effused blood and ulceration, was strong and firm; and the rugæ
were thickened, raised and corrugated, as if seared with a hot iron.<a id='r726' /><a href='#f726' class='c013'><sup>[726]</sup></a>
Metzger once found the mucous membrane dense, thickened, and
the rugæ like thick cords.<a id='r727' /><a href='#f727' class='c013'><sup>[727]</sup></a> Pyl too once met with the same appearance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>and ascribes the thickening to gorging of vessels;<a id='r728' /><a href='#f728' class='c013'><sup>[728]</sup></a> and in a
case related by Dr. Wood of Dumfries, where I had an opportunity
of examining the stomach, this appearance was present in a remarkable
degree, and it clearly arose from elevation of the villous
coat by effusion of blood under it.<a id='r729' /><a href='#f729' class='c013'><sup>[729]</sup></a> Remer, in his edition
of Metzger’s Medical Jurisprudence, says he once met with an
instance where the stomach was shrivelled like a bladder subjected
to boiling water.<a id='r730' /><a href='#f730' class='c013'><sup>[730]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Sometimes the villous and also more rarely the other coats of the
stomach are found actually destroyed and removed in scattered spots
and patches. This loss of substance is occasionally owing to the
same action which causes softening and brittleness of the villous coat,—the
action, however, having been so intense as to cause gelatinization.
That such is the nature of the process appears from the breach
in the membrane being surrounded by gelatinized tissue, and not by
an areola of inflammatory redness. Of this species of destruction
of the coats I have seen a characteristic example.<a id='r731' /><a href='#f731' class='c013'><sup>[731]</sup></a> But in other
cases the loss of substance is owing to a process of ordinary ulceration,
as is proved by the little cavities having a notched irregular
shape, and being surrounded both by a red areola and a margin of
firm tissue. This was the character of the ulcers in the case of
Warden, which I have described elsewhere.<a id='r732' /><a href='#f732' class='c013'><sup>[732]</sup></a> Destruction of the
coats of the stomach by ulceration is not a very common consequence
of poisoning with arsenic, as death frequently takes place before
that process can be established. It does not often occur, unless
the patient survive nearly two days. Mr. Alfred Taylor, however,
mentions a case fatal in seventeen hours where he found ulceration
of the stomach, and another fatal in ten hours where several
small ulcers were seen on the lesser curvature, and two nearly circular
ones as big as a sixpence.<a id='r733' /><a href='#f733' class='c013'><sup>[733]</sup></a> Mr. Hewson too informs me he found
many eroded spots even in his case which proved fatal in five hours (p.
<a href='#Page_56'>56</a>). I suspect, however, that spots of healthy membrane surrounded by
vascular redness are sometimes mistaken for ulcers in such cases;
for indeed nothing can more exactly resemble them. In many general
works on Medical Jurisprudence, and in some express treatises
on arsenic, it is stated that this poison may cause complete perforation
of the stomach.<a id='r734' /><a href='#f734' class='c013'><sup>[734]</sup></a> But this effect is exceedingly rare. I have
related one distinct example of it;<a id='r735' /><a href='#f735' class='c013'><sup>[735]</sup></a> Professor Foderé has briefly alluded
to a case he witnessed which proved fatal in two days and a
half;<a id='r736' /><a href='#f736' class='c013'><sup>[736]</sup></a> I have likewise found in an account of a trial in North America,
an instance in which the stomach was perforated by numerous
small holes, so that when held before the light it appeared as if riddled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>like a sieve;<a id='r737' /><a href='#f737' class='c013'><sup>[737]</sup></a> but I have not been able to find in medical
authors any farther authority for the general statement. Destruction
of the coats of the stomach as produced by arsenic has been variously
described by authors under the terms erosion, corrosion, dissolution,
ulceration. But the correct mode of describing it appears
to be by the terms gelatinization, or ulceration, according to the nature
of the diseased action by which it is induced. At all events it
is necessary to beware of being misled by the terms erosion, corrosion,
and the like, which all convey the idea of a chemical action;
while it is well ascertained that a chemical action either does not
exist at all between arsenic and the animal tissues, or, if it has existence,
tends to harden and condense rather than to dissolve or
corrode them. Arsenic is not a corrosive.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another species of destruction of the coats of the stomach, which
will require a little notice, is sloughing or gangrene. This appearance
occurs frequently in the narratives of the older writers; but
it has not been enumerated in the list of morbid appearances at the
commencement of this section, because its existence as one of the
effects of arsenic is problematical. It has not been witnessed so far
as I know by any recent good authority. Those who have mentioned
it have probably been misled by the appearance put on by the
black extravasated patches, when they are accompanied by disintegration
of the villous coat and effusion of clots of black blood on its surface—an
appearance which resembles gangrene closely in everything but
the fetor. Sir B. Brodie has stated that Mr. John Hunter has preserved
in his museum, as an example of a slough of the villous coat
caused by arsenic, which turned out on examination to be nothing
else than an adhering clot.<a id='r738' /><a href='#f738' class='c013'><sup>[738]</sup></a> It is clear too, that, when Mr. James
speaks of having found “several gangrenous patches” on the villous
coat of the stomach, and “patches of sphacelus” in the intestines, on
examining the body of a notorious French criminal, Soufflard, who
poisoned himself with arsenic in prison in 1839, he mistook for gangrene
what was merely extravasation; for the man lived only twelve
hours.<a id='r739' /><a href='#f739' class='c013'><sup>[739]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Various secretions have been found on the inner surface of the
stomach. The mucous secretion of the inner membrane is generally
increased in quantity. Frequently it is thin, but viscid, as in its natural
state; but sometimes it is both abundant and solid, as if coagulated;
and then it forms either a uniform attached pellicle, or loose
shreds floating among the contents.<a id='r740' /><a href='#f740' class='c013'><sup>[740]</sup></a> In both forms it has been
mistaken for the mucous membrane itself. I believe this increased
secretion and preternatural firmness of the gastric mucus cannot take
place without some irritating agent being applied to the stomach.
Both may occur without any other sign of inflammation in the mucous
membrane. In a case of suicide after seduction which came under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>my notice in this city in 1843, and which proved fatal in five hours
[p. <a href='#Page_239'>239</a>], the mucus in the stomach, which was very abundant, put
on the appearance of curdled milk, owing to its being rendered
opaque and white by the large quantity of finely powdered arsenic
diffused through it; and it was actually mistaken for curdled milk by
several medical men.—Sometimes the matter effused is true coagulable
lymph. This is rarely seen as the effect of arsenic. I have
remarked it, however, very distinctly in dogs, and Dr. Baillie saw it
once in the human subject.<a id='r741' /><a href='#f741' class='c013'><sup>[741]</sup></a> It is of course quite decisive of the
presence of inflammation. It is known from tough mucus, to which
it bears some resemblance, by its reticulated disposition, and by the
threads of the reticulation corresponding with inflamed lines on the
stomach beneath.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another very common appearance is the presence of a sanguinolent
fluid, or even actual blood in the cavity of the stomach. In several
of the cases which have come under my own notice, the subject of
analysis was a thick, dirty brownish-red fluid, evidently containing
a large proportion of blood; and many other examples of the same
nature are on record.<a id='r742' /><a href='#f742' class='c013'><sup>[742]</sup></a> In Laborde’s case formerly mentioned actual
clots were found among the contents; in the instance of a woman
who died in five days, as related by Zittmann, half a pound of coagulated
blood was found in the stomach;<a id='r743' /><a href='#f743' class='c013'><sup>[743]</sup></a> and in another case mentioned
by Professor Bernt, the stomach contained no less than three
pounds of black ichor mixed with clots of blood.<a id='r744' /><a href='#f744' class='c013'><sup>[744]</sup></a> A good deal of
reliance has been placed on bloody effusion in proof of the administration
of arsenic or some other active irritant. It is of some importance,
as it appears not to be an effect of that irritation which
causes cholera.</p>

<p class='c006'>Among the appearances observed in the stomach the presence of
arsenic may be included, though not properly speaking a morbid
appearance. Under the head of the medical evidence of poisoning
generally it was stated, that many causes conspire to remove from
the stomach during life poisons which have actually caused death.
In addition to the illustrative cases there alluded to, I may here also
refer to an interesting case communicated to me by Mr. J. H. Stallard,
and already noticed for a different purpose [p. <a href='#Page_235'>235</a>]. Arsenic in no
large quantity had been swallowed in tea, and death took place in
four hours only. Here none of the poison could be detected by
Marsh’s process, either in the contents of the stomach, or in its tissues,
or in the liver.—In the instance of arsenic, however, the operation
of the causes which tend to remove the poison is prevented by various
circumstances, in particular by its insolubility and firm adhesion
to the stomach. Hence it happens, that even after long-continued
vomiting a portion still generally remains behind, either in the contents
of the stomach or in its tissues. Sometimes the arsenic exists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>dissolved in the contents; more commonly it is present there in the
solid form; and is then either in loose particles, or enveloped in coagulated
mucus,<a id='r745' /><a href='#f745' class='c013'><sup>[745]</sup></a> or in little clots of blood,<a id='r746' /><a href='#f746' class='c013'><sup>[746]</sup></a> or is wrapped up in the
more solid parts of the contents.<a id='r747' /><a href='#f747' class='c013'><sup>[747]</sup></a> Frequently it adheres to the coats
of the stomach, and is then either scattered in the form of fine dust
or collected in little knots. The adhering particles are always covered
by mucus; they are often surrounded by redness of the membrane
or by effused blood; and sometimes they are imbedded in little
ulcers.—A remarkable appearance which the arsenic sometimes puts
on is a brilliant yellowness of its surface, owing to its conversion into
the sulphuret. This appearance existed in six cases which have
come under my own notice, first in one related in the Edinburgh
Medico-Chirurgical Transactions,<a id='r748' /><a href='#f748' class='c013'><sup>[748]</sup></a> next in the instance of Margaret
Warden,<a id='r749' /><a href='#f749' class='c013'><sup>[749]</sup></a> again in the case of a young woman whose death gave
rise to the trial of John Lovie held at Aberdeen in the Autumn Circuit
of 1827, again in a case described by Dr. Wood, which I had an
opportunity of examining;<a id='r750' /><a href='#f750' class='c013'><sup>[750]</sup></a> and lastly, in two others which I had occasion
to examine in 1842 and 1843. In one of these, the case of
Mr. Gilmour, adverted to at p. <a href='#Page_265'>265</a>, Drs. Wylie and M’Kinlay, who
examined the body in the country, found the inner surface of the
stomach thickly sprinkled with small yellow particles, some of which
were very bright. In all of these cases oxide was found, as well as
the sulphuret of arsenic. In the case related by Dr. Nissen [p. <a href='#Page_264'>264</a>],
a similar yellow appearance, observed on the surface of the arsenic,
was ascribed with justice to the action of sulphuretted hydrogen-water,
which had been given as an antidote during life.<a id='r751' /><a href='#f751' class='c013'><sup>[751]</sup></a> In a very
important case examined here a few years ago by my colleague Dr.
Traill, and which will be noticed more particularly for a different
purpose afterwards, this conversion of the oxide into sulphuret had
taken place to a great extent [p. <a href='#Page_277'>277</a>]. In every instance of the kind
yet examined, however, the conversion has been only partial, so that
a large proportion of oxide could easily be detected by the usual
process.</p>

<p class='c006'>Care must be taken not hastily to consider as arsenic every white
powder which may be found lining the inside of the stomach. Many
other white powders may obtain entrance from without; and besides,
small, white, shining, pulverulent scales, not unlike finely powdered
arsenic, but rarely composed of animal matter, sometimes form naturally
on the mucous coat of the stomach and intestines. In a medico-legal
report published a few years ago, Professor Orfila has
noticed two instances in which these scales were mistaken for arsenic;<a id='r752' /><a href='#f752' class='c013'><sup>[752]</sup></a>
in another published not long after he mentions that he found white
particles which crackled when bruised, and appeared brilliant before
the microscope, and which nevertheless were not arsenic.<a id='r753' /><a href='#f753' class='c013'><sup>[753]</sup></a> Buchner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>too says he is acquainted with an instance where, in a medical inspection
on account of a suspicion of poisoning, the villous coat of
the stomach was found lined with a white granular substance which
presented the properties of a fat and contained no mineral admixture;<a id='r754' /><a href='#f754' class='c013'><sup>[754]</sup></a>
and in the case of Warden I remarked a similar appearance,
which, as arsenic was found in the stomach, I was disposed
to consider a sprinkling of that poison, until the contrary was ascertained
by analysis. The present caution, therefore, is not superfluous.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a few cases the stomach is the only situation where morbid appearances
are visible, even though life has been prolonged for so
much as two days. This state of matters is well exemplified by a
French case of death in forty-three hours, where the stomach presented
much redness and extravasated patches, but where the intestines,
the larynx and the contents of the head and chest were in a
natural condition.<a id='r755' /><a href='#f755' class='c013'><sup>[755]</sup></a> Such limitation, however, of the diseased appearances
are rare.</p>

<p class='c006'>Redness of the mucous membrane of the intestines is often present
when the stomach is much inflamed. Dissolution of the mucous
coat is much less frequent in the intestines than in the stomach. Ulceration
occasionally occurs in lingering cases. In the case of
Mitchell, which has been several times alluded to, the inner coat of
the duodenum was dark-red, pulpy, thickened, easily separable; and
on a spot as big as a crown piece, both the inner and the muscular
coats were wanting.<a id='r756' /><a href='#f756' class='c013'><sup>[756]</sup></a> Perforation of the small intestine was found in
a case communicated to me by Mr. Sandell, and detailed at page
<a href='#Page_277'>277</a>. But as the person survived only eight hours, and had laboured
under symptoms of disease in the bowels for some days before taking
the arsenic, it is unlikely that this appearance, which has not been
observed, to my knowledge, in any other instance, arose from the
action of the poison.</p>

<p class='c006'>The signs of inflammation are seldom distinct in the small intestines
much lower down than the extremity of the duodenum; and they
do not often affect the colon. But the rectum is sometimes much inflamed,
though the colon, and more particularly the small intestines,
are not. Dr. Male mentions, that in  man he has found the rectum
abraded, ulcerated, and even redder than the stomach itself;<a id='r757' /><a href='#f757' class='c013'><sup>[757]</sup></a> and
Dr. Baillie also notices two cases in which the lower end of the rectum
was ulcerated.<a id='r758' /><a href='#f758' class='c013'><sup>[758]</sup></a> A common appearance in lingering cases is
excoriation of the anus,<a id='r759' /><a href='#f759' class='c013'><sup>[759]</sup></a> and it is said that even gangrene has been
produced.<a id='r760' /><a href='#f760' class='c013'><sup>[760]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>A late writer draws attention to the fact that in the only two fatal
cases he had seen the whole colon was contracted to an extraordinary
degree;<a id='r761' /><a href='#f761' class='c013'><sup>[761]</sup></a> and this state is mentioned in other cases. The appearance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>deserves notice; but of course whatever empties the colon
thoroughly will have the same effect.</p>

<p class='c006'>The chief appearances in the alimentary canal have now been
mentioned. The next quarter in which deceased appearances are to
be met with is the cavity of the chest. Here are sometimes seen
redness of the pleura, redness and congestion of the lungs, redness of
the inner surface of the heart, and redness of the lining membrane of
the windpipe.</p>

<p class='c006'>Redness of the diaphragmatic part of the pleura, or even of the
whole of that membrane, has been at times observed; as one would
expect, indeed, from the pectoral symptoms which occasionally prevail
during life. Inflammation of the lungs themselves has also been
noticed. Dr. Campbell twice found great congestion of blood in the
lungs of animals poisoned by the application of arsenic outwardly.<a id='r762' /><a href='#f762' class='c013'><sup>[762]</sup></a>
Sproegel likewise found the pleura, pericardium, and whole lungs
deeply inflamed in animals.<a id='r763' /><a href='#f763' class='c013'><sup>[763]</sup></a> Dr. Venables found the pleura of a
bright crimson colour in some poultry maliciously poisoned with arsenic,—more
redness there indeed than in the stomach.<a id='r764' /><a href='#f764' class='c013'><sup>[764]</sup></a> Mr. James
says that in his experiments on animals he constantly found the lungs
much gorged with blood, unless when death occurred quickly; but
that he could see no evidence of the congestion being inflammatory.<a id='r765' /><a href='#f765' class='c013'><sup>[765]</sup></a>
A distinct example of advanced pneumonia in man is related in Pyl’s
Magazine: the patient died after vomiting and purging incessantly
for eight days; and on dissection the lungs were found “in the
highest state of inflammation; and so congested as to resemble a lump
of clotted blood.”<a id='r766' /><a href='#f766' class='c013'><sup>[766]</sup></a> A distinct case of the same nature is related in
Henke’s Journal; this patient had obvious pneumonic symptoms
during life; and in the dead body the lungs were found so gorged,
that, on being cut into, nothing could be seen but clotted blood in
their cellular structure.<a id='r767' /><a href='#f767' class='c013'><sup>[767]</sup></a> In a case formerly adverted to [p. <a href='#Page_252'>252</a>] of
death from arsenic applied externally for scirrhus, excessive congestion
was found in the lungs, “both lungs being completely gorged
with blood, and presenting all the characters of pulmonary apoplexy.”<a id='r768' /><a href='#f768' class='c013'><sup>[768]</sup></a>
In another described by Dr. Booth of Birmingham,
where death occurred in seven hours only, the lungs presented sufficient
congestion to have completely impeded respiration.<a id='r769' /><a href='#f769' class='c013'><sup>[769]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It has been alleged that the inner surface of the heart has been
found red from inflammation. In a case examined judicially at
Paris by Orfila, the left cavities of the heart were of a mottled red
hue, and in the ventricle were seen many small crimson specks
which penetrated into the muscular part of the parietes. The right
cavities had a deep reddish-black tint, and the ventricle of that side
contained specks like those in the other, but more faint. Orfila adds,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>that he had previously seen the same appearance in animals.<a id='r770' /><a href='#f770' class='c013'><sup>[770]</sup></a> These
observations are not satisfactory. There is no evidence that the
observer drew the distinction between the redness of inflammation,
and that produced by the dyeing of the membrane with blood after
death. The subject was afterwards brought before the Royal Academy
of Medicine at Paris by M. Godard, who had also observed the
appearance in question in a person killed by arsenic, and who dwelt
strongly on it as characteristic of this species of poisoning. It was
distinctly proved, however, by many members present that the appearance
arises from various other causes.<a id='r771' /><a href='#f771' class='c013'><sup>[771]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The inner membrane of the windpipe is said to be sometimes
affected with inflammatory redness. Jaeger found it so in animals;<a id='r772' /><a href='#f772' class='c013'><sup>[772]</sup></a>
and the symptoms referrible to the windpipe during life would lead
us to expect the same thing in man.</p>

<p class='c006'>The organs of generation are occasionally affected. The penis in
the male and the labia in the female have been found distended and
black; in an interesting case related by Bachmann the external parts
of generation (in a female) were surrounded by gangrene;<a id='r773' /><a href='#f773' class='c013'><sup>[773]</sup></a> and in
a case related in Pyl’s collection the inside of the uterus and Fallopian
tubes was inflamed.<a id='r774' /><a href='#f774' class='c013'><sup>[774]</sup></a> It is probable that signs of inflammation
in the internal organs of generation will be found if there have been
corresponding symptoms during life. But in truth this part of the
pathology of poisoning with arsenic has not been particularly attended
to.</p>

<p class='c006'>To complete this account of the morbid appearances of the mucous
membranes, it may be added that the conjunctiva of the eyes
frequently presents vascularity and spots of extravasation.<a id='r775' /><a href='#f775' class='c013'><sup>[775]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It now only remains, under the head of the morbid appearances
produced by arsenic, to mention certain alterations that are said to
take place in the state of the blood and general condition of the
body.</p>

<p class='c006'>With regard to the state of the blood Sir B. Brodie observes in
general terms, that in animals killed by arsenic it is commonly fluid.<a id='r776' /><a href='#f776' class='c013'><sup>[776]</sup></a>
Harles, on the authority of Wepfer, Sproegel, and Jaeger, says it is
black, semi-gelatinous, and sometimes pultaceous.<a id='r777' /><a href='#f777' class='c013'><sup>[777]</sup></a> Novati alleges
that the blood after death is without exception black and liquid as
after cholera, of a blackish-purple tint that colours linen reddish-brown,
viscid, opaque, and without any trace of coagulation.<a id='r778' /><a href='#f778' class='c013'><sup>[778]</sup></a> In a
fatal case related by Wildberg the blood was everywhere fluid.<a id='r779' /><a href='#f779' class='c013'><sup>[779]</sup></a>
This condition, however, is not uniform; for Dr. Campbell found
the blood coagulated in the heart of a rabbit;<a id='r780' /><a href='#f780' class='c013'><sup>[780]</sup></a> and Wepfer found it
also coagulated in the dog.<a id='r781' /><a href='#f781' class='c013'><sup>[781]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>It has been stated by some authors in medical jurisprudence that
the dead body occasionally exhales an aliaceous odour, resembling
that of sublimed arsenic. This is a very questionable statement.
The only fact of the kind worth mentioning is one brought forward
by Dr. Klanck, as occurring in the course of certain experiments,
which will presently be noticed, on the antiseptic virtues of arsenic.
Several animals which had been killed with arsenic are said to have
exhaled an odour like that of sublimed arsenic from three to eight
weeks after death.<a id='r782' /><a href='#f782' class='c013'><sup>[782]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>A great discordance of opinion at one time prevailed among
authors, as to the influence of arsenic on the putrefactive process in
the bodies of those poisoned with it. The vulgar idea, borrowed
probably from the ancient classics, that the bodies of those who have
been poisoned decay rapidly, was till lately the prevalent doctrine
of medical men, and even of medical jurists; and it was applied to
arsenic as well as other poisons. Even so lately as 1776 we find
Gmelin stating in his History of Mineral Poisons, that the bodies of
those who have died of arsenic pass rapidly into putrefaction, that
the nails and hair often fall off the day after death, and that almost
the whole body quickly liquefies into a pulp.<a id='r783' /><a href='#f783' class='c013'><sup>[783]</sup></a> A similar statement
has been made in 1795 by a respectable author, Dr. John Johnstone.<a id='r784' /><a href='#f784' class='c013'><sup>[784]</sup></a>
It appears that this rapid or premature decay does really occur in
some instances. Thus in a case related by Plattner of death from
arsenic administered as a seasoning for mushrooms, the body had a
very putrid odour the day after death.<a id='r785' /><a href='#f785' class='c013'><sup>[785]</sup></a> Loebel also asserts he
found by experiments on animals, that after death from arsenic putrefaction
took place rapidly, even in very cold weather.<a id='r786' /><a href='#f786' class='c013'><sup>[786]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In other instances the body probably decays in the usual manner.
For example, in Rust’s Magazin is related the case of a child who
died in six hours of poisoning with arsenic, and in whose body,
fourteen days after death, the integuments were found considerably
advanced in putrefaction, and the liver and kidneys beginning to
soften.<a id='r787' /><a href='#f787' class='c013'><sup>[787]</sup></a> In the case of a man who died in two days, and in whose
body arsenic was found by MM. Chapeau and Parisel throughout
many of the tissues, “putrefaction was so far advanced eight days
after death as to render the examination of parts obscure.”<a id='r788' /><a href='#f788' class='c013'><sup>[788]</sup></a> And
in the course of some experiments on dogs poisoned with the oxide
Dr. Seeman found the usual changes after five months’ interment.<a id='r789' /><a href='#f789' class='c013'><sup>[789]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>But it has been proved in recent times that in general arsenic has
rather the contrary tendency—that, besides the antiseptic virtues
which it has been long known to exert when directly applied in
moderate quantity to animal substances, it also possesses the singular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>property of enabling the bodies of men and animals poisoned with it
both to resist decay unusually long, and to decay in an unusual manner.
The observations and inquiries which have been made abroad
on this subject were little known any where else than in Germany
before the publication of the earlier editions of the present work;
but parallel examples have been since met with both in Britain and
France; and in this country the importance of the subject is generally
appreciated.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first occasion on which the antiseptic property of arsenic was
brought under public notice was about the beginning of the present
century, in the course of the trial of the widow of a certain state-councillor,
Ursinus of Berlin. Some time before that Dr. Welper,
then medical inspector in the Prussian capital, having remarked that
the body of a person poisoned with arsenic remained quite fresh for
a whole week in summer, he attended carefully to the subject at
every opportunity, and invariably, he says, found that the body resisted
putrefaction. Not long after making this remark, he was concerned
in 1803, by virtue of his office, in the investigations in the
case of the widow Ursinus. This lady having been discovered in an
attempt to poison her servant, suspicions arose regarding the previous
sudden death of three persons in her family, her husband, a young
officer who had carried on an amour with her, and an aunt from
whom she derived an inheritance. They had all died in mysterious
circumstances, and the lady had been their only nurse. Dr. Welper
disinterred the bodies of the husband and aunt, which had been
buried, the former two years and a half before at Berlin, the latter
half a year afterwards at Charlottenberg; and he found them not
putrid, but dried up; and specks of an appearance, which is described
as being gangrene, but which was probably warty extravasation,
were visible in the stomach. Arsenic could not be detected.</p>

<p class='c006'>He afterwards got Dr. Klanck, his acquaintance, to make some
express experiments on animals; and the results were strikingly
conformable. In dogs poisoned with arsenic and left for two months
sometimes buried in a damp cellar, sometimes exposed to the air of
the cellar, the flesh and alimentary canal were red and fresh, as if
pickled; and though the place where the carcases were subsequently
buried again was flooded for eight months after, the intestines were
eventually found entire and red, the fat converted into adipocire,
and most of the muscles unaltered,—those only being soft and greasy
which were directly acted on by the water. From a set of comparative
experiments which were made on dogs killed by blows, or
poisoned by corrosive sublimate, or by opium, Klanck found, that,
after being buried in the same place, and for the same space of time
the whole soft parts of the carcases were converted into a greasy
mass. In a subsequent year he repeated his experiments, the bodies,
however, being this time left exposed to the air of the cellar. The
experiments were commenced in the month of August. In ten days
there appeared slight signs of incipient putrefaction; a faint putrid
smell was exhaled, and all flies that settled on the carcase died.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>This state continued for eight or ten weeks without increasing.
After that the soft parts began to grow firmer and drier, and at the
same time the putrid odour was succeeded by a smell like that of
garlic, which became insupportably strong when the carcases were
removed into warm air. The bodies, three years afterwards, still
continued dry and undecayed.<a id='r790' /><a href='#f790' class='c013'><sup>[790]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>A similar set of facts was again brought before the public between
1809 and 1811, during the criminal proceedings in a case like that of
the widow Ursinus, tried first at Bayreuth and afterwards by appeal
at Munich. A lady near Bayreuth died of five days’ illness, under
symptoms of violent general irritation of the alimentary canal. Some
months afterwards a variety of circumstances having raised a suspicion
that she had been poisoned by her maid, Margaretha Zwanziger,
a judicial investigation was set on foot; the consequence of
which was, that the same woman came under suspicion of having
also previously poisoned another lady and a gentleman with whom
she had been successively in service. The bodies of the three people
were accordingly disinterred, one of them five months, another
six months, and the third fourteen months after death. In all of
them the external parts were not properly speaking putrid, but
hard, cheesy, or adipocirous; in the last two the stomach and intestines
were so entire as to allow of their being tied, taken out, cut
up, and handled; and in one a sloughy spot was found in the region
of the pylorus. Arsenic was detected in two of the bodies by Rose’s
process of analysis.<a id='r791' /><a href='#f791' class='c013'><sup>[791]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The next example to the same effect which will be mentioned is
perhaps the most satisfactory of all, because it was the result of an
express experiment on the human subject. Dr. Kelch of Königsberg
buried the internal organs of a man who had died of arsenic, and
whose body had remained without burial till the external parts had
begun to decay; and on examining the stomach and intestines five
months after, he found that the hamper in which they were contained
was very rotten; but that “they had a peculiar smell, quite different
from that of putrid bowels, were not yet acted on by putrefaction,
but as fresh as when first taken from the body, and might have
served to make preparations. They had lost nothing of their colour,
glimmer, or firmness. The inflamed spots on the stomach had not
disappeared, and the small intestines also showed in some places the
inflammatory redness unaltered.”<a id='r792' /><a href='#f792' class='c013'><sup>[792]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In a recent French case, although the degree of preservation was
less remarkable, the other circumstances are so striking as to render
it well worthy of notice. In this instance the body was disinterred
after having been seven years in the ground, in a high situation and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>sandy soil. The coffin, which was of oak, had become dry and
brittle, and no moisture appeared on the inside. The body was entire:
the head, trunk, and limbs retained their situation; but the
organs of the chest and belly were converted into a brown soft mass
of the consistence of plaster, which lay on each side of the spine.
In this mass MM. Ozanam and Idt, the medical inspectors, succeeded
in discovering by chemical analysis a considerable quantity of
arsenic.<a id='r793' /><a href='#f793' class='c013'><sup>[793]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>M. Ollivier describes another French case, where the body had
been buried for three years, and was found so completely dried up
that the trunk weighed only two pounds. The integuments were
entire, dark-brown, and of a faint odour like decayed wood. The
organs of the chest and belly were confounded together in a foliaceous
membranous mass, in which the liver only could be distinguished,
but in an exceedingly shrivelled state. Arsenic was detected
in the membranous matter by MM. Barruel and Henri. The
preservative power of the arsenic was promoted in this case by the
sandy nature of the soil.<a id='r794' /><a href='#f794' class='c013'><sup>[794]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In the case of the girl Warden, which has been several times alluded
to, the internal organs were also preserved somewhat in the
same manner as in the German cases. The body had been buried
three weeks; yet the mucous coat of the stomach and intestines, except
on its mere surface, was very firm, and all the morbid appearances
were consequently quite distinct. Nay, three weeks after disinterment,
except that the vascularity had disappeared, the membranes
and the appearances in them remained in the same state.<a id='r795' /><a href='#f795' class='c013'><sup>[795]</sup></a> A
similar case has been recorded by Metzger. It is that of an old man
who died of six hours’ illness, and in whose stomach three drachms of
arsenic were found. The body had been kept ten days in February
before burial, and was disinterred eight days after that; yet there
was not the slightest sign of putrefaction any where.<a id='r796' /><a href='#f796' class='c013'><sup>[796]</sup></a> A parallel
case was described by myself in the Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical
Transactions;<a id='r797' /><a href='#f797' class='c013'><sup>[797]</sup></a> and I have met with three others of the same kind
since.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a very important case, that of Mrs. Smith, which was made the
subject of investigation at Bristol in December, 1834, the body was
also found in a state of great preservation, modified, however, by
adipocirous decomposition, owing to the presence of water in the
coffin. The body had been fourteen months interred. The internal
parts, especially of the head and neck, were here and there decayed
somewhat or converted into adipocire, the muscles and internal
organs entire, though more or less shrivelled, the alimentary tube
remarkably preserved, “every part being almost as distinct as if the
inspection had been made at a very short period after death,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>“the mucous membrane sufficiently tenacious to be lifted by the
forceps in as large flakes as usual;” and the reporters, Drs. Riley
and Symonds, Messrs. Herapath and Kelson, seem to have had no
difficulty in ascertaining the absence of vascularity, extravasation, or
even abrasion of the inner membrane. Artificial orpiment, the
preparation proved to have been given [see p. <a href='#Page_225'>225</a>], was found in
the stomach by Mr. Herapath, and the quantity appeared to be
about half a drachm.<a id='r798' /><a href='#f798' class='c013'><sup>[798]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>A similar instance, very remarkable in all its circumstances, was
investigated here in 1834 by my colleague Dr. Traill to whom I am
indebted for the particulars. The master of a foreign vessel died in
about twenty-four hours, apparently of malignant cholera, at a small
port in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh: and the body was forthwith
buried. A suspicion, however, having arisen in his native
country that he had been poisoned by his mate, an inquiry was instituted
at the request of the foreign government; and the body
was disinterred five months after death. The face and neck was
swollen, black, and decayed; but the rest of the body was quite free
of the usual signs of putrefaction. The skin was white and firm, the
muscles fresh, the lungs crepitating, the liver and spleen much shrivelled,
the stomach and intestines entire throughout their whole
tissues, and capable of being handled freely without injury. On
the mucous coat of the stomach several dark patches of extravasation
were found, likewise several spots and large patches which
presented on their surface a firmly adhering bright yellow crust;
and the contents of the stomach consisted of a considerable quantity
of yellow sandy matter of the consistence of paste. The contents
and adhering crusts were found to consist chiefly of oxide of
arsenic partially converted into sulphuret. In this instance, as in that
last described, the coffin contained water, owing to its having laid
in a sandy soil resting on clay.</p>

<p class='c006'>An important case of the same nature was communicated to me in
1843 by Mr. Sandell of Potton, Bedfordshire, and afterwards published
by Mr. Hedly of Bedford. A man Dazley at Wrestlingford,
affected with symptoms of gastro-enteric irritation for five or six
days, was seized with sickness, vomiting, heat and constriction in the
throat, and great weakness, about an hour after getting a white
powder from his wife; and in eight hours he expired, without any
suspicion of unfair usage arising at the time. Suspicions, however,
being entertained afterwards, the body which had not been examined
at first, was disinterred in five months, during the month of
March. The countenance was so entire as to be recognisable. Adipocire
had been formed in many places. The stomach and intestines
were “in a most perfect state of preservation,” as if death
had taken place only a few days previously. The stomach presented
yellow patches on its outer and inner surface,—was generally
red over its villous coat, which had also been abraded near the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>cardiac end,—and, together with the small intestines, was lined
with white powder and contained more of it enveloped in much red
mucus. This powder proved to be arsenic. About the middle of
the small intestines a small ulcerated opening was found, through
which some arsenic had escaped.<a id='r799' /><a href='#f799' class='c013'><sup>[799]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The following cases which have come under my own notice during
the last five years are also worthy of observation. In a case submitted
to me on the part of the crown in 1841, which has been adverted
to above for another purpose [p. <a href='#Page_265'>265</a>], the body after being
three months interred was found with the head and face decayed
and putrid; but the muscular substance was little changed; and the
inspectors were particularly struck with the state of preservation of
the body, and also with the very distinct state of inflammation seen
over almost the whole external and internal surfaces of the alimentary
canal,—a description, the accuracy of which I had afterwards
an opportunity of verifying. In the case of Mr. Gilmour (p. <a href='#Page_265'>265</a>),
whose body had been buried 101 days, the external parts were more
decayed; but the alimentary canal appeared equally entire both to
the original inspectors, Drs. M’Kinlay and Wylie, and likewise to
myself three weeks later. But the following instance, in which I was
consulted in 1839, is the most remarkable one of the kind that has
hitherto occurred to me; because the observations then made were
the result of an express experiment in a medico-legal investigation.
The history of this case, which arose from small doses of arsenic frequently
administered, has been already given above in some detail
[p. <a href='#Page_250'>250</a>]. Arsenic not having been detected in the contents or tissues
of the stomach, and the trial of the individual suspected of giving
the poison being necessarily postponed for some months, I recommended
that a third examination of the body,—for it had been twice
disinterred for inspection within ten days after death,—should be
made at as distant an interval as possible, in order to ascertain whether
it underwent preservation from decay. It was accordingly disinterred
again, five months after death. It had an ammoniacal, but not a
putrid odour. The skin was here and there covered with a thin sebaceous
matter, at one or two places stripped of the epidermis, but for
the most part natural in appearance, firm, and elastic. The nails
were loose. The muscles of the head and near the tops of the scapulæ
were adipocirous, on the chest and abdomen obscurely fibrous
in texture and hardened, but elsewhere unaltered, and “in the lower
extremities so perfect that they might have been used for an anatomical
demonstration.” The liver and lungs were also in a state of
good preservation, and the latter crepitated when cut. The other
viscera had been removed at the previous examinations.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be added that the experiments of Klanck on dogs adverted
to above have been more recently repeated by Hünefeld on rabbits
and mice, with precisely the same results. The animals were sometimes
left in the air, at other times buried, and generally in a moist
place. In every instance putrefaction made more or less progress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>at first; but in a few days a peculiar garlicky odour arose, from which
time the progress of decay seemed to be arrested; and the bodies
underwent a process of hardening and desiccation which completely
preserved them.<a id='r800' /><a href='#f800' class='c013'><sup>[800]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>On considering attentively the illustrations now given, the toxicologist
can hardly doubt that in some cases arsenic has appeared
both to retard and to modify putrefaction in the bodies of persons
poisoned with it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Assuming arsenic to have been the cause of the preservation of the
bodies, it becomes a point of consequence to account for its effect,
and more particularly to reconcile that effect with what has certainly
been noticed in other cases of poisoning with the same substance,
namely, ordinary rapidity of decay, if not actually an increased tendency
to putrefaction.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the outset of this part of the inquiry some light may be thrown
upon it by separating the local from the general operation of arsenic.</p>

<p class='c006'>Arsenic is a good preservative of animal textures when it is directly
applied to them in sufficient quantity. This is well known to
stuffers of birds and beasts, was experimentally ascertained by Guyton
Morveau,<a id='r801' /><a href='#f801' class='c013'><sup>[801]</sup></a> and has come also under my observation.<a id='r802' /><a href='#f802' class='c013'><sup>[802]</sup></a> It is now
likewise known to be an excellent substance for preserving bodies,
when injected in the form of solution into the blood-vessels.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hence, if in a case of poisoning the arsenic be not discharged by
vomiting, and the patient die soon, it will act as an antiseptic on the
stomach at least, perhaps on the intestines also; while the rest of the
body may decay in the usual manner. This is very well shown in
a case examined by Dr. Borges, medical inspector at Minden, fourteen
weeks after death. The stomach and intestines were firm, of a
grayish-white colour, and contained crumbs of bread, while all the
other organs in the belly were pulpy, and the external parts adipocirous.<a id='r803' /><a href='#f803' class='c013'><sup>[803]</sup></a>
It is also equally well exemplified in a case that happened
at Chemnitz so early as 1726, and which was examined five
weeks after burial. The skin was every where very putrid, but the
stomach and intestines were perfectly fresh.<a id='r804' /><a href='#f804' class='c013'><sup>[804]</sup></a> In the case of Warden
the appearances were precisely the same. Three weeks after
burial the Dundee inspectors found the external parts much decayed,
yet three weeks later the stomach and intestines were found by myself
in a state of almost perfect preservation. A striking experiment
performed by Dr. Borges on a rabbit will likewise illustrate clearly
the fact now under consideration. The rabbit was killed in less than
a day with ten grains of arsenic, and its body was buried for thirteen
months in a moist place under the eaves of a house. At the end of
this period it was found, that “the skin, muscles, cellular tissue,
ligaments and all the viscera, except the alimentary canal, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>disappeared, without leaving a trace; but the alimentary canal
from the throat to the anus, along with the hair and the bare bones,
was quite entire.”<a id='r805' /><a href='#f805' class='c013'><sup>[805]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In all of these cases arsenic was found in the body. In the rabbit
experimented on by Dr. Borges, above five grains of arsenic were
separated in the form of a metallic sublimate.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, on the contrary, if the arsenic is all or nearly all discharged
by vomiting, not only the body generally, but likewise even the
stomach and intestines, may follow the usual course of decay. Accordingly,
in the case of the child formerly quoted (<a href='#Page_273'>273</a>), where the
body putrified in the usual manner, only four grains and a half of
arsenic had been taken; and as it was swallowed in a state of solution
and caused violent vomiting, it must have been almost all ejected.
Nay, in such circumstances, the alimentary canal, in consequence of
its unnatural supply of moisture and incipient disorganization, may
decay somewhat faster than other parts. Thus Dr. Murray observed
in the case of a man formerly mentioned (<a href='#Page_264'>264</a>), who lived under violent
gastritic symptoms for seven days, and vomited much, that the
stomach, which was removed for more minute examination, decayed
so rapidly that in twenty-four hours an examination was impracticable,
while the body in general rather resisted putrefaction.<a id='r806' /><a href='#f806' class='c013'><sup>[806]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The preceding statements on the differences in the state of preservation
of the body after poisoning with arsenic are not then incapable
of some explanation. Nevertheless, it must be granted that the
reasons assigned will not account for all the apparent cases of the preservative
powers of arsenic. And especially they will not explain
how the whole body has sometimes resisted decay altogether, and become
as it were mummified. It is impossible to ascribe this preservation
to the spelling power of the arsenic diffused throughout the
body in the blood; the quantity there being extremely small. Consequently
if the preservation of the bodies is not occasioned by some
accidental collateral cause (a mode of accounting for the phenomena
which seems inadmissible), this property of arsenic must depend on
its causing, by some operation on the living body, a different disposition
and affinity among the ultimate elements of organized matter,
and so altering the operation of physical laws on it. There appears
no sound reason for rejecting this supposition, especially as it is necessary
to admit an analogous change of affinities as the only mode
of accounting for a still more incomprehensible violation of the ordinary
laws of nature,—the spontaneous combustion, or preternatural
combustibility, of the human body.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following judicious observations by Harles on this subject are
worthy of attention:—“In regard,” says he, “to this singular property
of arsenic, now no longer doubtful, it should be remembered
that certain circumstances will limit or impair it, while others will
favour or increase it;—circumstances, for example, connected with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>the soil of the burying-ground, or the air of the vaults where the
bodies are deposited. Different soils and different conditions of the
air will materially affect the decomposition of all bodies indiscriminately,
and will therefore affect likewise the antiseptic properties of
arsenic. For it would be absurd to ascribe to arsenic the power of
preventing putrefaction in all circumstances whatsoever,—a power
which those who make use of it for preserving skins know very well
it does not possess, and a power possessed by no antiseptic whatever,
not even by alcohol.”<a id='r807' /><a href='#f807' class='c013'><sup>[807]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>An important consequence of the preservative tendency of arsenic
is, that in many instances the body in this kind of poisoning may
be found long after death in so perfect a state as to admit of an accurate
medico-legal inspection and a successful chemical analysis.
In one of his cases Dr. Bachmann detected arsenic in the stomach
fourteen months after interment; Dr. Borges had no difficulty in detecting
it in an animal after thirteen months; Mr. Herapath discovered
it after fourteen months in the human body; M. Henry detected it
after three years and a half, and obtained no less than seven grains
of metallic arsenic from the shrivelled viscera;<a id='r808' /><a href='#f808' class='c013'><sup>[808]</sup></a> and MM. Ozanam
and Idt found it after the long interval of seven years.—The late
experiments of Orfila and Lesueur confirm the fact that arsenic may
remain long in contact with decaying animal matter, and yet continue
in such a state as to be easily detected.<a id='r809' /><a href='#f809' class='c013'><sup>[809]</sup></a> It might be supposed that
the poison would pass off partly in the gaseous state by being converted
into arseniuretted-hydrogen, partly in the liquid state by becoming
arsenite of ammonia, a very soluble compound. But the fact nevertheless
is, that, notwithstanding these reasons for its disappearance,
it may be detected after the lapse of several years.</p>

<p class='c006'>Under the head of the diseased appearances left by arsenic in the
dead body, every change of structure has now been described which
has been mentioned by authors and supported by trustworthy statements.
Another set of appearances may still be noticed; but they
are here separated from the rest, because the author who first notices
them has not been supported in the statement by any special observations
of his own, or by an adequate number of facts observed by
others. In an elaborate essay on a case of poisoning by Professor
Seiler of Wittemberg, it is said in general terms that arsenic may
cause gorging of the vessels of the brain, effusion of serum into the
ventricles, inflammation of the brain, and even extravasation of
blood.<a id='r810' /><a href='#f810' class='c013'><sup>[810]</sup></a> Turgescence of vessels is mentioned in several published
cases, and I have myself met with it. But it is seldom so considerable
as to attract attention. In the following instance, however, which
has been related by Dr. Hofer of Biberach the evidence of cerebral
congestion was unequivocal. A man addicted to intoxication, but
enjoying good health otherwise, was attacked after supper with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>sickness, vomiting, and pain in the belly. On going to bed he fell
soon quiet; and six hours after he took ill, he was found dead.
Arsenic was detected in the stomach, and in what he vomited; and
considerable redness was seen on the villous coat of the stomach.
But the most remarkable appearances were gorging of the cerebral
vessels, adhesion of the dura mater to the membranes beneath, and
the effusion of eight ounces of serosity into the lateral ventricles.<a id='r811' /><a href='#f811' class='c013'><sup>[811]</sup></a>
The only instance I am acquainted with to justify the opinion that
extravasation of blood into the brain may occur from poisoning with
arsenic, is the remarkable case of apparent death from eating poultry
poisoned with arsenic, which was communicated to me by Mr. Jamieson
of Aberdeen. The individual, after suffering under the usual
primary symptoms, became apoplectic after a fit of sneezing, and
died three days afterwards; and in the dead body, besides other signs
of disease in the brain, a recent clot of blood was found in the right
anterior lobe. (See p. <a href='#Page_69'>69</a>.)</p>

<p class='c006'>It is quite unnecessary to notice lividity of the skin among the signs
of poisoning with arsenic, except for the mere purpose of reminding
the medical jurist that, although it has been sometimes much relied
on as a sign of death from arsenic, it is not of the slightest importance
as a sign either of that or of any other kind of poisoning.
(See p. <a href='#Page_51'>51</a>.)</p>

<p class='c006'>The action of arsenic on the alimentary canal after death will now
require a few remarks; the purpose of which is to prepare the medical
inspector for investigating attempts to impute the crime of poisoning
to innocent persons, by introducing arsenic into the dead body. Such
attempts, according to Orfila, have been made; but I am not acquainted
with any actual instance.</p>

<p class='c006'>The action of arsenic on dead intestine has been fully examined
by the last mentioned author. If it is introduced into the anus immediately
after death, and allowed to remain there twenty-four hours,
the mucous membrane in contact with it becomes of a lively red
colour, with darker interspersed patches as if from extravasation.
The other coats are natural; and so is the mucous membrane itself
wherever the poison does not actually touch it. Consequently the
margin of the coloration is abrupt and well defined. When the arsenic
is not introduced till twenty-four hours after death, the part to
which it is actually applied presents dark patches, while the rest of
the membrane is quite healthy.<a id='r812' /><a href='#f812' class='c013'><sup>[812]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The appearance of redness in the former case is probably the result
of lingering vitality. The cause of the dark appearance in the latter
it is not easy to comprehend.</p>

<p class='c006'>When arsenic has been applied, during life, the redness, if it has
had time to begin at all, extends to some distance from the points
with which the poison has been in contact, and passes by degrees
into the healthy colour of the surrounding membrane.</p>

<p class='c006'>On reviewing what has been said of the pathological appearances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>caused by arsenic, it must appear that the medical jurist can never be
supplied from this source alone with satisfactory evidence of the cause
of death. But in some circumstances the evidence may amount to a
strong probability of one variety or another of irritant poisoning.
Mere redness, conjoined or not with softening of the mucous membrane,
may justify suspicion only. But if there should be found in the
body of a person who has died of a few days’ illness, redness, black warty
extravasation, and circumscribed ulcers of the villous coat of the stomach,—effusion
of blood or bloody clots among the contents of that organ,—also
redness of the intestines, more especially redness and ulceration
of the colon and rectum,—and redness of the pharynx, or of
this along with the gullet,—the proof of poisoning with some irritant
will amount to a strong presumption. At least it is difficult to mention
any natural disease which could produce in so short a time such
a conjunction of appearances as this; which arsenic and other analogous
poisons sometimes occasion.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> IV.—<i>On the Treatment of Poisoning with Arsenic.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>It was formerly proved that arsenic acts in all its forms of chemical
combination, which have been hitherto tried, and nearly in the ratio
of their solubility. This general fact is conformable with the law laid
down as to the influence of chemical changes on the energy of poisons
which enter the blood [p. <a href='#Page_37'>37</a>]. Hence every supposed chemical antidote
must be useless, which does not render the arsenic insoluble
not only in water, but likewise in the contents and secretions of the
stomach.</p>

<p class='c006'>The antidotes chiefly trusted to until recent times, such as vinegar,
sugar, butter and other oily substances, lime-water, bitter decoctions,
and the like, have now justly fallen into disuse. The liver of sulphur
or sulphuret of potassium, which maintained its character for
some time longer on account of its chemical action with oxide of
arsenic in solution, is not more efficacious. The experiments of
Renault on the counter-poisons for arsenic, confirmed by the subsequent
researches of Orfila, have proved that the arsenical sulphuret formed
by solutions of the liver of sulphur is scarcely less active than the
oxide itself.<a id='r813' /><a href='#f813' class='c013'><sup>[813]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It appears that fine impalpable powders, though inert as physiological
agents, and destitute of any true chemical action with oxide of
arsenic, may nevertheless prove useful in certain limited circumstances.
Thus Mr. Hume of London and others have apparently found some
advantage in the administration of large doses of magnesia.<a id='r814' /><a href='#f814' class='c013'><sup>[814]</sup></a> If this
substance be of any use at all, which is doubtful, it can act only by
covering the arsenical particles with its fine insoluble powder, and so
preventing them from coming in contact with the surface of the stomach;
for in its state of magnesia it has no chemical action with oxide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>of arsenic. Another remedy of the same nature is charcoal powder,
which was proposed in 1813 with much confidence by M. Bertrand.<a id='r815' /><a href='#f815' class='c013'><sup>[815]</sup></a>
That it has some efficacy when swallowed along with the poison seems
to admit of no doubt; for the proposer of it himself swallowed five
grains of arsenic in one dose along with charcoal in a state of emulsion,
and sustained little inconvenience of any kind. In all probability
it acts merely by enveloping the particles of arsenic. But it
may possibly be also of service, if recently exposed to heat, by the
superficial attraction it exerts over substances in solution; through
means of which property it will remove many soluble substances
from a fluid, and render them insoluble. Charcoal, however, has
been proved to be destitute of all efficacy when not administered till
after the arsenic is swallowed. The one must be given along with
the other, otherwise it is useless.<a id='r816' /><a href='#f816' class='c013'><sup>[816]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>For some time past the formation of an insoluble arsenite has been
aimed at by most experimentalists who have endeavoured to discover
an antidote for arsenic. But in general the arsenites, though very
insoluble in water, are sufficiently so in weak acids or in organic
fluids, so that they are soluble enough in the juices of the stomach to
enter the blood in such quantity as to prove fatal. The only exception
now admitted to exist is the arsenite produced when a solution
of oxide of arsenic is brought in contact with the hydrated sesquioxide
of iron. The compound thus formed is held to be insoluble
in the secretions of the stomach; and consequently the hydrated
sesquioxide of iron is usually regarded as a true antidote.</p>

<p class='c006'>The substance, the Ferrugo of the Edinburgh Pharmacopœia,—a
compound which differs little from the older preparation, the rust of
iron, when not deprived of its combined water,—was announced in
1834 by Drs. Bunsen and Berthold as an effectual remedy even when
given some time after the arsenic is swallowed.<a id='r817' /><a href='#f817' class='c013'><sup>[817]</sup></a> Their experiments
were repeated with variable success. Similar results were obtained
by MM. Soubeiran and Miquel, as well as MM. Orfila and Lesueur,
in some experiments on dogs, and by M. Boullay on the horse.<a id='r818' /><a href='#f818' class='c013'><sup>[818]</sup></a>
The last experimentalist found that the effects of a dose adequate ta
occasion death are almost entirely prevented in the horse by giving
the oxide of iron either immediately after the poison, or within four
hours. Results of the same nature were obtained in this country by
Mr. Donald Mackenzie.<a id='r819' /><a href='#f819' class='c013'><sup>[819]</sup></a> Others, however, such as Mr. Brett<a id='r820' /><a href='#f820' class='c013'><sup>[820]</sup></a> and
Mr. Orton,<a id='r821' /><a href='#f821' class='c013'><sup>[821]</sup></a> have failed to observe any antidotal virtues, and even
deny that the sesquioxide of iron can remove oxide of arsenic from
a state of solution. But in 1840 the causes of these discrepant
statements were explained by Dr. Douglas Maclagan,<a id='r822' /><a href='#f822' class='c013'><sup>[822]</sup></a> who found,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>in corroboration of the remarks of Drs. Bunsen and Berthold, as
well as various French authorities, that the oxide must be given in
large quantity, and that the failures of some were owing to the quantity
used having been too small. He ascertained, that, in order to
remove one part of arsenic from a state of solution, twelve parts of
oxide of iron in the moist state are necessary, and sixty parts if it be
previously dried; that the arsenic so appropriated is with difficulty
removed from the insoluble matter even by boiling; and that, as the
discoverers of this antidote first stated, the preparation made by precipitating
the sesquioxide of iron by means of ammonia, is a more
active form than any other. As the oxide prepared in this way
always contains ammonia, and the proportion necessary for removing
the arsenic is far greater than what is required to constitute a simple
arsenite of iron, it is reasonable to infer that the ammonia forms a
part of the insoluble compound actually produced. At all events the
action of the antidote would appear to be chemical, and not mechanical,
as has been thought by many, and as was stated to be probable
in the last edition of this work. In confirmation of these views, and
as a fact worthy of farther investigation on its own account, it is
worthy of notice, that, according to Dr. Duflos, the acetate of sesquioxide
of iron answers equally well as an antidote with the sesquioxide
itself. It precipitates both arsenious and arsenic acid from
every state of solution, and always the more quickly the more the
solution is diluted; and the co-existence of acetic acid is no obstacle
to this action taking place.<a id='r823' /><a href='#f823' class='c013'><sup>[823]</sup></a>—More recently Professor Orfila has
called in question the absolute efficacy generally ascribed to the
sesquioxide of iron. He alleges that the arsenical compound formed,
though insoluble in water, is soluble to some extent in the gastric
juices, and is consequently a poison to animals; that the sesquioxide
is therefore only partial in its operation as a remedy; but yet that
the influence of the animal fluids in the stomach in counteracting it
may be overcome by giving it in excess, so that, as fast as the compound
is dissolved, it is thrown down again.<a id='r824' /><a href='#f824' class='c013'><sup>[824]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The cases of the successful employment of this antidote in the
human subject, which have appeared in the periodical press during the
last eight years, are so numerous, that its utility can scarcely be called
in question, whatsoever may be its precise mode of action. The
hydrated sesquioxide of iron ought therefore to be kept in readiness
in every druggist’s establishment; for it cannot be prepared when
wanted without great loss of time. The quickest way to make it is
to dissolve the common anhydrous sesquioxide, formerly miscalled
carbonate of iron, in diluted sulphuric acid aided with a gentle heat;
to decompose the hot solution with an excess of strong ammonia; to
filter off the fluid by means of a cloth filter and wash the precipitate
well with warm water; and then to let it drain thoroughly and to
squeeze out more of the water by expression. It should be kept in
this state, and not allowed to dry.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>In regard to all antidotes for arsenic, it must be observed, that
they can seldom be otherwise employed than in unfavourable circumstances.
If, as most generally happens, the poison has been taken
some time before medical aid is obtained, its powder is diffused over
the surface of the stomach, adheres with tenacity to the villous coat,
and excites the secretion of tough mucus, through which it is with
difficulty reached by any antidote possessing a chemical action with
it. In all cases, therefore, it is advisable to promote vomiting occasionally,
if not already full and free, so as to aid the stomach in clearing
itself of the secreted mucus.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the existence of a chemical antidote for arsenic be doubtful,
much less is there any one known of that rarer denomination which
operates by exciting in the system an action contrary to that established
by the poison.</p>

<p class='c006'>A good deal, however, may be done by general medical treatment
to improve the chance of recovery. If vomiting should be delayed,
as often happens, for half an hour or more, advantage ought to be
taken of the opportunity to administer an emetic of the sulphate of
zinc, with the view of withdrawing the powder in mass before it is
diffused over the stomach; and for the same purpose milk should be
drunk both before and after vomiting has begun, as it appears to be
the best substance for enveloping the powder, and so procuring its
discharge. The patient should never be allowed to exhaust his
strength in retching without a little milk or other fluid in his stomach to
act on. At the same time, there is probably some justice in the
opinion expressed by a late writer on this subject, that large draughts
of diluents are injurious; and that, unless the stomach is allowed to
contract fully and frequently on itself, it cannot discharge from its
surface the mucous secretion, in which the powder of arsenic is in
general closely enveloped.<a id='r825' /><a href='#f825' class='c013'><sup>[825]</sup></a> The stomach-pump, although it has
been applied to cases of poisoning with arsenic, does not possess any
advantage whatever over emetics or the natural efforts of nature, and
is less effectual in expelling the mucus which envelopes the poison.
Even emetics are unnecessary, when full vomiting is caused by the
poison itself. If milk in sufficient quantity cannot be procured, strong
farinaceous decoctions will probably prove useful.</p>

<p class='c006'>Supposing the poison to have been removed from the stomach, or
that the patient has been put on the course which appears best fitted
to accomplish that end,—two objects remain to be accomplished,
namely, to allay the inflammation of the alimentary canal, and to support
the system under that extraordinary depression which it undergoes
in the generality of cases. Were it not for the latter of these
objects, the treatment would be both obvious and frequently successful.
But it is highly probable that the active remedies, to which the
physician trusts in internal inflammations generally, and which are
urgently called for by the inflammation caused by arsenic, cannot be
enforced with the requisite vigour, on account of the remote depressing
effects also produced by this poison on the body.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>Nevertheless, it is certain that in a few even very aggravated cases
the purest and most vigorous antiphlogistic treatment has been resorted
to with success. Dr. Roget’s patient, whose case was formerly
referred to for another purpose, seems to have been saved by venesection;
and at all events, the amelioration effected was unequivocal.
In the Medical Repository there is another good example of the beneficial
effects of blood-letting carried even to a greater extent than in
Roget’s case;<a id='r826' /><a href='#f826' class='c013'><sup>[826]</sup></a> and in the Medical and Physical Journal<a id='r827' /><a href='#f827' class='c013'><sup>[827]</sup></a> a third instance
will be found, which after the first twenty-four hours assumed
the form of pure gastritis, and was treated as such with success.
Blood-letting ought not to be practised till the poison is nearly all
discharged from the stomach, because it promotes absorption by
causing emptiness of the blood-vessels.</p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila has lately advocated the use of blood-letting, on the ground
that it tends to remove from the system a portion of the poison which
circulates with the blood, and is the main source of danger to life.
He has endeavoured to show by experiments on animals, that doses
adequate to cause death may be given without this result following, if
depletion be vigorously enforced along with other treatment. And
he has related a case of recovery in the human subject under unfavourable
circumstances, where blood-letting was practised five
times, and on every occasion with marked relief.<a id='r828' /><a href='#f828' class='c013'><sup>[828]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It is not probable that any material advantage will be derived
from topical blood-letting, at least in the early stage, because if depletion
is to be of use at all, it must be carried at once to a far greater
extent than it is possible to attain by local evacuants. Blisters on
the abdomen will prove useful auxiliaries in the advanced stage.</p>

<p class='c006'>While many have advocated the employment of blood-letting and
other antiphlogistics, and have used them with apparent advantage,
Rasori was of opinion, and more recently Giacomini has strenuously
maintained that the proper treatment in all cases of arsenical poisoning
is the purely stimulant method. The remedy recommended by
the latter is a mixture of eight ounces of beef-tea and two ounces of
wine. These notions are evidently dictated by the prevailing pathological
delusions of the Italian school. Although upheld in some
measure by a Report of the Parisian Academy of Medicine upon
some experiments by M. Rognetta on this subject,<a id='r829' /><a href='#f829' class='c013'><sup>[829]</sup></a> Professor Orfila
subsequently proved, that the practice recommended is utterly useless,
if not even hurtful.<a id='r830' /><a href='#f830' class='c013'><sup>[830]</sup></a> At the same time no one who has ever
seen a case of poisoning by arsenic can doubt that it is often necessary
to counteract the overwhelming languor of the circulation by
the moderate use of stimulants.</p>

<p class='c006'>Opium in repeated doses will prove useful, when the poison has
been removed, and the inflammation subdued by blood-letting. And
I conceive that to the form of gastritis, caused by arsenic, may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>applied a method of treatment by anodynes, which has been successfully
used in acute inflammation generally,—the free administration
of opium immediately after copious depletion. For the safe employment
of this method, however, it is essential that the arsenic be
completely removed from the stomach and intestines. And from the
results of many cases there must always be great reason to apprehend,
that, before the treatment can be with propriety resorted to, the patient’s
strength will be exhausted.</p>

<p class='c006'>The harassing fits of vomiting which often continue long after the
poison has been discharged from the stomach are best removed by
opium in the form of clyster, or rubbed over the inside of the rectum
in the form of ointment with the finger.</p>

<p class='c006'>The use of laxatives is particularly required in all cases in which
there is tenesmus instead of diarrhœa, or where, in the latter stages,
diarrhœa is succeeded by constipation; and castor oil is the laxative
generally preferred. While diarrhœa is present, and the evacuations
are profuse or the intestines have been thoroughly emptied, laxatives
are unnecessary or even hurtful; but emollient clysters are advisable,
and opium in the form of enema or suppository. In short, so far as
regards the intestinal affection, the treatment of the acute stage of
dysentery is to be enforced.</p>

<p class='c006'>Professor Orfila lays great stress on the employment of diuretics
after the stomach has been cleared out, and founds this practice on
his observations which show that arsenic is absorbed into the blood,
and gradually discharged by the secretions, especially the urine.
Experience seems to confirm theory. Dogs, after receiving a small
dose, adequate to occasion death, recovered under the active administration
of diuretics. Having ascertained that this animal was
constantly killed in a period varying from thirty to forty-eight hours
by two grains applied to a wound, provided no remedies were employed,
he tried the diuretic method with six which had been thus
poisoned; and all of them recovered.<a id='r831' /><a href='#f831' class='c013'><sup>[831]</sup></a> The diuretic he recommends
is a mixture of ten pounds of water, five of white [French] wine, a
bottle of Selzer water, and three ounces of nitre; the dose of which
is two wine-glassfuls frequently.<a id='r832' /><a href='#f832' class='c013'><sup>[832]</sup></a> This method has been followed
with success in the human subject. M. Augouard relates a case
where 230 grains produced in half an hour all the usual symptoms,
which he immediately proceeded to treat by administering a grain
and a half of tartar-emetic, to excite full vomiting. Having accomplished
this object, he gave frequent doses of decoction of mallow
“strongly salpetred,” which in seven hours excited so profuse a
diuresis that in the ensuing ten hours no less than eighteen imperial
pints was discharged. At the close of this period a material amendment
took place, and recovery was complete in fifteen days.<a id='r833' /><a href='#f833' class='c013'><sup>[833]</sup></a> It
may be observed, however, that it is sometimes impossible to excite
diuresis.<a id='r834' /><a href='#f834' class='c013'><sup>[834]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>Little need be said of the practice to be pursued in the advanced
stages of poisoning with arsenic, when convalescence has begun.
The principal object is to support the system by mild nourishment,
avoiding at the same time stimulant diet of every kind, but especially
spirituous and vinous liquors. Whatever may be the difference
of results obtained with the antiphlogistic mode of cure, the opposite
system has been invariably detrimental in the advanced stage.</p>

<p class='c006'>The treatment of the nervous and dyspeptic affections, which may
supervene after the symptoms of local inflammation have ceased, is
not a fit object of review in this work, as it would lead to great
details.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING WITH MERCURY.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>The next genus of the metallic poisons includes the preparations
of mercury. Some of these are hardly less important than the arsenical
compounds. They act with equal energy, produce the same
violent symptoms, and cause death with the same rapidity. They
have therefore been often given with a criminal intent; and have
thus become the subject of inquiry upon trials. In another respect,
too, they claim the regard of the medical jurist: their effects on the
body, when insidiously introduced in the practice of the arts in which
mercury is used, form a branch of that department of medical police,
which treats of the influence of trades on the health.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section I.</span>—<i>Of the Chemical History and Tests for the preparations of Mercury.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Mercury is a fluid metal, exceedingly brilliant, of a silver-white
colour, and of the specific gravity 13·568.</p>

<p class='c006'>When heated to about 660° F. it sublimes, and on cooling it condenses
unchanged. If this experiment is made in a small glass tube,
the metal forms a white ring of brilliant globules, which may be
made to coalesce into a single large one. In this way its physical
properties may be recognised, though the quantity is exceedingly
minute.</p>

<p class='c006'>Two oxides of this metal, a protoxide and peroxide, exist in combination
with acids. A bluish-gray or grayish-black protoxide is
separated from the salts of the protoxide by the fixed alkalis. The
peroxide has an orange-red colour, and is the common red precipitate
of the apothecary. Mercury unites with sulphur in two proportions.
The proto-sulphuret, which is black, is formed from the salts
of the protoxide by the action of sulphuretted-hydrogen: the bisulphuret
is the well known pigment, cinnabar or vermilion. Mercury
likewise unites with chlorine in two proportions, forming an insoluble
protochloride and a soluble bichloride, the former calomel, the latter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>corrosive sublimate. It likewise unites with cyanogen. Mercury
also unites in the state of protoxide and peroxide with the acids.
Several compound salts are known to the chemist, but few occur in
commerce or the arts.</p>

<p class='c006'>Among the compounds resulting from the action of this metal with
other substances, those which require notice in a toxicological treatise
are the following:—1. The binoxide or <i>red precipitate</i>; 2. The
bisulphuret or <i>vermilion</i>; 3. The protochloride or <i>calomel</i>; 4. The
bichloride or <i>corrosive sublimate</i>; 5. The sulphate or <i>Turbith mineral</i>;
6. The <i>bicyanide</i> or prussiate of mercury; and 7. The <i>nitrates</i> of
mercury. Its other compounds are of little consequence to the toxicologist.</p>

<h5 class='c011'>1. <i>Of Red Precipitate.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>Red precipitate, when well prepared, is in the form of fine powder
or small, brilliant, heavy scales of a scarlet or orange colour.
It consists of 101 mercury and 8 oxygen. It is insoluble in water.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is easily distinguished from all other substances by the action of
heat. If a little of it is heated in a small glass tube, it becomes dark
brown, and on cooling recovers its original colour. But if the heat
be raised higher, metallic globules are sublimed, and oxygen gas is
disengaged. The escape of oxygen may be ascertained by plunging
to the bottom a small bit of burning wood, when the combustion will
be observed to be enlivened.</p>

<h5 class='c011'>2. <i>Of Cinnabar.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>Cinnabar or vermilion, the bisulphuret of mercury, usually exists
in the arts in the form of a fine, heavy, red powder, of a peculiar tint,
which is termed from this substance vermilion-red. In mass its structure
is coarsely-fibrous, and its colour reddish-brown; and it has some
lustre. When thrown down from a solution of corrosive sublimate
by sulphuretted-hydrogen, or the alkaline hydrosulphates, it forms a
black powder, which acquires a red tint by being sublimed. It is
composed of 101 metal and 16 sulphur.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is distinguished from other substances by the operation of heat,
and by the effects of reduction with iron filings. Heated alone in a
tube it sublimes without change. Its colour, indeed, which is fugacious
under heat unless particular manipulations are used, becomes
darker and dingy; but its lustre and crystalline texture are retained.
Heated with iron filings in a tube, it gives off globules of mercury;
and the existence of sulphuret of iron in what remains may be proved
by the escape of sulphuretted-hydrogen on the addition of diluted
sulphuric acid.</p>

<h5 class='c011'>3. <i>Of Turbith Mineral.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>The Turbith mineral, or subsulphate of the binoxide of mercury,
exists in the form of a bright lemon-yellow, heavy powder. It is soluble
in 2000 parts of water, and has an acrid taste.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>It may be known by the effects of heat. When heated in a tube,
globules of mercury are sublimed, and at the same time sulphurous
acid gas is disengaged, as may be ascertained by the smell. But a
better method of proving the existence of sulphuric acid in it is to
expose it to the action of a solution of caustic potass: The potass
separates from it the brownish-yellow peroxide, and appropriates the
sulphuric acid, which may be found in the solution by acidulating
with nitric acid, and then adding hydrochlorate of baryta, when a
heavy, snow-white precipitate of sulphate of baryta will form. The
nitric acid used in this process must be quite pure, and free of sulphuric
acid, which the acid of commerce often contains.</p>

<h5 class='c011'>4. <i>Of Calomel.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>Calomel (muriate, mild muriate, chloride, protochloride of mercury),
is commonly met with in the shops in the form of a heavy powder,
having a faint yellowish-white colour, and no taste or smell.
In mass it forms compact, fibrous, translucent, shining cakes of great
density. It is insoluble in water.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is distinguished by the effects of heat, and those of the solution
of caustic potass. Heated in a tube it sublimes unchanged, and condenses
in a crystalline or crumbly mass. The solution of caustic potass
or soda turns it at once black, disengaging protoxide of mercury
and acquiring hydrochloric acid, the presence of which is proved by
neutralizing the solution with nitric acid, and adding nitrate of silver,
when a heavy white precipitate is formed, the chloride of silver. In
applying this process, care must be taken to employ potass quite free
of muriates, and nitric acid free of muriatic acid. Ammonia also
renders calomel powder black, but the action and product are much
more complex in their nature.</p>

<h5 class='c011'>5. <i>Of Corrosive Sublimate.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>Corrosive sublimate (oxymuriate, corrosive muriate, bichloride of
mercury), is by far the most important of the mercurial poisons, as it
is both the most active of them, and the one most frequently used for
criminal purposes. It is commonly met with in the form of a heavy,
snow-white powder, or of small, broken crystals, or in white, compact,
concave, crystalline cakes. It is permanent in the air; but in
the sunshine is slowly decomposed, a gray insoluble powder being
formed. It readily crystallizes, and the common form of the crystals
is the quadrangular prism. Its specific gravity is 5·2. Its taste is
strongly styptic, metallic, acrid, and persistent; and its dust powerfully
irritates the nostrils. It is soluble, according to Thenard, in 20,
according to Orfila, in 11 parts of temperate water, and in thrice its
weight of boiling water. Its solution faintly reddens litmus. It is
more soluble in alcohol than in water, boiling alcohol dissolving its
own weight, and retaining when it cools, a fourth part. It is also
very soluble in ether, so that ether will remove it from its aqueous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>solution. Corrosive sublimate may become the subject of a medico-legal
analysis in three states. It may be in the solid form; it may
be dissolved in water along with other mineral substances; and it
may be mixed with vegetable and animal fluids or solids.</p>

<h6 class='c011'><i>Of the Tests for Corrosive Sublimate in the solid state.</i></h6>

<p class='c012'>Corrosive sublimate in the solid state is distinguished from other
substances by the action of the heat, and the effects of solution of
caustic potass. Subjected to heat alone it sublimes in white acrid
fumes; and if the experiment is made in a little tube, it condenses
again unaltered in a crystalline cake. Treated with solution of caustic
potass, it becomes yellow, the binoxide being disengaged, and
hydrochloric acid uniting with the potass, as may be proved by nitrate
of silver, after filtration and neutralization with nitric acid.
The yellow colour of the binoxide which is separated in this process
distinguishes corrosive sublimate from calomel, which is also decomposed
by the potass solution, but yields a black protoxide. Caustic
soda has the same effect. Not so caustic ammonia: Ammonia
blackens calomel, but does not change the colour of corrosive sublimate,
as it forms with it a white triple salt, commonly called white
precipitate.</p>

<p class='c006'>The process here described is the best and simplest method of determining
chemically the nature of corrosive sublimate in its solid
state. But two other tests may also be mentioned, as they have been
a good deal used. A very good test is the process of reduction with
potass, by which globules of mercury are sublimed, and a chloride of
potassium left in the flux, as may be proved by the action of nitrate
of silver on the solution of the flux previously neutralized with nitric
acid. This test alone will not distinguish corrosive sublimate from
calomel: The solubility of the former must be taken into account.—Another
satisfactory test is the solution of protochloride of tin. Corrosive
sublimate, when left for some time in this solution, first becomes
grayish-black, and ere long its place is supplied by globules
of mercury,—the chlorine being entirely abstracted by the protochloride
of tin, which consequently passes to the state of a bichloride.
Calomel is similarly affected.</p>

<h6 class='c011'><i>Of the Tests for Corrosive Sublimate in a state of Solution.</i></h6>

<p class='c012'>Two processes may be mentioned for the detection of corrosive
sublimate in mineral solutions,—a process by reduction, and a process
by liquid tests.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Reduction process.</i>—In order to procure mercury in its characteristic
metallic state from a solution of corrosive sublimate, the following
plan of procedure will be found the most delicate and convenient.
Add to the solution, previously acidulated with hydrochloric acid if
very weak, a little of the protochloride of tin, which will be seen
presently to be a liquid reagent of great delicacy. If the solution is
not darkened there is not present an appreciable quantity of mercury.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>If mercury is present a bluish-gray or grayish-black precipitate falls
down, owing to the chemical action already particularized. After
ebullition, this precipitate is to be allowed to subside, first in a tall
glass vessel suited to the quantity of the solution, and afterwards in
the small glass tube, Fig. 7, the superincumbent fluid being previously
decanted off as far as possible. After it has subsided in the
tube, the remaining fluid is withdrawn with the pipette, Fig. 8;
water is poured over it; and this is withdrawn again after the precipitate
has subsided a third time. The bottom of the tube is then cut
off with a file, and the moisture which remains is driven off with a
gentle heat. When this is accomplished, the powder, which is nothing
else than metallic mercury, sometimes runs into globules. Should it
not do so, the bit of tube is to be broken in pieces and heated in
the tube, Fig. 1, when a brilliant ring of fine globules will be formed.
If the globules are too minute to be visible to the naked eye, the
tube is to be cut off with the file close to the ring; and the globules
may then be easily made to coalesce into one or more of visible
magnitude by scraping the inside of the tube with the point of a penknife.</p>

<p class='c006'>This process is not recommended as preferable to the plan by
liquid reagents which is next to be mentioned, and which is both more
easily put in practice, and at the same time quite as satisfactory. It
is related chiefly because it forms the ground-work of a process for
detecting mercury in mixed animal or vegetable fluids. It will be
remarked that the process does not prove with what acid the mercury
was combined in the solution. But this is a defect of little consequence;
for the only other soluble salts of mercury ever met
with in the arts, namely, the nitrate, acetate, and cyanide, are too
rare to be the source of any material fallacy; and are besides all
equally poisonous with corrosive sublimate.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Process by Liquid Tests.</i>—The process by liquid reagents consists
in the application of several tests to separate portions of the solution.
The tests which appear to me the most satisfactory are hydrosulphuric
acid gas, hydriodate of potass, protochloride of tin, and nitrate of
silver.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <i>Hydrosulphuric acid gas</i> transmitted in a stream through a solution
of corrosive sublimate causes a dark, brownish-black precipitate,
the bisulphuret of mercury. When the solution is not very diluted,
the gas forms a whitish or yellowish precipitate before the blackening
commences,—an effect which, according to Pfaff, distinguishes the
salts of the peroxide of mercury from all other metals that are thrown
down black from their solutions by sulphuretted-hydrogen.<a id='r835' /><a href='#f835' class='c013'><sup>[835]</sup></a> The
cause of this is that the particles of sulphuret first formed acquire a
thin covering of corrosive sublimate by that property which chemists
of late have termed superficial attraction. Hydrosulphuric acid is
a very delicate test of the presence of mercury. It will detect corrosive
sublimate, where its proportion is only a 35000th of the solution.<a id='r836' /><a href='#f836' class='c013'><sup>[836]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>This test is not alone sufficient, unless reliance be placed on
Pfaff’s criterion, which is rather a trivial one; for hydrosulphuric
acid occasions a black precipitate in other metallic solutions, for example,
in solutions of lead, copper, bismuth and silver. In mixed
organic fluids its action is not liable to be prevented; but the precipitate
formed is often kept intimately suspended, as in the instance of
milk. It may be conveniently used in the form of hydrosulphate of
ammonia. This test produces a dark-brown precipitate, which is
said to pass slowly to a bright cinnabar red; but I have not been
able to observe any transformation of the kind.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Hydriodate of Potass</i> causes in solutions of corrosive sublimate a
beautiful pale scarlet precipitate, which rapidly deepens in tint.
The precipitate is the biniodide of mercury. This is a test of great
delicacy when skilfully used, as it acts where the salt forms only a
7000th of the solution (Devergie). Care must be taken, however,
not to add too much of the test, because the precipitate is soluble
in an excess of the hydriodate, or too little, because the precipitate
is also soluble in a considerable excess of corrosive sublimate.</p>

<p class='c006'>The action of hydriodate of potass is not liable to any important
ambiguity: no other iodide resembles in colour the biniodide of mercury.
It is not a certain test, however, when other salts exist in solution
along with corrosive sublimate. Chloride of sodium, nitrate
of potass, and probably also other neutral salts possess the power
of dissolving the precipitate. Sulphuric and nitric acids, even considerably
diluted, oxidate and dissolve the mercury, and disengage
iodine, which colours the fluid reddish-brown. When corrosive
sublimate is dissolved in coloured vegetable infusions or animal
fluids, the hydriodate of potass cannot be relied on, the colour of the
precipitate being altered, as in infusion of galls, or the action of the
test being suspended altogether, as by milk.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Protochloride of Tin</i> causes first a white precipitate, which, when
more of the test is added, gives place to a grayish-black one. In
very diluted solutions the colour struck is grayish or grayish-black
from the beginning. In such solutions Devergie has found it useful
to acidulate with hydrochloric acid before adding the test. The
chemical action here is peculiar. The white powder thrown down
at first is protochloride of mercury; a part of the chlorine of the bichloride
of mercury having been abstracted by the protochloride of
tin, which becomes in consequence the bichloride. On more of the
test being added these changes are repeated, the chlorine is removed
from the protochloride of mercury, and metallic mercury falls
down. This test is one of extreme delicacy, affecting solutions
which contain only an 80,000th of salt. It is prepared by acting on
tin powder or tinfoil with strong hydrochloric acid aided by a gentle
heat. The solution must be kept carefully excluded from the air; otherwise
bichloride of tin is formed, which does not act at all on the solution
of corrosive sublimate.</p>

<p class='c006'>The protochloride of tin is not liable to any fallacy. Neither is it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>liable to be suspended in its action by the co-existence of other
saline substances. It causes precipitates with almost all animal and
most vegetable fluids. But when corrosive sublimate is present,
even in very small proportion, the precipitate is always darker than
when no mercurial salt exists in solution, and frequently has its
proper grayish-black tint. This property, as will presently be seen,
is the foundation of a process for the detection of mercury in all states
of admixture with organic matters.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Nitrate of Silver</i> causes a heavy white precipitate, the chloride of
silver, which darkens under exposure to light. This is a test for the
chlorine of the corrosive sublimate, but not for the mercury, and is a
necessary addition to the three former tests in order to determine how
the mercury is kept in solution. It acts with very great delicacy.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is of no use, however, when chlorine or hydrochloric acid is
present either free or combined with other bases. It is not of use,
therefore, in animal fluids and vegetable infusions, because very
many of them, besides organic principles which form white precipitates
with this test, contain a sensible proportion of hydrochlorate
of soda.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although the preceding liquid reagents when employed conjunctly
are amply sufficient for determining the presence of corrosive sublimate
in a fluid, many other tests hardly less characteristic and delicate
have been used by medical jurists. These will now be shortly
mentioned.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <i>Lime-Water</i> throws down the binoxide of mercury in the form
of a heavy yellow powder. The precipitate first thrown down is
lemon-yellow, an additional quantity of the test gives it a reddish-yellow
tint, and a still larger quantity restores the lemon-yellow.
This test is characteristic, but not so delicate as those already mentioned.—2.
<i>Caustic Potass</i> has precisely the same effect as lime-water,
except that the tint of the precipitate is always yellow—3.
<i>Caustic Ammonia</i> causes a fine, white, flocculent precipitate of intricate
composition, commonly called precipitate. It is a very delicate
test; but ammonia likewise causes a white precipitate in other metallic
solutions.—4. <i>Carbonate of Potass</i> causes a brisk-red precipitate,
by virtue of a double decomposition, the precipitate being carbonate
of mercury.—5. The <i>Ferro-cyanate of Potass</i> causes at first a white
precipitate, the ferro-cyanide of mercury. The precipitate becomes
slowly yellowish, and at length pale-blue, owing, it is believed, to the
admixture of a small quantity of iron with the corrosive sublimate.—6.
<i>A polished plate of Copper</i> immersed in a solution of corrosive
sublimate becomes in a few seconds tarnished and brownish; and in
the course of half an hour a grayish-white powder is formed on its
surface. This powder, according to Orfila,<a id='r837' /><a href='#f837' class='c013'><sup>[837]</sup></a> is a mixture of calomel,
mercury, and a copper amalgam. If it is wiped off, and the plate
then rubbed briskly where tarnished, it assumes a white argentine
appearance.—7. <i>A little Mercury</i> put into a solution of corrosive
sublimate is instantly tarnished on the surface; the solution in a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>seconds becomes turbid, a heavy grayish precipitate is formed, and
in no long time with the aid of agitation the whole corrosive sublimate
is removed from the solution. The powdery precipitate is a
mixture of finely divided mercury and calomel; the former being
derived from the surface of the mercury, and the latter produced by
the corrosive sublimate uniting with a larger proportion of the metal
to form the protochloride.—8. <i>A solution of Albumen</i> causes a white
precipitate, which is soluble in a considerable excess of the reagent.
The nature of this precipitate will be discussed presently.—A <i>slip
of Gold</i> aided by galvanism, becomes silver-white in the solution,
in consequence of the formation of an amalgam. When the solution
is concentrated, it may be thus tested by simply putting a few drops
on a bit of gold, and touching the gold through the solution with an
iron point, as recommended by Mr. Sylvester and Dr. Paris.<a id='r838' /><a href='#f838' class='c013'><sup>[838]</sup></a> When
the solution is very weak, a different method is necessary, and a process
for the purpose has been proposed by M. Devergie, which appears
so delicate, accurate, and at the same time simple, a mode of
detecting traces of mercury in very weak solutions, as to deserve
detailed notice. A thin plate of gold, and another of tin, a few lines
broad, and two or three inches long, being closely applied to one
another by silk threads at the ends, and then twisted spirally, this
galvanic pile is left for twenty-four or thirty-six hours in the solution
previously acidulated with muriatic acid; upon which the gold is
found whitened, and mercury may be obtained in globules by heating
the gold in a tube. Distinct indications may be obtained by this
method, where the corrosive sublimate forms but an 80,000th of the
water.<a id='r839' /><a href='#f839' class='c013'><sup>[839]</sup></a> For facility of application, an important condition is, that
the quantity of fluid should not exceed three or four ounces, because
in a larger quantity the pile of the size stated above cannot remove
the whole mercury. Somewhat similar to this is the galvanic method
of Mr. Davy of Dublin. He proposes to place the suspected solution
in a platinum crucible with hydrochloric acid, diluted with its own
weight of water, to excite galvanic action by immersing in the fluid
a plate of zinc, and to sublime and collect the reduced mercury, by
washing the crucible, heating it over a spirit-lamp, and condensing
the mercurial vapours on a plate of glass placed over the mouth of
the crucible.<a id='r840' /><a href='#f840' class='c013'><sup>[840]</sup></a></p>

<h6 class='c011'><i>Of the Tests for Corrosive Sublimate when mixed with Organic Fluids and Solids.</i></h6>

<p class='c012'>The process for detecting corrosive sublimate in mixtures of organic
fluids and solids, such as the contents of the stomach, is now
to be described. But some remarks are previously required on the
chemical relations subsisting between this poison and various principles
of the vegetable and animal kingdoms.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>These relations are important in a medico-legal point of view on
several grounds. On the one hand, the chemical changes which
corrosive sublimate undergoes often alter so much the action of its
tests, as to render necessary a process of analysis materially different
from any hitherto described. And on the other hand, these chemical
changes, of which some take place rapidly, others slowly, will hinder
the corrosive sublimate, more or less completely, from exerting its
usual operation on the animal system; so that it may thus either
accidentally fail to act as intended, or be checked in its operation by
antidotes administered for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>It appears from the researches of M. Boullay, confirmed by those
of Professor Orfila, that various vegetable fluids, extracts, fixed oils,
volatile oils and resins, possess the power of decomposing corrosive
sublimate. According to M. Boullay, a part of the chlorine is gradually
disengaged in the form of hydrochloric acid, and the salt is
consequently converted into calomel, which is deposited in a state of
mixture or combination with vegetable matter.<a id='r841' /><a href='#f841' class='c013'><sup>[841]</sup></a> Some vegetable
fluids produce this change at once, others not for some hours, others
not for days, and only when aided by a temperature approaching
ebullition. For example, a strong infusion of tea, mixed with a solution
of a few grains of corrosive sublimate, becomes immediately
muddy, and an insoluble cloud separates in half an hour. But
the remaining fluid slowly becomes muddy again, and in eight days
a considerable precipitate is formed. Both precipitates contain mercury;
the former, I find, contains 31 per cent. On the other hand,
an infusion of galls in like circumstances does not become muddy
for six or seven hours. A solution of sugar does not undergo any
change after being mixed with a solution of corrosive sublimate for
months at the ordinary temperature of the atmosphere; but at the
temperature of ebullition Boullay has found that the usual changes
ensue, though to no great extent.</p>

<p class='c006'>The experiments of Professor Taddei of Florence have farther
shown, that the property of decomposing corrosive sublimate is possessed
in an eminent degree by one of the vegetable solids, gluten.
If the salt in solution is properly mixed with a due proportion of
gluten of wheat, that is, about four times its weight, the water will be
found no longer to contain any mercury, while the gluten becomes
whitish, brittle, hard, and not prone to putrefaction. A ternary compound
is formed, the protochloride of mercury and gluten.<a id='r842' /><a href='#f842' class='c013'><sup>[842]</sup></a> This
change is effected with rapidity.</p>

<p class='c006'>The researches of Berthollet,<a id='r843' /><a href='#f843' class='c013'><sup>[843]</sup></a> repeated and extended by Professor
Orfila,<a id='r844' /><a href='#f844' class='c013'><sup>[844]</sup></a> have also shown that the same property is possessed by most
animal fluids and solids. Among the soluble animal principles, albumen,
caesin, osmazôme, and gelatin possess it in a high degree,
but above all albumen, the action of which has been examined with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>some care, as it supplies the physician with the most convenient and
effectual antidote against the effects of the poison.</p>

<p class='c006'>If a solution of albumen, for example that procured by beating
white of eggs in water, is dropped by degrees into a solution of corrosive
sublimate, a white flaky precipitate is immediately thrown
down, which when separated and dried forms horny masses, hard,
brittle, and pulverizable. The precipitate is soluble in a considerable
excess of albumen; so that wherever albumen abounds in any
fluid, to which corrosive sublimate has been added, a portion of the
mercury will always be found in solution. The precipitate is
also soluble in a considerable excess of corrosive sublimate. The
dry precipitate I have found to contain 6 per cent. of metallic mercury.</p>

<p class='c006'>The action of casein as it exists in milk is precisely the same. A
solution of corrosive sublimate, poured into a large quantity of milk,
causes no change; but if the proportion of salt be considerable, a
flaky coagulum is formed, and the milk becomes clear. The principles,
osmazôme and gelatin, are similar in their effects, though not
quite so powerful. Urea has no chemical action with corrosive sublimate.
Of the compound animal fluids, blood and serum have the
same effects as albumen.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many insoluble animal principles, as well as all the soft solids of
the animal body, act in the same manner with vegetable gluten. Fibrin,
for example, coagulated albumen, or coagulated casein, acts
precisely in the same way. Muscular fibre, the mucous and serous
membranes, the fibrous textures, and the brain, have all the same effect:
they become firmer, brittle, white, and a white powder detaches
itself from their surface, which contains mercury and animal
matter. This chemical action, which Taddei has proved to take
place in the living<a id='r845' /><a href='#f845' class='c013'><sup>[845]</sup></a> as well as in the dead body, is the source of the
corrosive property of the poison, as was first pointed out by Berthollet
in his essay formerly quoted.</p>

<p class='c006'>In all of the compounds thus formed by vegetable and animal substances,
the presence of mercury is easily proved by boiling the
powder in a solution of caustic potass. The organized matter is dissolved;
a heavy, grayish-black powder is formed, which is protoxide
of mercury; and if this be collected in the way formerly described, it
forms running quicksilver when heated.</p>

<p class='c006'>A difference of opinion prevails as to the nature of the changes
effected by the mutual action of corrosive sublimate and organic
matter. For example, in the instance of the action of albumen, which
has been most carefully examined, Berzelius and Lassaigne<a id='r846' /><a href='#f846' class='c013'><sup>[846]</sup></a> regard
the precipitate as a compound of bichloride of mercury with albumen.
Professor Rose and Dr. Geoghegan<a id='r847' /><a href='#f847' class='c013'><sup>[847]</sup></a> have proved it, in their opinion,
to be a compound of binoxide of mercury and albumen without
any chlorine. And according to Boullay it is composed of albumen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>in union with calomel.<a id='r848' /><a href='#f848' class='c013'><sup>[848]</sup></a> Lassaigne says he has found it to be a
compound of ten equivalents of albumen with one of mercury, or
93·33 per cent. of the former, and 6·67 of the latter.<a id='r849' /><a href='#f849' class='c013'><sup>[849]</sup></a> The compound
with fibrin he considers to be analogous in composition.</p>

<p class='c006'>With regard to the changes induced by these effects of organized
matter on the operation of the liquid tests for corrosive sublimate, it
will in the first place be manifest that the poison may thus be wholly
removed from their sphere of action: it may be thrown down as an
insoluble substance, on which any process by liquid tests hitherto
mentioned will of course fail to act. But secondly, even when a
moderate quantity does remain in solution, the operation of the liquid
tests, as formerly noticed under the head of each, will be materially
modified. It is of some moment for the medical jurist to remember,
that by reason of the slowness with which the changes in question
sometimes takes place, the poison may exist abundantly in solution
at one time, and yet be present only in small quantity after an interval
of some hours or days.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Process for Organic Mixtures.</i>—Various processes have been proposed
for detecting corrosive sublimate in organic mixtures. The
first I shall mention is one proposed by myself in former editions of
this work. It is a double one; of which sometimes the first part,
sometimes the second, sometimes both may be required. The first
removes the corrosive sublimate undecomposed from the mixture,
which may be accomplished when its proportion is considerable;
the second, when the proportion of corrosive sublimate is too small
to admit of being so removed, separates from the mixture metallic
mercury; and the analyst will know which of the two to employ by
using the protochloride of tin as a trial-test in the following manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>A fluid mixture being in the first instance made, if necessary, by
dividing and bruising all soft solids into very small fragments, and
boiling the mass in distilled water, a small portion is to be filtered
for the trial. If the protochloride of tin causes a pretty deep ash-gray
or grayish-black colour, the first process may prove successful;
if the shade acquired is not deep, that process may be neglected,
and the second put in practice at once.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>First branch of the Process.</i>—In order to remove the corrosive
sublimate undecomposed, the mixture, without filtration, is to be
agitated for a few minutes with about a fourth part of its volume of
sulphuric ether; which possesses the property of abstracting the salt
from its aqueous solution. On remaining at rest for half a minute or
a little more, the etherial solution rises to the surface, and may then
be removed by suction with the pipette (Fig. 8). It is next to be
filtered if requisite, evaporated to dryness, and the residue treated
with boiling water; upon which a solution is procured that will present
the properties formerly mentioned as belonging to corrosive sublimate
in its dissolved state. This branch of the process is derived
from one of Orfila’s methods.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Second branch of the Process.</i>—If the preceding method should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>fail, or shall have been judged inapplicable, as will very generally be
the case, the mixture is to be treated in the following manner. In
the first place, all particles of seeds, leaves, and other fibrous matter
of a vegetable nature, are to be removed as carefully as possible.
This being done, the mixture, without undergoing filtration, is to be
treated with protochloride of tin as long as any precipitate or coagulum
is formed. If there were solid animal matters in the mixture, besides
being cut and carefully bruised as directed above, they should also
be brought thoroughly in contact with the salt of tin by trituration.
The mixture, even if it contains but a very minute proportion of
mercury, will acquire a slate-gray tint, and become easily separable
into a liquid and coagulum. The coagulum is to be collected, washed
and drained on a filter; from which it is then to be removed without
being dried; and care should be taken not to tear away with it any
fibres of the paper, as these would obstruct the succeeding operations.
The mercury exists in it in the metallic state for reasons
formerly mentioned.</p>

<p class='c006'>The precipitate is next to be boiled in a moderately strong solution
of caustic potass contained in a glass flask, or still better in a
smooth porcelain vessel glazed with porcelain; and the ebullition is
to be continued till all the lumps disappear. The animal and vegetable
matter, and oxide of tin united with them, will thus be dissolved;
and on the solution being allowed to remain at rest, a heavy grayish-black
powder will begin to fall down in a few seconds. This is
chiefly metallic mercury, of which, indeed, globules may sometimes
be discerned with the naked eye or with a small magnifier.</p>

<p class='c006'>In order to separate it, leave the solution at rest under a temperature
a little short of ebullition for fifteen or twenty minutes, or longer,
if necessary. Fill up the vessel gently with hot water without disturbing
the precipitate, so that a fatty matter, which rises to the surface
in the case of most animal mixtures, may be skimmed off first
with a spoon, and afterwards with filtering paper. Then withdraw
the whole supernatant fluid, which is easily done on account of the
great density of the black powder. Transfer the powder into a small
glass tube, and wash it by the process of affusion and subsidence till
the washings do not taste alkaline. Any fibrous matter which may
have escaped notice at the commencement of the process, and any
lumpy matter which may have escaped solution by the potass, should
now be picked out. The black powder is the only part which should
be preserved. If the quantity of powder is very minute, an interval
of twelve hours should be allowed for each subsidence, and the tube
represented in Fig. 7 should be used.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lastly, the powder is to be removed, heated, and sublimed, as in
the last stage of the process described in page <a href='#Page_293'>293</a>, for detecting corrosive
sublimate in a pure solution.</p>

<p class='c006'>The second branch of this process is very delicate. I have detected
by it a quarter of a grain of corrosive sublimate mixed with
two ounces of beef, or with five ounces of new milk, or porter, or
tea made with a liberal allowance of cream and sugar. I have also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>detected a tenth part of a grain in four ounces of the last mixture,
that is in 19,200 times its weight.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be applied successfully and without difficulty to a very
large majority of medico-legal cases. The only difficulty in the way
of applying it to all organic mixtures whatever arises from the occasional
presence of some vegetable matters, such as seeds, leaves,
ligneous fibre and the like, which are insoluble in caustic potass,
and which may therefore be left behind with the mercurial precipitate,
and obstruct the subsequent sublimation of the metal. This
difficulty may be sometimes got rid of, as recommended above, by
picking such matters out of the mixture before the protochloride of
tin is added. No mercury is lost by so doing, for none of it is
united with these vegetable matters: corrosive sublimate does not
form any chemical compound with them as it does with other vegetable
matters soluble in caustic potass, and with the soft animal
solids. When the particles are too small to admit of being thus
removed, or cannot be afterwards removed during the process of
washing the black powder, which is left after the action of potass—the
analyst must be content with the increased facility of sublimation
derived from the abstraction of other vegetable and animal admixtures,
and take care to use a tube of greater length and with a
larger ball than usual. If the sublimate is too much obscured by
empyreumatized matter to exhibit distinctly its metallic, globular
appearance, the portion of the tube is to be broken off, and scraped,
washed, and boiled with a little rectified spirit in a tube. If the
globules do not then become visible, a second sublimation will render
them distinct. This supplemental operation, however, will be very
seldom required; and the process given above will be found to apply
to a great majority of instances.</p>

<p class='c006'>Various objections brought against this process by reviewers and
others were noticed in previous editions of this work. The result of
the investigation is, that, though not by any means a perfect process,
it is one of the most convenient and certain, and least fallacious of
all yet proposed. The first step for separating corrosive sublimate
by ether in the undecomposed state,—which is borrowed from a
suggestion of Professor Orfila, will seldom succeed; for the poison
is seldom present in sufficient quantity.</p>

<p class='c006'>It must be observed that this as well as every other method yet
proposed for discovering corrosive sublimate in compound mixtures
merely indicates the presence of mercury, and does not point out its
state of combination. More especially, in the case of the contents
of the stomach, if mercury be not obtained from the filtered fluid, it
is impossible to know whether what is detected in the solid matter
only may not have proceeded from calomel given medicinally. This
objection can be obviated solely by sufficient evidence that calomel
was not administered; at least the different criterions laid down by
Professor Orfila for distinguishing calomel in the alimentary canal
from the products of the decomposition of corrosive sublimate do not
appear sufficiently precise, or commonly applicable.<a id='r850' /><a href='#f850' class='c013'><sup>[850]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>Various processes for detecting corrosive sublimate in organic
mixtures have been proposed by others. But none of these seem
to me preferable to the method detailed above, with the exception
of one which has been lately proposed by Professor Orfila, and which
is particularly deserving of notice, because, although complex, he
has found it sufficiently manageable and delicate for detecting mercury
in the animal textures and secretions, into which it has obtained
admission through the medium of absorption in cases of poisoning
with the compounds of mercury. Like the previous process, however,
it merely detects mercury, and cannot point out the state of
combination in which mercury was administered, or mixed with the
substance examined.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the suspected matter be sufficiently liquid, boil for a few minutes
and filter; acidulate the product with a few drops of hydrochloric
acid; and immerse some slips of copper-leaf in it for a few hours.
Should they be tarnished, dissolve oxide and chloride of copper from
the surface by means of ammonia; wash them and press them between
folds of filtering paper; cut them in pieces, and heat these in a glass
tube. Globules of mercury may be obtained or not. In either case,
let the liquid, in which the plates were first immersed, be evaporated
to dryness over the vapour-bath; add to the residue a sixth of sulphuric
acid in a retort with a receiver; and heat gently till a nearly
dry carbonaceous mass be obtained. Boil this with an ounce and a
half of nitro-hydrochloric acid [Edin. Pharm.], until the charcoal be
again nearly dry. Heat what remains with boiling distilled water,
filter, apply to a small part of the liquid the copper test as just described,
and try whether corrosive sublimate can be detached from
the remainder by means of sulphuric ether (p. <a href='#Page_299'>299</a>). The distilled
fluid in the receiver may contain corrosive sublimate in considerable
proportion, relatively to what existed in the subject of analysis. In
order to discover it, boil the liquid for fifteen minutes with nitro-hydrochloric
acid; transmit chlorine gas for an hour, filter, and evaporate
to dryness over the vapour-bath; dissolve the residue in water,
and search for corrosive sublimate both by copper plates, and by
agitation with ether.</p>

<p class='c006'>If mercury be not thus detected, proceed to the solid matter left
on the filter, by which the subject of analysis was in the first instance
separated into a liquid and solid part. Examine this by evaporation
to dryness over the vapour-bath, and charring with sulphuric acid in
a retort with a receiver attached; and then subject the product to
the same steps as those detailed above for the dried residuum of the
liquid part.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the materials for analysis be soft solids, especially the stomach,
intestines, liver, and the like, commence at once with the process of
charring with sulphuric acid. In the case of the urine, examine both
the liquid and sediment. Filter the liquid, transmit chlorine to
excess, let the product rest twenty-four hours, filter, evaporate to
dryness, dissolve the residue in water acidulated with hydrochloric
acid, and test the solution both with copper-leaf and by agitation
with ether. Heat the sediment with nitro-hydrochloric acid as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>directed above, and then proceed as with the liquid portion of the
urine.<a id='r851' /><a href='#f851' class='c013'><sup>[851]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Some other processes, but probably inferior to that of Professor
Orfila, will be found in the last edition of this work. It seems unnecessary
to reproduce them here.</p>

<h5 class='c011'>6. <i>Of Bicyanide of Mercury.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>The bicyanide of mercury is a compound of mercury and cyanogen.
It is usually sold in the form of white, opaque, heavy, crystals, which
are rhomboidal prisms. It has a disagreeable, corrosive, metallic
taste. It is easily known from every other substance by the effects
of heat. If a small quantity of it, previously well dried, be introduced
into a glass phial to which a small tube is fitted by means of
a cork, on the application of heat the salt becomes black; mercury
is sublimed, and condenses in globules on the upper part of the
phial; and a gas escapes, which has the odour of prussic acid, and
burns with a beautiful rose-red flame.</p>

<h5 class='c011'>7. <i>Of the Nitrates of Mercury.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>The nitrates of mercury are used in some of the arts, but have so
rarely been the cause of injury to man that they are of little medico-legal
importance. I am acquainted with only one case of poisoning
with them.<a id='r852' /><a href='#f852' class='c013'><sup>[852]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>There are two nitrates, the protonitrate and pernitrate. 1. The
protonitrate is in transparent colourless crystals, entirely soluble in
water with the aid of a slight excess of nitric acid; and the solution
is precipitated black by the alkalis, black by sulphuretted-hydrogen,
white by muriatic acid, and yellow by hydriodate of potass. The
crystals when heated discharge fumes of nitrous acid, and when the
whole acid is driven off the red oxide is left, which by farther heat
is converted into metallic mercury. 2. The pernitrate is similarly
affected by heat. Its crystals form white or yellowish needles.
Water decomposes them, separating an insoluble yellowish subnitrate,
and dissolving a supernitrate, which is precipitated yellow by the
alkalis, black by sulphuretted-hydrogen, carmine-red by the hydriodate
of potass. Copper separates mercury from both nitrates; and
so does gold or platinum when aided by a galvanic current.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section II.</span>—<i>Of the mode of Action of Mercury and the Symptoms it excites in Man.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The effects of mercury on the animal body are more diversified
than those of any other poison. It acts on a great number of important
organs, and in consequence the phenomena of its action are
proportionately various. It is not surprising, therefore, that some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>ambiguity still prevails as to its mode of action and the circumstances
by which the action is regulated.</p>

<p class='c006'>The attention of toxicologists in their physiological researches has
been chiefly turned to the more active preparations of mercury, and
especially to corrosive sublimate, when given in such quantity as to
prove fatal in a few days at farthest. The more immediate and
prominent properties of corrosive sublimate have consequently received
some elucidation. But its qualities as a slow poison, as well
as the analogous operation of the less active compounds of mercury,
have not been experimentally examined with the same care: indeed
it is questionable whether the phenomena of the latter description as
they occur in man can be studied with much advantage by means of
experiments on animals.—In treating of the mode in which the
compounds of mercury act, the most convenient method will be to
consider at present its action in the form of corrosive sublimate in
large doses as ascertained by late experiments, and to reserve the
consideration of the general action of mercurial poisons at large till
their effects on man have been fully described.</p>

<p class='c006'>The mode of action of corrosive sublimate has been examined
particularly by Sir B. Brodie in 1812;<a id='r853' /><a href='#f853' class='c013'><sup>[853]</sup></a> by Dr. Campbell in 1813,<a id='r854' /><a href='#f854' class='c013'><sup>[854]</sup></a>
by M. Smith in 1815,<a id='r855' /><a href='#f855' class='c013'><sup>[855]</sup></a> by M. Gaspard in 1821,<a id='r856' /><a href='#f856' class='c013'><sup>[856]</sup></a> and more lately by
Professor Orfila.<a id='r857' /><a href='#f857' class='c013'><sup>[857]</sup></a> The following is a short analysis of their experiments
and results.</p>

<p class='c006'>The leading phenomena remarked by Sir B. Brodie, on large doses
being introduced into the stomach, were very rapid death, corrosion
of the stomach, and paralysis of the heart. In rabbits and cats, from
six to twenty grains, injected in a state of solution into the stomach,
produced in a few minutes insensibility and laborious breathing, then
convulsions, and death immediately afterwards,—the whole duration
of the poisoning varying from five to twenty-five minutes. After
death the inner membrane of the stomach was gray, brittle, and here
and there pulpy,—changes precisely the same with those produced
by corrosive sublimate on the dead stomach. When the chest was
opened immediately after death, the heart was found either motionless
or contracting feebly; and in both circumstances the blood in its left
cavities was arterial.</p>

<p class='c006'>These experiments make it evident that the brain was acted on as
well as the heart, and that the immediate cause of death was stoppage
of the heart’s action. But they do not show whether the action
takes place through absorption, or by a primary nervous impression
transmitted along the nerves.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am not acquainted with any other experiments of consequence on
the operation of corrosive sublimate when introduced into the alimentary
canal. But some interesting observations have been made
by Campbell, Smith, Gaspard, and Orfila severally as to its effects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>when applied to the cellular tissue or injected at once into the blood
of a vein. It follows from their researches, taken along with those
of Sir B. Brodie, that, like arsenic, corrosive sublimate is an active
poison, to whatever part or tissue in the body it is applied.</p>

<p class='c006'>Campbell, Smith, and Orfila all agree in assigning to it dangerous
properties, when it is applied to a wound or the cellular tissue of
animals. Even in the solid state, and in the dose of three, four, or
five grains only, it causes death in the course of the second, third,
fourth, or fifth day. The symptoms antecedent to death are generally
those of dysentery; and corresponding appearances are found after
death, namely, redness, blackness, or even ulceration of the villous
coat of the stomach and rectum, the intermediate part of the alimentary
canal being sound. This poison, therefore, has, like arsenic,
the singular power of inflaming the stomach and intestines, even
when it is introduced into the system through a wound.</p>

<p class='c006'>But this is not its only property in such circumstances. According
to Smith and Orfila, it also possesses the power of inflaming both the
lungs and the heart. Orfila found the lungs unusually compact and
œdematous in some parts; and Smith observed on their anterior surface
black spots, elevated in the centre, evidently the consequence
of effusion of blood. As to the heart, in one of Smith’s experiments
black spots were found in its substance, immediately beneath the
lining membrane of the ventricles; and Orfila invariably found in
one part or another of the lining membrane, most commonly on the
valves, little spots of a cherry-red or almost black colour; nay, on
one occasion he observed these spots so soft that slight friction made
little cavities. The production of pneumonia by corrosive sublimate
when applied to a wound appears well established; but the appearances
assumed as indications of carditis are equivocal, since they
may have arisen simply from dyeing of the membrane of the heart in
the fluid part of the blood after death.</p>

<p class='c006'>The researches of Gaspard were confined to the effects of the
poison when injected at once into the blood. They show still more
clearly its tendency to cause inflammation of the lungs; and they prove
that through the channel of the blood, as through the cellular tissue,
it is apt to cause inflammation of the stomach and rectum. The
symptoms were vomiting, bloody diarrhœa, difficult breathing, apparent
pain of chest, and bloody sputa; and death took place in a
few seconds or in three or four days, according to the dose, which
varied from one to five grains. The appearances in the dead body were
principally redness in the mucous membrane of the intestines; and
in the lungs, according to the length of time the animal survived,
either black ecchymosed spots, or black tubercular masses, some inflamed,
others gangrenous, others suppurated, or finally, regular abscesses
separated from one another by healthy pulmonary tissue.<a id='r858' /><a href='#f858' class='c013'><sup>[858]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Besides the effects mentioned in the preceding abstract, two of the
experimentalists referred to have likewise observed in animals the
same remarkable operation on the salivary organs which forms so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>conspicuous a feature in the action of the compounds of mercury on
man. Dr. Campbell observed mercurial fetor, and M. Gaspard
mercurial salivation. Another writer, Zeller, found that dogs might
be made to salivate, but not graminivorous animals.<a id='r859' /><a href='#f859' class='c013'><sup>[859]</sup></a> Schubarth,
however, remarked profuse salivation in a horse, to which twenty-four
ounces of strong mercurial ointment were administered in the
way of friction in sixteen days:<a id='r860' /><a href='#f860' class='c013'><sup>[860]</sup></a> and I observed the same symptoms
in a rabbit on the sixth day after the commencement of daily mercurial
inunction.</p>

<p class='c006'>The result of the preceding inquiry is, that corrosive sublimate
causes, when swallowed, corrosion of the stomach, and in whatever
way it obtains entrance into the body, irritation of that organ and of
the rectum, inflammation of the lungs, depressed action and perhaps
also inflammation of the heart, oppression of the functions of the brain,
inflammation of the salivary glands. These phenomena are diversified
enough. But it will presently be found that other organs still are
implicated in its effects on man.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before proceeding, however, to its effects on man, some notice
may be taken of a question, connected with its mode of action,
which has long been the subject of controversy. The experiments
already quoted render it probable that corrosive sublimate, before it
can exert its remote action, must enter the blood; and the facts to be
enumerated under the next head of the present section will render it
probable that the milder compounds of mercury used in medicine
also act in a similar manner. Physicians and chemists, therefore,
long sought to discover this metal in the solids and fluids of the body
while under its influence; and the failure of some attempts to detect
it has naturally led to its presence throughout the system being called
in question by many. This inquiry, besides its interest in a physiological
point of view, is highly important in respect to medico-legal
practice, since it forms a material branch of the general questions
which at present occupy the attention of medical jurists,—whether
poisons that act through the blood should be sought for by chemical
analysis in other parts of the body besides the stomach, intestines, or
other organ to which they have been directly applied—and in what
particular quarters the search should be principally made.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the case of mercury, the evidence of the absorption of the poison,
and of its entering the tissues and secretions of the body, is now unimpeachable.
This is chiefly derived from observations and experiments
made on man and animals after the long-continued use of the
milder preparations of mercury; it being imagined that if the poison
enters the blood at all, the greatest quantity will be found under
these circumstances. The facts may be arranged under three heads.
Some relate to the discharge of metallic mercury from the living
body during a mercurial course for medicinal purposes; others to the
discovery of metallic mercury in the dead body after a mercurial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>course, and others to the detection of mercury by a careful chemical
analysis in the fluids and solids during life or after death.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many stories are related by the older authors of the discharge of
running quicksilver from the living body during a mercurial course.
Some of the most authentic of them have been collected by Zeller.
In his list of cases it is stated that Schenkius met with an instance
of the discharge of a spoonful of quicksilver by vomiting; that Rhodius
twice remarked quicksilver pass with the urine; and that
Hochstetter once saw it exhaled with the sweat.<a id='r861' /><a href='#f861' class='c013'><sup>[861]</sup></a> Fallopius likewise
states, that in people who had used mercurial inunction for
three years, and who had the bones of the leg laid bare by suppurating
nodes, he had seen quicksilver collected in globules on the
tibia; and he speaks of its being the practice in his day to draw
the mercury from the body, when overloaded with it, by successively
amalgamating a bit of gold in the mouth and heating the
amalgam to expel the mercury.<a id='r862' /><a href='#f862' class='c013'><sup>[862]</sup></a> With regard to these statements
of the older authors it may be observed that, although their singularity
renders them questionable, they ought not to be rejected at
once, as some have done, merely because corresponding facts have
not been witnessed in modern times; for no one can now-a days
have such opportunities for observation as were enjoyed by Fallopius
and his contemporaries. The experiment of amalgamating
gold in the mouth of a person under a course of mercury has always
failed in modern times. But who can now have an opportunity of
making the experiment during a mercurial course of three years? Besides,
the statements quoted above are not all destitute of modern
confirmation. Thus Fourcroy has noticed the case of a gilder attacked
with an eruption of little boils, in each of which was contained
a globule of quicksilver. Bruckmann mentions the case of a lady
who subsequently to a course of mercury remarked after a dance
many small black stains on her breast, and minute globules of quicksilver
in the folds of her shift.<a id='r863' /><a href='#f863' class='c013'><sup>[863]</sup></a> And Dr. Jourda has described in a
late French periodical a case where fluid mercury was passed by the
urine. The last fact appears satisfactory in all its circumstances.
A patient had been taking corrosive sublimate for a month in the
dose of a grain, besides using for the first sixteen days a gargle containing
metallic mercury finely divided. Towards the close of the
month he observed on the sill of the window, on which he used to
turn up his chamber-pot after using it, many little globules of mercury,
amounting in all to four grains. Dr. Jourda on learning this
observation of his patient collected some of the urine with care,
and after it had stood some time found in it a black, powdery
sediment, which, when separated and dried, formed little globules
of mercury.<a id='r864' /><a href='#f864' class='c013'><sup>[864]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The next class of facts in favour of the entrance of mercury into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>the blood are derived from the discovery of the metal in the bodies
of persons who had undergone a long mercurial course recently
before death. In the German Ephemerides it is said that no less
than a pound of it was found in the brain and two ounces in the
skull-cap of one who had been long salivated.<a id='r865' /><a href='#f865' class='c013'><sup>[865]</sup></a> This is certainly
too marvellous a story. But analogous observations have been
made lately. In Hufeland’s Journal it is mentioned that a skull
found in a churchyard contained running quicksilver in the texture
of its bones, and that there is preserved in the Lubben cabinet
of midwifery a pelvis infiltered with mercury, and taken from
a young woman who died of syphilis.<a id='r866' /><a href='#f866' class='c013'><sup>[866]</sup></a> An unequivocal fact of the
same nature has been related by Mr. Rigby Brodbelt. In a body
of which he could not learn the history he found mercurial globules
as big as a pin-head lying on the os hyoides, laryngeal cartilages,
frontal bone, sternum, and tibia.<a id='r867' /><a href='#f867' class='c013'><sup>[867]</sup></a> Another equally unquestionable
fact of the kind has been supplied by Dr. Otto. On scraping
the periosteum of several of the bones of a man who had laboured
under syphilis, he remarked minute globules issuing from the osseous
substance: in some places globules were deposited between the
bone and periosteum, where the latter had been detached in the progress
of putrefaction; and in other places, when the bones were
struck, a shower of fine globules fell from them.<a id='r868' /><a href='#f868' class='c013'><sup>[868]</sup></a> Wibmer observes
that Fricke, surgeon to the Hamburg Infirmary, has obtained mercury
by boiling the bones of persons who had been long under a
course of mercurial inunction.<a id='r869' /><a href='#f869' class='c013'><sup>[869]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The third and most satisfactory class of facts are the result of actual
chemical analysis. These results were long variable. On the
one hand, Mayer, Marabelli,<a id='r870' /><a href='#f870' class='c013'><sup>[870]</sup></a> and Devergie,<a id='r871' /><a href='#f871' class='c013'><sup>[871]</sup></a> failed to detect mercury
in the fluids of people under a mercurial course; and I myself,<a id='r872' /><a href='#f872' class='c013'><sup>[872]</sup></a>
as well as Dr. Samuel Wright,<a id='r873' /><a href='#f873' class='c013'><sup>[873]</sup></a> had no better success in some experiments
on animals. On the other hand, Zeller detected it after death
in the blood and bile, Cantu procured it from the urine, Buchner
found it in the blood, saliva, and urine, and Schubarth extracted it
from the blood. The first experimentalist found that in the blood and
bile of animals killed by mercurial inunction, mercury could be detected
by destructive distillation, but not by any fluid tests.<a id='r874' /><a href='#f874' class='c013'><sup>[874]</sup></a> Cantu,
by operating on sixty pounds of urine, taken from persons under the
action of mercury, procured no less than twenty grains of the metal
from the sediment.<a id='r875' /><a href='#f875' class='c013'><sup>[875]</sup></a> The experiments of Buchner are very satisfactory.
By destructive distillation of the crassamentum of seven ounces
of blood taken from a patient who was salivated by mercury, he obtained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>rather more than a quarter of a grain of globules; two pounds
of saliva yielded in the same way a 200th of a grain; and the urine
contained so much that it became brownish-black with sulphuretted-hydrogen.<a id='r876' /><a href='#f876' class='c013'><sup>[876]</sup></a>
Buchner likewise adds, that Professor Pickel of Würzburg
procured mercury by destructive distillation from the brain of a
venereal patient who had long taken corrosive sublimate.<a id='r877' /><a href='#f877' class='c013'><sup>[877]</sup></a> Not less
satisfactory are the experiments of Dr. Schubarth. A horse after
being rubbed for twenty-nine days with mercurial ointment to the
total amount of eighty ounces, died of fever, emaciation, diarrhœa,
and ptyalism. On the sixteenth day, when ptyalism had set in, a
quart of blood was drawn from the jugular vein, and after death
another quart was collected from the heart, great vessels and lungs,—extreme
care being taken to collect it perfectly pure. In each
specimen there was procured by destructive distillation a liquor, in
which minute metallic globules were visible. A copper coin agitated
in the liquor was whitened; and when the oily matter was separated
by filtration and boiling in alcohol, the residue gave with nitric acid
a solution, which produced an orange precipitate with hydriodate of
potass.</p>

<p class='c006'>These researches were considered adequate to prove the strong
probability of the absorption of mercurial preparations when introduced
into the animal. But the frequency with which negative results
were obtained by competent inquirers, and in circumstances
apparently favourable, threw an air of doubt over the positive facts,
however clear they seem to be in themselves,—till at length Professor
Orfila proved by a series of careful experiments that the cause
of failure must generally have been the want of a process sufficiently
delicate: for in all ordinary circumstances, by using his process
described above, he succeeded in obtaining mercury in the urine and
liver of animals poisoned with corrosive sublimate, as well as in the
urine of patients who were taking that salt in medicinal doses. He
could not detect it, however, in the blood.<a id='r878' /><a href='#f878' class='c013'><sup>[878]</sup></a> Since these investigations,
Professor Landerer of Athens detected mercury in the brain,
liver, lungs and spinal cord of a man who poisoned himself with two
ounces and a half of corrosive sublimate;<a id='r879' /><a href='#f879' class='c013'><sup>[879]</sup></a> and M. Audouard has
twice found it in the urine and once in the saliva of persons salivated
with mercury, by simply transmitting chlorine, exposing the liquid to
the air for a day, evaporating it nearly to dryness, dissolving the
residue in water slightly acidulated with hydrochloric acid, immersing
copper-leaf for twenty-four hours, and heating the stained portions
in a tube.<a id='r880' /><a href='#f880' class='c013'><sup>[880]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The cases of poisoning with the preparations of mercury, which
have been observed in the human subject, may be conveniently
arranged under three varieties. In one variety the sole or leading
symptoms are those of violent irritation of the alimentary canal.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>In another the symptoms are at first the same as in the former, but
subsequently become united with salivation and inflammation of the
mouth, or some of the other disorders incident to mercurial erethysm,
as it is called. In a third variety the preliminary stage of
irritation in the alimentary canal is wanting, and the symptoms are
from beginning to end those of mercurial erethysm in one or another
of its multifarious forms.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first variety of poisoning with mercury is remarked only
in those who have taken considerable doses of its soluble salts,
particularly corrosive sublimate. The second is produced by the
same preparations. The third may be caused by any mercurial compound.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. The symptoms in the first variety are very like what occur in
the ordinary cases of poisoning with arsenic,—namely, vomiting,
especially when any thing is swallowed, violent pain in the pit of the
stomach, as well as over the whole belly, and profuse diarrhœa. But
there exist between the effects of the two poisons some shades of difference
which it is necessary to attend to.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first place,—taking corrosive sublimate as the best example
of the preparations which cause this variety of poisoning with
mercury,—the symptoms generally begin much sooner than those
caused by arsenic. The symptoms of irritation in the throat may
begin immediately, nay, even during the very act of swallowing;<a id='r881' /><a href='#f881' class='c013'><sup>[881]</sup></a>
and those in the stomach may appear either immediately,<a id='r882' /><a href='#f882' class='c013'><sup>[882]</sup></a> or within
five minutes.<a id='r883' /><a href='#f883' class='c013'><sup>[883]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Secondly, the taste is much more unequivocal and strong. Even
a small quantity of corrosive sublimate, either in the solid or fluid
state, and considerably diluted, has so strong and so horrible a
taste, that no one could swallow it in a form capable of causing
much irritation in the stomach, without being at once made sensible
by the taste that he had taken something unusual and injurious.
Occasionally, indeed, persons thus warned of their danger while in
the act of swallowing the poison, have stopped in time to escape
fatal consequences.<a id='r884' /><a href='#f884' class='c013'><sup>[884]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Thirdly, the sense of acridity which it excites in the gullet during
the act of deglutition, and throughout the whole course of the subsequent
inflammation of the alimentary canal, is usually much stronger.
If the dose be not small, or largely diluted, or in the solid form,
the sense of tightness, acridity, or burning in the throat and gullet
during deglutition is often far greater than ever occurs at any stage
in the instance of arsenic; and sometimes it is very severe even when
corrosive sublimate is taken in the solid form.<a id='r885' /><a href='#f885' class='c013'><sup>[885]</sup></a> The tightness and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>burning in the throat often continue throughout the whole duration
of the poisoning; and may be so excessive as to cause complete inability
to swallow,<a id='r886' /><a href='#f886' class='c013'><sup>[886]</sup></a> or even to speak.<a id='r887' /><a href='#f887' class='c013'><sup>[887]</sup></a> Occasionally the affection of
the throat is the only material injury inflicted by the poison, as in a
case related by Dr. J. Johnstone of a young woman, who tried to swallow
two drachms of corrosive sublimate in the solid state, but was
unable to force it down on account of the constriction it caused in the
gullet. She died in six days of mortification of the throat.<a id='r888' /><a href='#f888' class='c013'><sup>[888]</sup></a> The
greater violence of the action of corrosive sublimate on the throat,
compared with that of arsenic, is evidently owing to its greater solubility
and powerful chemical operation on the animal textures.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fourthly, instead of the contracted ghastly countenance observed
in cases of poisoning with arsenic (but which, it will be remembered,
is not invariable in that kind of poisoning), those who are suffering
under the primary effects of corrosive sublimate have frequently the
countenance much flushed, and even swelled.<a id='r889' /><a href='#f889' class='c013'><sup>[889]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Corrosive sublimate seems to occasion more frequently than arsenic
the discharge of blood by vomiting and purging,—obviously because
it is a more powerful local irritant.</p>

<p class='c006'>It likewise gives rise more frequently to irritation of the urinary
passages. This irritation generally consists in frequent, painful micturition;
but the secretion of urine is often suppressed altogether.
Instances of this kind have been related by Mr. Valentine,<a id='r890' /><a href='#f890' class='c013'><sup>[890]</sup></a> by my
colleague, Professor Syme,<a id='r891' /><a href='#f891' class='c013'><sup>[891]</sup></a> by an anonymous writer in the Medical
and Physical Journal,<a id='r892' /><a href='#f892' class='c013'><sup>[892]</sup></a> by Dr. Venables,<a id='r893' /><a href='#f893' class='c013'><sup>[893]</sup></a> by Mr. Blacklock,<a id='r894' /><a href='#f894' class='c013'><sup>[894]</sup></a> and
by M. Ollivier, in whose case, however, the poison was the bicyanide
of mercury.<a id='r895' /><a href='#f895' class='c013'><sup>[895]</sup></a> In the last three cases the suppression was total,
and continued till death; which did not ensue, in one till eight, in
the next till five, and in the last till nine days after the poison was
taken. Sometimes, as in Ollivier’s case, the urinary irritation is attended
with symptoms of excitement of the external parts, such as
swelling and blackness of the scrotum and erection of the penis.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another distinction seems to be that corrosive sublimate is more
apt than arsenic to cause nervous affections during the first inflammatory
stage. The tendency to doze, which sometimes interrupts the
inflammatory symptoms caused by arsenic, has been more frequently
observed in cases of poisoning with corrosive sublimate.<a id='r896' /><a href='#f896' class='c013'><sup>[896]</sup></a> The same
may be said of tremors and twitches of the extremities. Sometimes
the stupor approaches even to absolute coma;<a id='r897' /><a href='#f897' class='c013'><sup>[897]</sup></a> and the twitches occasionally
amount to distinct, nay violent convulsions.<a id='r898' /><a href='#f898' class='c013'><sup>[898]</sup></a> In other
instances paraplegia has been witnessed.<a id='r899' /><a href='#f899' class='c013'><sup>[899]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>Another difference is, that the effects of mercurial irritants are
fully more curable than those of arsenic. Recovery has taken place
even after half an ounce was swallowed, with the effect of inducing
both bloody vomiting and purging.<a id='r900' /><a href='#f900' class='c013'><sup>[900]</sup></a> This may depend in part on
the greater solubility of mercurial preparations, so that they are more
easily discharged than arsenic, which often remains in the stomach
after days of continual vomiting,—and in part on corrosive sublimate
and other soluble salts of mercury being converted, in no long
time and much more easily, into comparatively innocuous compounds,
either by antidotes intentionally given for the purpose, or by animal
principles in the secretions and accidental contents of the alimentary
canal.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lastly, deviations from the ordinary course and combination of the
symptoms appear to be more rare in the instance of corrosive sublimate
than in that of arsenic.</p>

<p class='c006'>To these general statements, it may be right to add the heads of
one or two actual cases, lest an exaggerated idea be conveyed of the
combination of the symptoms as they usually occur. For this purpose
it will be sufficient to refer to a fatal case related by M. Devergie,
to an instance of recovery, without salivation having supervened,
which is contained in Orfila’s Toxicology, and to another by Dr.
Vautier, presenting the mildest possible symptoms of this variety.
In Devergie’s case, the patient, a female, swallowed three drachms
of corrosive sublimate in solution, and was soon after seized with
vomiting, purging, and pain in the belly. In five hours, when she
was first seen by Devergie, the skin was cold and damp, the limbs
relaxed, the face pale, the eyes dull, and the expression that of horror
and anxiety. The lips and tongue were white and shrivelled;
and she had dreadful fits of pain and spasm in the throat whenever
she attempted to swallow liquids, also burning and pricking along
the course of the gullet, and increase of pain in these parts on pressure.
There was likewise frequent vomiting of mucous and bilious
matter, with burning pain in the stomach and tenderness of the epigastrium
on the slightest pressure. She had farther profuse diarrhœa,
with pricking pain and tenesmus. The pulsation of the heart was
deep and slow, the pulse at the wrist almost imperceptible, and the
breathing much retarded. In eighteen hours these symptoms continued
without any material change; but the limbs were also then insensible.
In twenty-three hours she died in a fit of fainting, the
mind having been entire to the last.<a id='r901' /><a href='#f901' class='c013'><sup>[901]</sup></a>—Orfila’s case was that of a
gentleman who drank by mistake an alcoholic solution of corrosive
sublimate, but fortunately was so much alarmed by its taste while
drinking it, that he did not finish the poisonous draught. Nevertheless,
he was instantly attacked with a sense of tightness in the throat
and burning in the stomach, and then with vomiting and purging.
Two hours after the accident Orfila found him with the face very full
and red, the eyes sparkling and restless, the pupils contracted, and
the lips dry and cracked. There was also acute pain along the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>course of the alimentary canal, particularly in the throat. The belly
was swelled, and so tender that he could not bear the weight of fomentation-cloths.
The pulse was 112, small and sharp; the skin
intensely hot and pungent; micturition scanty, frequent, and difficult;
the breathing very much oppressed; the purging bilious. The patient
had likewise a tendency to doze, and was affected with occasional
convulsive twitches of the face and extremities, and with constant
cramps in the limbs. Next morning all the symptoms were
sensibly mitigated; and they went on decreasing till convalescence
was established in eight days. In the course of a few weeks he recovered
his usual health, without suffering salivation.<a id='r902' /><a href='#f902' class='c013'><sup>[902]</sup></a>—In Vautier’s
case, where sixteen grains had been swallowed, the patient was immediately
attacked with pain in the throat and stomach, cold extremities,
trembling of the arms and legs, vomiting, paleness of the features,
and great feebleness of the pulse. Vomiting being promoted
by frequent draughts of warm water, and white of egg given subsequently,
no further symptoms ensued, those first excited slowly subsided,
and in a few days recovery took place, without any salivation.
Yet it was upwards of half an hour before any measures could be
taken for his relief.<a id='r903' /><a href='#f903' class='c013'><sup>[903]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The only material and common symptom which was wanting in
the case now related was blood in the stools and in the matter vomited.
In other respects they are good examples of the ordinary train
of symptoms in cases of the present variety. For other examples of
the same nature the reader may refer particularly to the paper of Mr.
Valentine, who has described five cases that happened at one time in
the same family, the mother having attempted to poison herself and
four children.<a id='r904' /><a href='#f904' class='c013'><sup>[904]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It may sometimes be necessary to know the usual duration of this
variety of mercurial poisoning, and also the extremes of its duration.
On these points I have not hitherto had opportunities of consulting a
sufficient number of cases to be able to lay down the general rule
with precision. But, so far as my inquiries go, the ordinary duration
in fatal cases is from twenty-four to thirty-six hours. It is probable
that a few may last three days,<a id='r905' /><a href='#f905' class='c013'><sup>[905]</sup></a> but only one instance has
come under my notice where the duration was greater; and in that
instance, which is described by Dr. Venables, life was prolonged
under great agony from pain of the belly, bloody vomiting, diarrhœa
and suppression of urine, but without salivation, for no less than
eight days.<a id='r906' /><a href='#f906' class='c013'><sup>[906]</sup></a> In cases of recovery the symptoms of irritation may
continue very long, and nevertheless not pass into the second variety
of this kind of poisoning,—a transition, however, which on the whole
is uncommon. In the case of which an analysis has been given from
Orfila’s narrative, and likewise in one of Mr. Valentine’s patients who
recovered, the symptoms all along were those of irritation in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>alimentary canal; there was not any ptyalism, or other symptom of
proper mercurial erethysm.—The shortest duration yet recorded is
two hours and a half. This was in a case related by Dr. Bigsby of
Newark-on-Trent, where a tea-spoonful of a concentrated solution of
nitrate of mercury was swallowed by a lad sixteen years old, and
where the chief symptoms were burning pain from the mouth to the
stomach, tenderness of the whole belly, mucous vomiting, and feculent
purging.<a id='r907' /><a href='#f907' class='c013'><sup>[907]</sup></a> In a case which occurred in London, and which has
been published succinctly by Mr. Illingworth, death must have occurred
either as soon, or very shortly afterwards. The dose of
corrosive sublimate, though not positively ascertained, was large.<a id='r908' /><a href='#f908' class='c013'><sup>[908]</sup></a>
Next to this the shortest case recorded proved fatal in eleven
hours.<a id='r909' /><a href='#f909' class='c013'><sup>[909]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>2. The second variety of poisoning with mercury comprehends the
cases, which begin, like the former, with irritation in the alimentary
canal, but in which the symptoms of what is called mercurial erethysm
gradually supervene. In fatal cases of this description death sometimes
arises from the primary action of the poison, exactly as in the
previous variety; but in other instances it is owing to general disturbance
of the constitution, or the local devastation, brought on by the
secondary effects.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is unnecessary to describe here the several forms of mercurial
erethysm which may thus be developed, because they will immediately
be considered under the third variety of mercurial poisoning. It
is sufficient to state in passing that the leading affection is inflammation
of the organs in and adjoining the mouth, and more particularly
of the salivary glands.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it may be right to endeavour in the present place to fix the
period of the poisoning at which these secondary affections may and
usually do commence. This cannot be done so satisfactorily as might
be wished, because the cases already published which I have been
able to examine do not form a large enough induction. Among the
recorded cases I have hitherto seen, salivation has never been retarded
beyond the third day;<a id='r910' /><a href='#f910' class='c013'><sup>[910]</sup></a> but in an instance of suicide by corrosive
sublimate which happened in the Castle of Edinburgh in 1826, and
which was communicated to me by the late Dr. Shortt, the salivation
did not begin till the fourth. Salivation seldom comes on sooner
than the beginning of the second;<a id='r911' /><a href='#f911' class='c013'><sup>[911]</sup></a> and the most usual date of its
commencement is towards the close of the second day. There is
little doubt that it may be retarded till a period considerably later
than I have yet found recorded. It is doubtful whether true mercurial
salivation ever begins much sooner than after the first twenty-four
hours. Occasionally, however, corrosive sublimate produces salivation
of a different kind, which has been mistaken for the specific
variety caused by mercury. Thus in a paper on the cure of gonorrhœa
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>by corrosive sublimate in single large doses, communicated by
Mr. Addington of West Bromwich to Dr. Beddoes, it is stated that
a grain and a half, taken at once in half an ounce of rectified spirit,
causes immediately “a great burning in the throat and stomach, and
quickly afterwards a copious salivation, lasting between an hour and
a half and two hours, and amounting frequently to more than a quart.”<a id='r912' /><a href='#f912' class='c013'><sup>[912]</sup></a>
These facts have been appealed to by authors in medical jurisprudence
as proving the rapid production of mercurial salivation. But the effect
produced is not the specific ptyalism of mercury; for its brief duration
is scarcely consistent with this supposition. And farther, the author
goes on to observe, that, if the dose be taken on going to bed, the
latter part of the night is passed quietly, and no inconvenience is felt
afterwards, even when the dose is taken five or six times at intervals
of three or four days. The effects here observed is a sympathetic
phenomenon depending on the topical action of the poison. And
such, I have no doubt, has been the nature of the salivation in several
cases of poisoning with corrosive sublimate, which have been supposed
to be at variance with the general rule, that this affection does
not begin till about twenty-four hours have elapsed. Such seems to
have been the nature of the salivation in a case published by Dr.
Perry,<a id='r913' /><a href='#f913' class='c013'><sup>[913]</sup></a> that of a girl who was attacked with swelling of the cheeks
and lower lip, burning in the throat, flushed face, feeble pulse, and
cold, clammy extremities after swallowing corrosive sublimate, and
who had a copious flow of saliva in an hour and a half; for there
is no mention made of fetor, and the girl was well enough to leave
the hospital in a few days,—which could scarcely happen if she had
been affected with ptyalism from the constitutional action of mercury.—In
like manner Dr. Alexander Wood has related a case, fatal in
fourteen days, in which the patient said salivation came on in seven
hours.<a id='r914' /><a href='#f914' class='c013'><sup>[914]</sup></a> But, notwithstanding Dr. Wood’s argument in support of
the patient’s statement,—for he did not see him till nine days after
the poison was taken,—there is no satisfactory evidence that the
salivation was the true constitutional salivation of mercury, and not
simply the result of its topical action, which seems to have been very
severe.—Farther, in an instance related by Dr. H. Anderson of Belfast,
where salivation appeared to him to begin in nineteen hours, it
seems not improbable that he mistook for mercurial ptyalism the common
salivation arising from inability to swallow on account of sore
throat; for this patient too was quite convalescent in three days.<a id='r915' /><a href='#f915' class='c013'><sup>[915]</sup></a>—Mr.
Alfred Taylor alludes to a case in Guy’s Hospital of salivation
occurring in four hours; but so briefly, that its true influence on
the present question cannot be judged of.<a id='r916' /><a href='#f916' class='c013'><sup>[916]</sup></a>—On the whole, then,
although it is clear that ptyalism of one kind or another may occur
very soon after corrosive sublimate is swallowed, it remains a matter
of doubt, whether the true, specific ptyalism, depending on the constitutional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>action of the poison begins sooner than after an interval of
above twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the total duration of this variety in fatal cases, I have found
an instance fatal on the fourth day, salivation having begun on the
second;<a id='r917' /><a href='#f917' class='c013'><sup>[917]</sup></a> and Orfila quotes a case from Degner, in which the
gastro-enteritic symptoms were succeeded by ptyalism about the
same period, and which proved fatal in fifteen days.<a id='r918' /><a href='#f918' class='c013'><sup>[918]</sup></a> These periods,
however, probably do not form the extremes; for in such
cases as the former death is the consequence of the primary affection,
and may therefore ensue immediately after the secondary stage has
begun to develope itself; and when death arises from profuse salivation,
as in Degner’s patient, or from the ravages committed by ulceration
and gangrene, it may be delayed almost as long as in cases
of the third variety of mercurial poisoning, in which there is no precursory
stage of inflammation in the alimentary canal.</p>

<p class='c006'>Death may arise, not only from the primary action of the poison,
or from the exhaustion caused by mercurial erethysm, but likewise
from incidental occurrences. Thus, in Dr. Alexander Wood’s case,
referred to above, death arose directly from sudden profuse hemorrhage
from the bowels, to the amount of six pounds.</p>

<p class='c006'>The present variety of poisoning with corrosive sublimate may
be concluded with the heads of an excellent example related in the
Medical and Physical Journal. The patient, a stout young girl,
swallowed soon after supper a drachm of corrosive sublimate dissolved
in beer, and in a few minutes she was found on her knees in
great torture. All the primary symptoms of this kind of poisoning
were present in their most violent form,—burning in the stomach,
extending towards the throat and mouth, followed in no long time by
violent vomiting of a matter at first mucous, afterwards bilious and
bloody; by purging of a brownish, fetid fluid; suppression of urine
and much tenderness of the urethra and bladder; small, contracted,
frequent pulse, anxious countenance, and considerable stupor, interrupted
frequently by fits of increased pain. All these symptoms were
developed in four hours. Subsequently the pain in the stomach became
much easier, but that in the throat much worse. At length in
the course of the second day, the teeth became loose, the gums tender,
the saliva more abundant than natural; profuse ptyalism and
great fetor of the breath ensued, and the patient expired towards the
close of the fourth day.<a id='r919' /><a href='#f919' class='c013'><sup>[919]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>3. The third variety of poisoning with mercury comprehends all
the forms of what is called mercurial erethysm. Without endeavouring
to settle the precise meaning of this term, which is now
used in rather a vague sense, I shall consider under the present head
all the secondary and chronic effects of mercury. These may be
caused by any of its preparations, but are most frequently seen as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>the consequence of its milder compounds, either given medicinally
in frequent small doses, or applied continuously to the bodies of
workmen who are exposed by their trade to its fumes.</p>

<p class='c006'>The secondary and chronic effects of mercury are multifarious
enough in reality; but if credit were given to all that has been
written, and is still sometimes maintained on this subject, almost
every disease in the nosology might be enumerated under the present
head; for there is scarcely a disease of common occurrence,
which has not been imputed by one author or another to the direct
or indirect operation of mercury. The present remarks, however,
will be confined as much as possible to what is well ascertained, and
bears on the medical evidence of poisoning with mercury, or is important
in regard to medical police. With this view, salivation
and its concomitants, the most usual of the secondary effects of mercury,
will first be treated of. Some observations will then be made
on the shaking palsy, or mercurial tremor, which is caused in those
who work with mercury. And in conclusion, a short view will be
taken of the other diseases which are more indirectly induced by
this poison, as well as some which have been ascribed to it on insufficient
grounds. This being done, the mode of action of mercurial
poisons will be resumed, and a description given of their relative
effects when introduced by different channels and in different chemical
forms.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of Mercurial Salivation.</i>—Mercurial salivation may be caused
by any of the preparations of mercury, and either by a single dose
or by frequently repeated small doses. It may be caused by corrosive
sublimate as the secondary stage of a case which commenced
with inflammation in the alimentary canal; or it may be the first sign
of mercurial action, as in the medicinal mode of administering calomel
and blue pill. Even in the latter case a single dose, and that
not large, may be sufficient to induce ptyalism of the most violent
kind. When induced by a single dose it usually commences between
the beginning of the second and end of the third day, rarely
within twenty-four hours. But an extraordinary case is mentioned
by Dr. Bright, where five grains, put on the tongue in apoplexy and
not washed over, excited in three hours most violent salivation, with
such swelling of the tongue that scarifications became necessary.<a id='r920' /><a href='#f920' class='c013'><sup>[920]</sup></a> It
commences with a brassy taste and tenderness of the mouth, swelling,
redness, and subsequently ulceration of the gums; peculiar fetor
of the breath; and at last an augmentation is observed in the flow
of the saliva, commonly accompanied with fulness around the lower
jaw. These symptoms increase more or less rapidly. Sometimes
they are very mild; nay, this form of the secondary effects of mercury
may consist in nothing else than brassy taste, tenderness of the
mouth, redness of the gums, and fetor. On the other hand, the
symptoms are often very violent, the salivation being profuse, the
face swelled so as to close the eyes, and almost fill up the space between
the jaw and clavicles, the tongue swollen so as to threaten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>suffocation, the inside of the mouth ulcerated, nay gangrenous, and
at times the gangrene extends over the face. It is not uncommon to
observe severe and extensive ulceration without particular increase
of the saliva.</p>

<p class='c006'>These local affections are almost always accompanied with more
or less constitutional disorder. If severe, they are attended with the
symptomatic fever proper to inflammation and gangrene, from whatever
cause they spring. But independently of that, mercurial salivation
is accompanied, and indeed commonly preceded, by a constitutional
disorder or symptomatic fever of its own, which occasionally exhibits
some peculiarities. The mildest affection of the mouth and salivary
glands is very generally preceded by some exaltation of the pulse and
temperature, and other symptoms of fever. But when the local disorder
begins violently, and above all when this takes place by idiosyncrasy
from small doses of mild preparations, there is often great
rapidity of the pulse, irregular action of the heart, and various nervous
disorders possessing the hysteric character,—all of which, except the
quick pulse, will sometimes gradually abate or even disappear, when
the salivation is fairly established.</p>

<p class='c006'>The phenomena of ordinary mercurial salivation being familiar to
every practitioner, it is unnecessary to quote here any illustrative
example; but the following instance may be given to exemplify its
most malignant forms. A patient of Mr. Potter of Chipping-Ongar,
in Essex, after taking eighteen grains of blue pill in divided doses
during three days, was seized with excessive salivation and great
constitutional disturbance, indicated by offensive evacuations, copious
sweating, bleeding from the nose, purple spots on the skin, dilated
pupils, and such severe local disease that the teeth dropped out, and
he expired six days after mercurial action set in.<a id='r921' /><a href='#f921' class='c013'><sup>[921]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>As the phenomena of mercurial salivation have been often known to
lead to important evidence and much contrariety of opinion upon
trials, it will be necessary to dwell at some length on some parts of
the subject.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first instance, then, the dose which is required to bring on
salivation may be noticed. It is needless to mention the ordinary
quantity required in mercurial courses. A more useful object of
consideration is the departure from the ordinary rule. One of the
most common and important of these deviations is excessive sensibility
to the action of mercury, in consequence of which the individuals
who have this idiosyncrasy may be profusely salivated by one or two
small doses even of the mildest preparations. Three grains of corrosive
sublimate divided into three doses have caused violent ptyalism.<a id='r922' /><a href='#f922' class='c013'><sup>[922]</sup></a>
Fifteen grains of blue pill, taken in three doses, one every night,
have excited fatal salivation.<a id='r923' /><a href='#f923' class='c013'><sup>[923]</sup></a> Nay, two grains of calomel have
caused ptyalism, extensive ulceration of the throat, exfoliation of the
lower jaw, and death.<a id='r924' /><a href='#f924' class='c013'><sup>[924]</sup></a> Three drachms of mercurial ointment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>applied externally have caused violent ptyalism and death in eight
days. On the other hand, it is well known that some constitutions
resist the action of mercurials very obstinately, so as even sometimes
to appear incapable of being salivated at all. I have more than once
met with cases of the last description, where mercurial courses had
been continued for three months and upwards without avail. It may
be added, that, except in constitutions naturally predisposed to suffer
from a few small doses, a few large doses do not appear apt to excite
severe salivation, or even to cause any at all. This has been clearly
shown in the course of the practice lately introduced of administering
calomel in doses of a scruple. On that subject more will be said by
and by. At present I may mention, that, in conformity with the
practice alluded to, I have several times, in various diseases, given
eight or ten grains of calomel five or six times a day for two or three
days together, without observing that ptyalism was apt to ensue.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next point to be considered is, whether mercurial salivation
can be confounded with any other affection. In a very difficult case
of poisoning which was tried here in 1817, that of William Patterson
for murdering his wife,<a id='r925' /><a href='#f925' class='c013'><sup>[925]</sup></a> it appeared probable that he had given her
repeatedly large doses of calomel. But the proof of this was circumstantial
only, and an important circumstance in the chain of
evidence was a deposition to the occurrence of salivation during the
woman’s illness. This fact, however, rested on the skill and testimony
of a quack doctor only; and the admissibility of such a person
to decide on a point of this nature, will depend on the facility with
which the true mercurial form of salivation can be recognised. This
statement will show the practical object of what is to follow.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many other causes may excite a preternatural flow of saliva. Several
other poisons may have that effect, for example, preparations of
gold, preparations of copper, antimony, croton-oil, and foxglove:
foxglove has been known to cause violent salivation for three weeks.<a id='r926' /><a href='#f926' class='c013'><sup>[926]</sup></a>
Opium too has occasionally excited salivation,<a id='r927' /><a href='#f927' class='c013'><sup>[927]</sup></a> and also hydrocyanic
acid and iodide of potassium.</p>

<p class='c006'>Even a common sore throat, if the swelling and pain are so great
as to render swallowing very difficult and distressing, may be accompanied,
as every physician must have remarked, with a profuse flow
of saliva; and in the ulcerative stage there is also often a fetor that
is hardly distinguishable from the mercurial kind. In the ulceration
of the mouth called <i>cancrum oris</i> there is some salivation with great
fetor of the breath.</p>

<p class='c006'>Salivation likewise forms an idiopathic disease, and may then be
both profuse and obstinate. Mr. Davies has described a case of
spontaneous ptyalism which had lasted for a fortnight before he was
called to see the patient; and during all that time the quantity of
saliva discharged was two or three pints daily. How long it endured
afterwards he does not mention; but it must have continued
for some time, because during his attendance first one physician and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>then another were called into consultation with him. Laxatives
slowly removed it. Mr. Davies has not described the state of the
mouth; but the first physician mistook the salivation for a mercurial
one.<a id='r928' /><a href='#f928' class='c013'><sup>[928]</sup></a> In the same journal which contains this case another has
been related which lasted four months.<a id='r929' /><a href='#f929' class='c013'><sup>[929]</sup></a> Another very remarkable
case has been recorded by Mr. Power. The patient, a young lady,
discharged for more than two years from sixteen to forty ounces of
saliva daily. In the last two cases the mouth was not affected.<a id='r930' /><a href='#f930' class='c013'><sup>[930]</sup></a> Two
other instances have been related by M. Bayle, in one of which the
patient was cured after spitting five pounds daily for nine years and
a half; while the other continued to be affected after spitting profusely
for three years. In neither was there any ulceration of the
mouth.<a id='r931' /><a href='#f931' class='c013'><sup>[931]</sup></a> An instance has been related by an Italian physician, Dr.
Petrunti, where, in the course of various nervous affections of the
hysteric character, the patient became affected with heat and tightness
in the throat, and so profuse a salivation for two months, that
between three and four pounds were discharged daily.<a id='r932' /><a href='#f932' class='c013'><sup>[932]</sup></a> A case
somewhat similar is related in Rust’s Magazin of a man who suffered
upwards of two years from a daily salivation alternating occasionally
with a mucous discharge from the bowels or lungs.<a id='r933' /><a href='#f933' class='c013'><sup>[933]</sup></a> M. Guibourt
describes the case of a lady who had an attack of profuse salivation
every thirty, forty, or fifty days, lasting between twenty-four and
forty-eight hours, and unaccompanied with any other affection of the
mouth or adjoining parts except a sense of tightness in the throat.<a id='r934' /><a href='#f934' class='c013'><sup>[934]</sup></a>
M. Gorham relates an interesting case of a lady who in three successive
pregnancies was attacked soon after impregnation with excessive
ptyalism, which continued to the extent of between two and
four quarts daily until the period of quickening on two occasions,
and on the third till her delivery; but there was never any fetor or
any affection of the gums.<a id='r935' /><a href='#f935' class='c013'><sup>[935]</sup></a> I have likewise met with a singular
case where spontaneous ptyalism accompanied an ulcerated sore
throat of the mercurio-syphilitic kind. The patient had taken mercury
to salivation about six months before coming under my care,
and got completely rid of both the sore throat and salivation. But
the sore throat returned, together with the salivation, two months
before I saw him, and the salivation continued for two months longer
to the extent of twenty or even thirty ounces daily,—the ulcer of
the throat during that interval being sometimes healed up, and again
returning as severely as ever. In three weeks more the discharge
rapidly diminished, and ceased. During all the time he was under
my care there was no fetor of the breath, and no redness, ulceration,
or sponginess of the gums. A singular account of an epidemic salivation
which occurred in connection with a continued tertian fever,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>has been given in an inaugural dissertation contained in one of Haller’s
Collections. The author, Quelmalz, says that the ptyalism
sometimes continued for three weeks, that it was in one instance as
great in extent as the most violent mercurial salivation, and that it
was accompanied by fetor, superficial ulceration of the mouth, pustules
on the tongue, relaxation of the gums, and looseness of the
teeth.<a id='r936' /><a href='#f936' class='c013'><sup>[936]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Salivation may likewise be produced by the influence of the
imagination. I have seen a singular example of this. A woman
who had a great aversion to calomel was taking it with digitalis for
a dropsical complaint. Some one having told her what she was
using, she immediately began to complain of soreness of the mouth,
salivated profusely, and even put on the expression of countenance
of a salivating person, although she had taken only two grains. On
being persuaded, however, that she had been misinformed, the discharge
ceased gradually in the course of one night. Two days afterwards
she was again told on good authority that calomel was contained
in her medicines, upon which the salivation began again and
was profuse. It did not last above twenty-four hours; but the symptoms
during that period resembled a commencing mercurial salivation
in every thing but the want of fetor and redness of the gums.</p>

<p class='c006'>In general, mercurial salivation may be easily distinguished from
all the preceding varieties by an experienced practitioner. If its
progress has been traced from the first appearance of brassy taste and
fetor to the formation of ulcers and supervention of ptyalism, no
attentive person can run any risk of mistaking it. Its characters are
also quite distinct at the time salivation just begins. The fetor of
the breath and sponginess and ulceration of the gums at this stage
distinguish it from every other affection. But if the state of the
mouth is not examined till the ulcers have existed several days, the
characters of the mercurial disorder are much more equivocal. They
cannot be distinguished, for example, from some forms of idiopathic
ulceration of the mouth connected with unsoundness of the constitution,
and characterized by extensive sloughing, ptyalism, and gangrenous
fetor.<a id='r937' /><a href='#f937' class='c013'><sup>[937]</sup></a> In particular they cannot be distinguished from the
effects of the disease called <i>cancrum oris</i>. A few years ago indeed
a London physician was charged, in consequence of this resemblance,
with having killed, by mercurial salivation, a patient to whom it was
proved that he had not given a particle of mercury, and who clearly
died of the disease in question;<a id='r938' /><a href='#f938' class='c013'><sup>[938]</sup></a> and a similar case, where fatal
mercurial salivation was suspected, but which was clearly proved on
a Coroner’s Inquest to have been also a case of cancrum oris, has
been more lately published by Mr. Dunn.<a id='r939' /><a href='#f939' class='c013'><sup>[939]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>For distinguishing these and such other affections from mercurial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>salivation Dr. Davidson of Glasgow has lately proposed a character,
the exact scope of which cannot yet be appreciated,—namely, that
in true mercurial salivation there is never any sulpho-cyanic acid in
the saliva; so that sesquichloride of iron does not render it red.
The presence of sulpho-cyanic acid may possibly prove that salivation
is not mercurial; but the converse does not hold good, because
other causes tend to deprive human saliva of its sulpho-cyanic acid.<a id='r940' /><a href='#f940' class='c013'><sup>[940]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The next point to be noticed regarding mercurial salivation is,
that a long interval may elapse after the administration of the mercury
has been abandoned, before the effect on the salivary glands
and mouth begins,—mercury in small doses being what is called a
cumulative poison, or a poison whose influence accumulates silently
for some time in the body before its symptoms break forth. Swédiaur
has met with instances where the interval was several months,<a id='r941' /><a href='#f941' class='c013'><sup>[941]</sup></a>
Cullerier with a case in which it was three months.<a id='r942' /><a href='#f942' class='c013'><sup>[942]</sup></a> It will at once
be seen how strongly such facts may bear on the evidence in a criminal
case, where the administration of mercury in medicinal doses,
which have been long abandoned, is brought forward to account for
salivation, appearing weeks or months after, and giving rise, in conjunction
with other circumstances, to a suspicion of mercurial
poisoning of more recent date.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another question which has been made the subject of discussion is
the duration of mercurial ptyalism. The medical witness may be
required to give his opinion how long this affection may last after
the administration of mercury has been abandoned. The present
question may be cut short by stating, that there appears to be hardly
any limit to its possible duration. Linnæus met with an instance of
its continuing inveterately for a whole year;<a id='r943' /><a href='#f943' class='c013'><sup>[943]</sup></a> Swédiaur says he has
known persons languish for months and years from its effects;<a id='r944' /><a href='#f944' class='c013'><sup>[944]</sup></a> and
M. Colson knew an individual who had been salivated for six years.<a id='r945' /><a href='#f945' class='c013'><sup>[945]</sup></a>
These, however, are very rare incidents. After an ordinary mercurial
course the mouth and salivary glands generally return to the
healthy state in the course of a fortnight or three weeks.</p>

<p class='c006'>A fifth question, whether the ptyalism, or, speaking in general
terms, the erethysm of mercury, is susceptible of a complete intermission,
formed a material subject of inquiry, and the cause of much
contradictory statement on a noted criminal trial, that of Miss Butterfield
in 1775 for the murder of her master, Mr. Scawen. She was
accused of administering corrosive sublimate; and it was alleged in
her defence, that the salivation and consequent sloughing of which
he died might have arisen, without the fresh administration of mercury,
from the renewal of a previous ptyalism, which had been
brought on by a common mercurial course, and had ceased two
months before the second salivation began. It appeared that Mr.
Scawen was salivated with a quack medicine from the beginning till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>the middle of April; and that about the middle of June he was again
seized with violent salivation, of which he died. It was rendered
very improbable, that during the interval between the two salivations
any more mercury had been taken medicinally. The question then
was, whether the original ptyalism could have reappeared after so
long an interval, without the fresh administration of mercury? The
witnesses for the prosecution, gentlemen in extensive practice, said it
could not. But one of the prisoner’s witnesses, Mr. Bloomfield of
the London Lock Hospital, said he had repeatedly known salivation
reappear after a long intermission; that it was quite common for hospital
patients to have a second salivation, when thought well enough
to go out the next dismissal day;<a id='r946' /><a href='#f946' class='c013'><sup>[946]</sup></a> that in one case the interval was
three months; and that one of his patients was attacked periodically
with salivation at intervals of six weeks or a month for a whole year.
Mr. Howard, another surgeon of the Lock Hospital, deposed to the
same effect; and the prisoner was acquitted, apparently upon their
evidence.<a id='r947' /><a href='#f947' class='c013'><sup>[947]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Notwithstanding what was said by these gentlemen, I believe the
recurrence of mercurial salivation after so long an interval, without the
repetition of mercury, is exceedingly rare. Dr. Gordon Smith, in
alluding to the trial of Miss Butterfield, has mentioned a case which
occurred to the late Dr. Hamilton of this University, and used to be
related by him in his lectures. The interval was so great as four
months.<a id='r948' /><a href='#f948' class='c013'><sup>[948]</sup></a> Mr. Green of Bristol has lately described another unequivocal
case, where the interval was six weeks.<a id='r949' /><a href='#f949' class='c013'><sup>[949]</sup></a> Dr. Mead says
he met with an instance where the interval was six months;<a id='r950' /><a href='#f950' class='c013'><sup>[950]</sup></a> and
Dr. Male mentions another where mercury brought on moderate salivation
in March, and after a long interval excited a fresh salivation
in October, of which his patient died in a few weeks.<a id='r951' /><a href='#f951' class='c013'><sup>[951]</sup></a> M. Louyer-Villermé
met with a case, where, in consequence of exposure to cold,
a sudden attack of salivation was caused a twelvemonth after the
removal of syphilis by mercury.<a id='r952' /><a href='#f952' class='c013'><sup>[952]</sup></a> Some other cases not less wonderful
have been recorded by M. Colson in his paper on the effects of
mercury. He quotes Dr. Fordyce for the case of a man who had
repeated attacks of salivation, with metallic taste, which lasted for
three weeks, although mercury had not been taken for twelve years;
and Colson himself knew a surgeon who had a regular and violent
attack of all the symptoms of mercurialism eight years after he had
ceased to take mercury.<a id='r953' /><a href='#f953' class='c013'><sup>[953]</sup></a> It is impossible to attach credit to such
marvellous stories as the last two. Granting the ptyalism to be really
mercurial, it would require much better evidence than any practitioner
could procure, to determine the fact that mercury had not been given
again during the supposed interval. This objection indeed will apply
more or less even to the instances where the alleged interval did not
exceed a few months.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>The last point to be noticed regarding mercurial salivation is the
manner in which it proves fatal. Death may ensue from the mildest
preparations, and from the smallest doses, in consequence of severe
salivation being produced by them in peculiar habits. Two instances
have been already mentioned which illustrate both of these statements,
and others might easily be referred to were the fact not familiar.</p>

<p class='c006'>Death may be owing to a variety of causes. Some of those which
have been assigned are direct and unquestionable in their operation;
others indirect and more doubtful.</p>

<p class='c006'>The most direct and obvious manner is by extensive spreading
gangrene of the throat, mouth, face, and neck. The late happy
changes, introduced into the treatment of syphilis and other diseases
which are benefited by mercury, render this mode of death rare in
the present day. Yet I may mention that I have seen an example of
it in a woman who was salivated to death, because her medical attendant,
a firm believer in the powers of mercury as an antidote,
forgot that the antidote is itself a poison, if not given in moderation.
In general, when gangrene is the cause of death, it begins within the
mouth or in the throat, and spreads from that till it even reaches the
face. But sometimes it begins at once on the external surface, at
a distance from the primary ulcers. An example of such a progress
of the symptoms has been related by Dr. Grattan. A child ten years
old was violently salivated by twenty grains of calomel given in six
days. On the fifth day of the salivation, a little vesicle appeared on
the skin near the mouth on each side, and was the commencement of
a gangrenous ulcer, which spread over the whole cheek, and proved
fatal eight days after its appearance.<a id='r954' /><a href='#f954' class='c013'><sup>[954]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Another cause of death appears to be exhaustion from profuse and
protracted discharge of saliva, without material injury of the mouth
or adjoining organs.</p>

<p class='c006'>A third manner of death which I have witnessed is exhaustion
from laryngeal phthisis; and from the circumstances of the case, I
have little doubt but, in the state to which patients are then sometimes
reduced, death may also take place suddenly from suffocation.
My patient had undergone before I saw him five long salivations for
a venereal complaint, and had latterly been attacked with symptoms
of ulceration of the glottis. This affection went on slowly increasing,
and he died of exhaustion after many weeks of suffering. During
this period he was repeatedly attacked with alarming fits of suffocation,
which were relieved by the hawking of mucous flakes. The
symptoms were explained on dissection by the appearance of extensive
ulceration and thickening of the glottis, and almost total
destruction of the epiglottis.</p>

<p class='c006'>The other causes of death are more indirect, and will be mentioned
presently. They depend on the pre-existence of other diseases, on
which mercury acts deleteriously during the state of erethysm excited
by it in the constitution.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of Mercurial Tremor.</i>—The second division of the secondary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>effects of mercury comprehends the palsy or tremor, with the collateral
disorders induced in miners, gilders, and other workmen,
whose trade exposes them to the operation of this poison. Under
the present head, which might be treated at considerable length as
an important branch of medical police, I shall confine myself chiefly
to an analysis of an interesting essay by Mérat on the <i>Tremblement
Metallique</i>, and to some remarks by Jussieu on the health of the quicksilver
miners of Almaden in Spain.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mérat’s account of the shaking palsy induced by mercury is very
interesting.<a id='r955' /><a href='#f955' class='c013'><sup>[955]</sup></a> The disease, he states, may sometimes begin suddenly;
but in general it makes its approaches by slow steps. The first
symptom is unsteadiness of the arms, then quivering, finally tremors,
the several movements of which become more and more extensive
till they resemble convulsions, and render it difficult or impossible
for the patient to walk, to speak, or even to chew. All voluntary
motions, such as carrying a morsel to the mouth, are effected by several
violent starts. The arms are generally attacked first and also
most severely. If the man does not now quit work, loss of memory,
sleeplessness, delirium, and death ensue. But as the nature of the
disease soon renders working almost impossible, he cannot well continue;
and in that case death is rare. The concomitant symptoms of
the trembling are a peculiar brown tint of the whole body, dry skin,
flatus, but no colic, no disorder of respiration, and, except in very
old cases, no wasting or impaired digestion. The pulse is almost
always slow.—This description agrees with a somewhat later account
of the disease by Dr. Bateman, as he observed it in mirror-silverers;<a id='r956' /><a href='#f956' class='c013'><sup>[956]</sup></a>
and also with some interesting cases recently published
by Dr. Bright.<a id='r957' /><a href='#f957' class='c013'><sup>[957]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In general the tremors are cured easily, though slowly, several
months being commonly required. One of Dr. Bright’s patients got
almost well in little more than a fortnight under the use of sulphate
of zinc. Sometimes, however, the trembling is incurable.<a id='r958' /><a href='#f958' class='c013'><sup>[958]</sup></a> I have
said the disease is rarely fatal. Mérat quotes three cases only, in one
of which death was owing to profuse salivation and gangrene, in the
others to marasmus. On the whole, those who are liable to the
shaking palsy do not appear liable to salivation. Yet the two affections
are sometimes conjoined, as in three of the cases described
by Dr. Bright, and in some noticed by Mr. Mitchell among the mirror-silverers
of London.<a id='r959' /><a href='#f959' class='c013'><sup>[959]</sup></a> Gilders, miners, and barometer-makers
are all subject to the disease. Even those who undergo mercurial
frictions may have it, according to Mérat; and M. Colson, who confirms
this statement, quotes Swédiaur as another authority for it.<a id='r960' /><a href='#f960' class='c013'><sup>[960]</sup></a> It
is not merely long-continued exposure to mercurial preparations that
causes the shaking palsy: a single strong exposure may be sufficient;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>and the same exposure may cause tremor in one and salivation in
another. Professor Haidinger of Vienna some time ago mentioned
to me an accident a barometer-maker of his acquaintance met with,
which illustrates both of these statements. This man and one of his
workmen were exposed one night during sleep to the vapours of
mercury from a pot on a stove, in which a fire had been accidentally
kindled. They were both most severely affected, the latter with
salivation, which caused the loss of all his teeth, the former with
shaking palsy, which lasted his whole life.</p>

<p class='c006'>In regard to all such workmen, it is exceedingly probable that with
proper care the evils of their trade may be materially diminished.
This appears at least to be the result of the observations made long
ago by Jussieu on the miners of Almaden in La Mancha. Most
quicksilver mines are noted for great mortality among the workmen.
But Jussieu maintains that the trade is not by any means so necessarily
or so dreadfully unhealthy as is represented, or as it really is in
some places. The free workmen at Almaden, he says, by taking
care on leaving the mine to change their whole dress, particularly
their shoes, preserved their health, and lived as long as other people;
but the poor slaves, who could not afford a change of raiment, and
who took their meals in the mine, generally without even washing
their hands, were subject to swelling of the parotids, aphthous sore
throat, salivation, pustular eruptions, and tremors.<a id='r961' /><a href='#f961' class='c013'><sup>[961]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of the indirect effects of mercurial erethysm.</i>—The last division of
the secondary effects of mercury relates to its indirect action when
concurring with other diseases or predispositions to disease.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of these effects there are some of which the poison appears to be
the chief, if not even the sole cause. Thus, during the symptomatic
fever which precedes salivation there are sometimes remarked imitative
inflammations, or coma, or affections of the heart, which go
off as salivation is established.</p>

<p class='c006'>Other effects require the distinct co-operation of collateral causes.
Many inflammatory diseases, not easily excited in ordinary circumstances,
arise readily from improper exposures during salivation, for
example dropsy, pneumonia, phrenitis, iritis, erysipelas, and various
chronic eruptions.</p>

<p class='c006'>Other effects again require the co-operation of disease, such as
sloughing gangrene supervening on ordinary ulcers during the action
of mercury,—a not uncommon accident. This appears most likely
to happen when the ulcers are constitutional.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lastly, in conjunction with other diseased morbid actions, either
going on at the same time, or immediately preceding mercurial erethysm,
this poison is apt to occasion some modifications of disease
which are rarely otherwise witnessed. Modifications of the kind
have already been traced in the instances of lues venerea and scrofula;
but there is reason to believe that the same singular property
may also exist in relation to other constitutional disorders.</p>

<p class='c006'>These observations conclude the inquiry into the symptoms caused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>in man by mercurial poisons generally. Returning now to its mode
of action, we have to examine its relative effects through the different
animal textures, and in its various chemical forms.</p>

<p class='c006'>The result of the previous remarks as to its action on animals, it
will be remembered, was, that its soluble preparations cause when
swallowed corrosion of the stomach, and in whatever way it enters
the body irritation of the stomach and rectum, inflammation of the
lungs, depressed action and perhaps inflammation of the heart, oppression
of the functions of the brain, and inflammation of the salivary
glands. All of these effects have likewise been mentioned in the
preceding sketch, as occurring in a greater or less degree in consequence
of its operation on man.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mercury acts as a poison on man in whatever way it is introduced
into the body,—whether it be swallowed, or inhaled in the form of
vapour, or applied to a wound, or even simply rubbed or placed on
the sound skin. But the kind of action excited differs according to
the channel by which it is introduced.</p>

<p class='c006'>The most ordinary and dangerous cases of poisoning arise from the
introduction of corrosive sublimate into the stomach. The poison
then kills by corroding or inflaming the alimentary canal, or by
causing salivation and its concomitants.</p>

<p class='c006'>When applied to a wound or ulcer corrosive sublimate does not
often occasion dangerous symptoms. Yet it is sometimes a hazardous
remedy. It is not a convenient escharotic even in a concentrated
state; for its escharotic action is not incompatible with its
absorption; at all events it certainly sometimes acts constitutionally
through the surface of wounds and ulcers, and the symptoms
brought on in this way are generally violent. They are the symptoms
of mercurial salivation, accompanied at times with well-marked
inflammation of the alimentary canal. When applied to sores in a diluted
state it has also been known to cause dangerous effects if too
long persevered in. A case of the kind has been related by Mr. Robertson,
an army-surgeon. After anointing an itchy eruption of the
arms for seven days with a solution of corrosive sublimate containing
five grains to the ounce, his patient was attacked with fever, inflammation
of the stomach and bowels, and in two days more with violent
salivation.<a id='r962' /><a href='#f962' class='c013'><sup>[962]</sup></a> A case of the same nature has been related by Mr.
Sutleffe.<a id='r963' /><a href='#f963' class='c013'><sup>[963]</sup></a> His patient, a child, in consequence of having an eruption
of the head washed with a solution of corrosive sublimate, was attacked
with violent salivation, which proved fatal in a few days.
Pibrac has recorded three fatal cases from the free application of corrosive
sublimate to ulcerated surfaces. One of these proved fatal in
five days, another in twenty-four hours, and a third during the night
after the poison was applied. The symptoms generally indicated
violent action on the alimentary canal.<a id='r964' /><a href='#f964' class='c013'><sup>[964]</sup></a> In an instance mentioned
by Degner, fatal in twenty-five days, there was also violent irritation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>of the stomach; but the chief affection was excessive swelling of the
face and throat, together with profuse ptyalism.<a id='r965' /><a href='#f965' class='c013'><sup>[965]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>One of the readiest modes of bringing the system under the poisonous
action of mercury is by introducing its preparations into the
lungs. It appears from some experiments by Schlöpfer that the fluid
preparations act rapidly through the lining membrane of the air-passages.
Six grains of corrosive sublimate in solution will thus kill a
rabbit in five minutes.<a id='r966' /><a href='#f966' class='c013'><sup>[966]</sup></a> But the effects of mercury through this
channel are much better exemplified when its preparations are inhaled
in the form of vapour. Corrosive sublimate when incautiously
sublimed in chemical experiments has been known to cause serious
effects. Dr. Coldstream of Leith informs me, that while subliming
about twenty-four grains of it with the blowpipe when a student, he
and several of his fellow-apprentices were seized with painful constriction
of the throat, several had headache, and one had sickness
and vomiting. The phenomena produced by the various preparations
of mercury in more violent cases, are sometimes protracted
tremors,<a id='r967' /><a href='#f967' class='c013'><sup>[967]</sup></a> sometimes severe ptyalism and tedious dysentery,<a id='r968' /><a href='#f968' class='c013'><sup>[968]</sup></a> sometimes
salivation and gangrene of the mouth ending fatally.<a id='r969' /><a href='#f969' class='c013'><sup>[969]</sup></a> This
last form was produced remarkably in a chimney-sweeper, after cleaning
a gilder’s chimney, during which operation he felt a disagreeable
sense of tightness in the throat.</p>

<p class='c006'>Several extraordinary instances have happened of poisoning from
long-continued inhalation of the vapours which arise from metallic
mercury. That vapours do arise from metallic mercury of the ordinary
temperature of the atmosphere has been fully proved by Mr.
Faraday; who found, that when a bit of gold was suspended from
the top of a phial, the bottom being covered with a little mercury,
the gold soon became amalgamated.<a id='r970' /><a href='#f970' class='c013'><sup>[970]</sup></a> The vapours thus discharged
may produce the worst species of mercurialism, if they are diffused
through an apartment insufficiently ventilated. One of the most
striking examples known of the baneful effects of mercury thus gradually
insinuated into the system, occurred in a well-known accident
which befel the ships Triumph and Phipps. These vessels were
carrying home in 1810 a large quantity of quicksilver saved from
the wreck of a ship near Cadiz, when by some accident several of
the bags were burst and the mercury spilled. On the voyage home
the whole crews of both vessels were more or less severely salivated,
two died, many were dangerously ill, all the copper articles on board
became amalgamated, all the rats, mice, cockroaches, and other insects,
as well as a canary-bird and several fowls, and all larger
animals, such as cats, dogs, goats, and sheep were destroyed.<a id='r971' /><a href='#f971' class='c013'><sup>[971]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The action of mercury is often violently excited when it is applied
to the skin even not deprived of the cuticle. The effects of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>mercurial inunction form a well-known and satisfactory proof of
this. Even without the aid of infriction, the soluble preparations of
mercury will excite mercurial action by being put simply in contact
with the skin. Thus it has been shown by a German physician, Dr.
Guérard, that ptyalism may be induced by a warm bath of corrosive
sublimate in the proportion of an ounce to 48 quarts of water, and
that the effect commonly begins after the third bath with an interval
of three days between them.<a id='r972' /><a href='#f972' class='c013'><sup>[972]</sup></a> It is not so generally known that the
more active preparations, such as corrosive sublimate or nitrate of
mercury, may, like arsenic, cause through the sound skin effects almost
as violent as through the alimentary canal. The following
pointed illustration is related by Dr. Anderson. A gentleman affected
with rheumatism, was persuaded by a friend to use a nostrum,
which was nothing else than a solution of half a drachm of corrosive
sublimate in an ounce of rum. This was rubbed on the affected
part for several minutes before going to bed. Ere the friction
was ended, he felt a sensation of heat in the part, to which, however,
he paid little attention. But during the night he was attacked
with pain in the stomach, sickness, and vomiting, and soon after
with purging and tenesmus. In the morning Dr. Anderson found
him very weak and vomiting incessantly. The arm up to the shoulder
was prodigiously swelled, red, and blistered. Next day he
complained of brassy taste and tenderness of the gums, and regular
salivation soon succeeded.<a id='r973' /><a href='#f973' class='c013'><sup>[973]</sup></a> Another case of much interest has been
described by my colleague, Professor Syme, where a solution of the
nitrate was rubbed by mistake upon the hip and thigh instead of
camphorated oil. Intense pain immediately followed, and afterwards
shivering; the urine was suppressed for five days, without any insensibility,
and during its suppression urea was detected in the blood;
ptyalism appeared on the third day, became very profuse, and was
followed by exfoliation of the alveolar portion of the lower jaw, but
recovery nevertheless slowly took place.<a id='r974' /><a href='#f974' class='c013'><sup>[974]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The mere carrying of mercurial preparations for a length of time
near the skin, though not in direct contact with it, may be sufficient
to induce the peculiar effects of the poison, as the following example
will show. A man applied to a German physician, Dr. Scheel, affected
with violent salivation evidently mercurial which proved fatal,
but which it was impossible to trace to its real cause till after death,
when a little leathern bag containing a few drachms of mercury was
found hanging at his breast; and it was then discovered that he had
been in the practice of carrying this bag for six years as a protection
against itch and vermin, and during that period had frequent occasion
to renew the mercury.<a id='r975' /><a href='#f975' class='c013'><sup>[975]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The effects of mercury as a poison differ with the chemical form
in which it is introduced into the system.</p>

<p class='c006'>In its metallic state it is probably inactive. This fact is a material
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>one for the medical jurist to determine precisely; for running quicksilver
has been given with a criminal intent. A case of the kind forms
the subject of a medico-legal report in Pyl’s Repertory;<a id='r976' /><a href='#f976' class='c013'><sup>[976]</sup></a> and another
is mentioned in Klein’s Annals.<a id='r977' /><a href='#f977' class='c013'><sup>[977]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It is well ascertained that large quantities of fluid mercury have
been repeatedly swallowed, without any injury or peculiar effect having
followed. In neither of the German cases now referred to was
any bad effect produced; and it has proved equally harmless when
given medicinally to remove obstruction in the intestines. Farther,
M. Gaspard mentions in his paper quoted in a former page, that he
has left large quantities shut up for many hours in the various cavities
of the body in animals, without observing any other result
than at times inflammation, which was evidently owing to the
mere presence of a foreign body, and not to the action of an irritant
poison.<a id='r978' /><a href='#f978' class='c013'><sup>[978]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It has been already stated, however, that the vapours of metallic
mercury, even at the temperature of the air, produce mercurialism
when inhaled. But then, in all likelihood, some of the metal is oxidated
before being inhaled. At least the chemist knows that the surface
of a mercurial trough soon tarnishes, especially when the mercury
is not pure.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it may be said that the blue ointment, which is made with
running quicksilver, will not act as a mercurial when rubbed upon
the skin. Here too, however, some oxidation takes place in the
making of the ointment. Mr. Donovan endeavoured to prove that
some of the mercury is always oxidated;<a id='r979' /><a href='#f979' class='c013'><sup>[979]</sup></a> and I have generally found
a sufficient quantity of oxide to account for the effects.<a id='r980' /><a href='#f980' class='c013'><sup>[980]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It has been farther said, in proof of the poisonous action of quicksilver
in its metallic state,—that patients, who have taken it for obstructed
bowels, have sometimes been salivated. This accident has,
I believe, happened in a few instances where the mercury was retained
long in the body. But such cases are undoubtedly very rare.
Zwinger mentions the case of a man, who took four ounces for colic,
and was seized in seven days with salivation.<a id='r981' /><a href='#f981' class='c013'><sup>[981]</sup></a> Laborde relates the
particulars of another instance where seven ounces taken in fourteen
days excited ptyalism, ulceration of the mouth, and great feebleness
of the limbs.<a id='r982' /><a href='#f982' class='c013'><sup>[982]</sup></a> In the days of Dr. Dover, when the administration
of large doses of fluid mercury was a fashionable practice for a variety
of purposes, it was alleged to have even sometimes proved fatal;
and the case of an actor is specially mentioned, to whom, when convalescent
from ague, Dover gave mercury to the amount of two
pounds in five days, and who at the close of that period was seized
with headache, colic, restlessness, and costiveness, proving fatal in
two days; and the whole lower intestines were found black and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>lined with minute metallic globules.<a id='r983' /><a href='#f983' class='c013'><sup>[983]</sup></a> Perhaps then it must be admitted
that fluid mercury is not altogether inactive, speaking medicolegally.
But this admission is no argument in favour of the metal
being physiologically a poison; because in the course of the cases
referred to, a part is in all likelihood oxidated by the oxygen in
the intestinal gases. It is said to have been taken in the dose
of an ounce daily for nine months, without either good or harm resulting.<a id='r984' /><a href='#f984' class='c013'><sup>[984]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The question regarding the poisonous qualities of running quicksilver
was carefully investigated some years ago by the Berlin College
of Physicians in a report on the case in Pyl’s Repertory.<a id='r985' /><a href='#f985' class='c013'><sup>[985]</sup></a> They
observe that the opinion of Pliny, Galen, Hippocrates, Dioscorides,
and many of the earlier moderns, including even Zacchias, had led
to the popular belief in the deadly properties of fluid mercury; but
that this belief is erroneous; for many surgeons, and among the rest
Ambrose Paré, had given without injury to their patients several
pounds of it to cure obstructed bowels; and in 1515 the Margrave of
Brandenburg, over-heated on his marriage night with love and
wine, and rising to quench his thirst, drank by mistake a large
draught of quicksilver without suffering any harm. Fallopius mentions
that he had known instances of women swallowing pounds of
mercury, for the purpose of procuring miscarriage, and who did not
suffer any injury.<a id='r986' /><a href='#f986' class='c013'><sup>[986]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The sulphurets of mercury, like the metal, are not possessed of any
deleterious action on the animal body. Orfila found that half an ounce
of the sulphuret, formed in a solution of corrosive sublimate by sulphuretted-hydrogen,
and half an ounce or six drachms of cinnabar,
had no effect whatever on dogs.<a id='r987' /><a href='#f987' class='c013'><sup>[987]</sup></a> The sulphurets which have appeared
injurious in the hands of Smith<a id='r988' /><a href='#f988' class='c013'><sup>[988]</sup></a> and other previous experimentalists
must therefore have been impure.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of the compounds of mercury, the red-precipitate and Turbith-mineral
act as irritants, besides possessing the property common to
all mercurial compounds, of causing mercurial erethysm. But they
are not escharotics, though generally termed such. That is, they do
not chemically corrode the animal textures. The effects of red-precipitate
have been variable. Mr. Allison relates the case of a girl
who in a fit of jealousy swallowed thirty grains of it. Being immediately
detected, an emetic was given, which operated freely, and
subsequently the stomach-pump was used; but on neither occasion
was any red powder brought away. She was attacked with burning
pain in the stomach, which was removed by opium, and for a week
she had a distaste for food, but no other symptom of consequence.<a id='r989' /><a href='#f989' class='c013'><sup>[989]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>Mr. Brett has described a case, in which the symptoms were occasional
vomiting, stupor, languid pulse, cold clamminess of the skin,
afterwards severe cramps of the legs, tenderness of the abdomen,
dysuria, and some purging, and on the third day ptyalism; but the
patient recovered.<a id='r990' /><a href='#f990' class='c013'><sup>[990]</sup></a> M. Devergie has given a case somewhat similar,
but without any ptyalism having followed the irritant effects of
the poison.<a id='r991' /><a href='#f991' class='c013'><sup>[991]</sup></a> In 1840 I was consulted on the part of the Crown in
the case of a girl, who, there was every reason to suppose, had been
killed in twelve hours by red-precipitate. The symptoms towards
the close were pain in the throat, inability to swallow, vomiting, and
excessive prostration; extensive red patches were found on the
villous coat of the stomach after death; and I detected mercury in
the solid contents and likewise in the inner coat of the stomach. The
case did not go to trial, because, although a man by whom she was
pregnant came under some suspicion, it rather appeared that the
deceased had herself swallowed the poison with the view of inducing
miscarriage. Dr. Sobernheim has given the particulars of the
case of a young man who died from swallowing an ounce of red-precipitate.
He suffered for some hours from vomiting, diarrhœa,
pain in the stomach, tenderness of the belly, and colic; next day he
had no pain, but coldness, lividity, stiffness, and an imperceptible
pulse; and he expired in thirty-three hours. The poison was found
abundantly in the stomach and duodenum after death, and some
grains of it rested upon little ulcers.<a id='r992' /><a href='#f992' class='c013'><sup>[992]</sup></a> As to Turbith-mineral, two
scruples will kill a cat in four hours and a half; and several instances
of violent and even fatal poisoning with it are mentioned by the older
modern authors.<a id='r993' /><a href='#f993' class='c013'><sup>[993]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The white precipitate or chloride of mercury and ammonia is probably
also irritant, though inferior in power to the preparations just
mentioned. Two scruples given to a dog occasion vomiting, pain,
and some diarrhœa; and cases are recorded of death in the human
subject from less doses.<a id='r994' /><a href='#f994' class='c013'><sup>[994]</sup></a> But there are no recent facts as to the activity
of this compound, and the older cases, which would assign to
it very great energy, are open to the objection that this preparation
was in former times often impure.</p>

<p class='c006'>The bichloride or corrosive sublimate is a powerful corrosive or
irritant, according to the dose and state of concentration; and it also
excites mercurial erethysm in a violent degree. The nitrates too
are corrosive, and not inferior in activity to the bichloride, as may be
inferred from Dr. Bigsby’s case, noticed at page <a href='#Page_314'>314</a>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The bicyanide or prussiate of mercury, from the researches of
Ollivier, and an interesting case he has published of poisoning with
it in the human subject, appears to resemble corrosive sublimate
closely in all its effects, except that it does not corrode chemically.
Twenty-three grains and a half proved fatal in nine days.<a id='r995' /><a href='#f995' class='c013'><sup>[995]</sup></a> M. Thibert
has described a case in which ten grains caused death in the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>period of time.<a id='r996' /><a href='#f996' class='c013'><sup>[996]</sup></a> The symptoms in both instances were those of
severe irritation of the stomach, extensive inflammation of the organs
in the mouth, and suppression of urine; and in Thibert’s case a small
quantity of albuminous fluid was discharged from the bladder instead
of urine.</p>

<p class='c006'>The protochloride or calomel, and probably also the protoxide,
are the most manageable of the preparations of mercury for inducing
ptyalism. Calomel is also an irritant; that is, it causes irritation
and inflammation in the alimentary canal when swallowed. This
part of its properties as a poison will require a word or two of
explanation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Calomel is universally employed as a laxative, but to secure this
effect being produced it is commonly combined with other purgatives.
When given alone a few grains will in some constitutions induce a
violent hypercatharsis; and larger, but still moderate, doses have with
most people such a tendency to cause severe griping and diarrhœa as
to have led to the practice of combining it with opium when the object
is to salivate. These considerations clearly establish that calomel,
in a moderate dose of five or ten grains, is an irritant.</p>

<p class='c006'>It farther appears that in larger doses it is said to have occasionally
produced very violent effects, nay, even death itself, by its irritant
operation. Hoffmann has mentioned two instances where fifteen grains
of calomel proved fatal to boys between the ages of twelve and fifteen.
One of them had vomiting, tremors of the hands and feet, restlessness
and anxiety, and died on the sixth day. The other, he merely mentions,
died after suffering from extreme anxiety and black vomiting.<a id='r997' /><a href='#f997' class='c013'><sup>[997]</sup></a>
Another fatal case has been related by Ledelius in the German Ephemerides,
which was caused by a dose of half an ounce taken accidentally.
Vomiting soon ensued, and a sense of acridity in the throat;
then profuse diarrhœa to the extent of twenty evacuations in the day;
next excessive prostration of strength and torpor of the external senses;
and death followed in little more than twenty-four hours.<a id='r998' /><a href='#f998' class='c013'><sup>[998]</sup></a> Wibmer
quotes Vigetius, an author of the beginning of last century, for a similar
case, likewise fatal, which was occasioned by half an ounce,—also
Hellweg, a writer of the previous century, for the case of a physician,
who took an ordinary medicinal dose by way of experiment, and
died in five hours under all the symptoms of violent irritant poisoning.<a id='r999' /><a href='#f999' class='c013'><sup>[999]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>These observations being kept in view, what explanation will the
toxicologist give of the effects which in modern times have been
ascribed to large doses of calomel? It was stated not many years
ago by several East India surgeons, apparently with the universal
assent of their brethren in later times, that this drug in the dose of a
scruple administered even several times a day, is not only not an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>irritant, but even on the contrary a sedative;<a id='r1000' /><a href='#f1000' class='c013'><sup>[1000]</sup></a> and that in some diseases,
for example yellow fever, it has been given in the dose of five,
ten, or twenty grains, four or six times a day, till several hundred
grains were accumulated in the body, yet without causing hypercatharsis,
nay, with the effect of checking the irritation which gives
rise to black vomit in yellow fever, and to the vomiting and diarrhœa
observed in the cholera of the East. It is quite impossible for
a European physician to doubt these statements; for all practitioners
in hot climates concur in them, and now that analogous practices have
been transferred to Britain, repeated opportunities have occurred for
establishing the fidelity of the original reporters. Some American
physicians, advancing beyond the Hindostan treatment, have since
given calomel in bilious fever in the dose of forty grains, one drachm,
two drachms, and even three drachms, repeatedly in the course
of twenty-four hours for several days together,—and with similar
phenomena. In one instance 840 grains were given in the course of
eight days in these enormous doses. The largest dose was three
drachms; and it was followed by only one copious evacuation, and
that not till after the use of an injection.<a id='r1001' /><a href='#f1001' class='c013'><sup>[1001]</sup></a> This practice appears
not to have been altogether unknown in former times. Ledelius,
the author formerly quoted, states, that he had been accustomed to
give doses of a scruple, and that Zwölffer even gave a drachm in one
dose.<a id='r1002' /><a href='#f1002' class='c013'><sup>[1002]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It must be also added, that while the facts quoted above from
Hoffmann, Ledelius, and others assign to single large doses a
powerful and dangerous irritant action, very different results have
been occasionally observed in recent times where even so large
a quantity as one or two ounces had been taken. Thus, in the
case of a lady mentioned by Wibmer, who took by mistake the
enormous quantity of fourteen drachms, although acute pain in
the belly ensued, together with vomiting and purging, these symptoms
were speedily subdued by oleaginous demulcents; and after
a smart salivation, she recovered entirely in six weeks.<a id='r1003' /><a href='#f1003' class='c013'><sup>[1003]</sup></a> Another
case has been related by Mr. H. P. Robarts, where an
ounce was swallowed by a young lady by mistake for magnesia,
with no other effect than nausea at first, rather severe griping
and slight tenderness of the belly afterwards, and subsequently
languor, headache and indigestion; yet the powder was retained
two hours.<a id='r1004' /><a href='#f1004' class='c013'><sup>[1004]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It is impossible in the present place to enter into the physiological
action of calomel as a remedy; but every one must be satisfied that,
with all which has been already written, much still remains to be
done before the facts now mentioned can be explained satisfactorily.
Can the violent effects described by Hoffmann, Ledelius and Hellweg
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>have arisen from the calomel having been imperfectly prepared
and adulterated with a little corrosive sublimate? Or may they be
explained by reference to the fact, that the presence of hydrochlorates
in solution, particularly hydrochlorate of ammonia, tends to convert
calomel into corrosive sublimate.<a id='r1005' /><a href='#f1005' class='c013'><sup>[1005]</sup></a> Mr. Alfred Taylor has made
some experiments, to show that the latter explanation will not
suffice.<a id='r1006' /><a href='#f1006' class='c013'><sup>[1006]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Meanwhile, taking the facts as they stand, it is plain that great
caution must be used in ascribing violent irritant properties generally,
or even symptoms of irritant poisoning in a particular case, to large
doses of calomel.</p>

<p class='c006'>With the view of illustrating the importance of the preceding
observations, it may be useful to mention here the heads of a case
already briefly alluded to for another purpose, the trial of William
Paterson for murder (<a href='#Page_319'>319</a>).<a id='r1007' /><a href='#f1007' class='c013'><sup>[1007]</sup></a> His wife during the month
previous to her death had two attacks of diarrhœa, with an interval
of a fortnight between them. On the second occasion it became
profuse and exhausting, but without any material pain or
considerable vomiting; looseness of the teeth and salivation ensued,
and she died in nine days. On examination of the body,
the anus was found excoriated, the whole intestines checkered
with dark patches, and the stomach red, ulcerated, and spotted
with black, warty excrescences; but the late Dr. Cleghorn of
Glasgow could not detect any poison by chemical analysis. It
was proved that the prisoner, besides procuring, a few months
before his wife’s death, a variety of poisons, such as hydrochloric
acid, cantharides, and arsenic, had also on different occasions
during her last illness purchased in a suspicious manner four
doses of calomel varying from 30 to 60 grains each. Among
the various ways in which he was charged with having poisoned
the deceased, that which was best borne out by the general as
well as medical facts consisted in his taking advantage of an existing
inflammation of the mucous membrane of the bowels,—whether
arising from a natural cause or from poison it was in
this view of the case immaterial to inquire,—and keeping up and
aggravating the inflammation by purposely administering at intervals
large doses of calomel. On the trial Dr. Cleghorn and
other witnesses gave their opinion that the doses purchased by
the prisoner, if administered, would cause the symptoms and
morbid appearances observed in the case. On the other hand,
the late Dr. Gordon deposed to the effect, that all the symptoms
of the case might arise under the operation of natural disease,
and that such doses of calomel were by no means necessarily injurious;
the late Mr. John Bell deposed, that it had even been
given in much larger doses without injury; and the profession
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>are now well aware, though not at the time of this trial, that in
the very malady alleged by the prisoner to have carried off the
deceased, namely dysentery, the administration of calomel in repeated
large doses is accounted by many a proper method of
cure. The doses purchased by the prisoner were considerably
larger, it is true. But there was not any evidence of his having
administered his purchases in single doses as he got them; and
even though there had been evidence to that effect, it would not
remove altogether the difficulty of deciding the question, as to
the irritating action of calomel, on which the issue of the trial in
one view of the case chiefly depended.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is probable that all the compounds formed by corrosive sublimate
with animal and vegetable substances are feebly poisonous, or
at least very much inferior in activity to corrosive sublimate itself.
This has been shown by Orfila to be the case with the compound
formed by albumen. Sixty grains of this compound, being equivalent
to nearly five grains of corrosive sublimate, produced no bad
effect whatever on a dog or a rabbit.<a id='r1008' /><a href='#f1008' class='c013'><sup>[1008]</sup></a> The same has been satisfactorily
proved by Taddei as to the compound formed by gluten.
Twelve grains of corrosive sublimate decomposed by his emulsion of
gluten had no effect whatever on a dog.<a id='r1009' /><a href='#f1009' class='c013'><sup>[1009]</sup></a> It is important to remark,
however, that if there be an excess of the decomposing principle, so
that the precipitate is party redissolved, the irritant action of the corrosive
sublimate is not so much reduced, though it is still certainly
diminished. Orfila has settled this point in regard to albumen.<a id='r1010' /><a href='#f1010' class='c013'><sup>[1010]</sup></a>
The power of producing mercurial erethysm is possessed by all
mercurial compounds whatever, and among the rest by the compounds
now under consideration.<a id='r1011' /><a href='#f1011' class='c013'><sup>[1011]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The present section may now be concluded with a few remarks
on the strength of the evidence derived from the symptoms which
are produced by the compounds of mercury.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the medical jurist should meet with a case of sudden death like
that of the animals experimented on by Sir B. Brodie, the symptoms
alone could not constitute any evidence of poisoning with corrosive
sublimate. All he could say would be that this variety of poisoning
was possible, but that various natural diseases might have the same
effect. This feebleness in the evidence from symptoms, however, is
of little moment; because the dose must be great to cause such
symptoms, and little can be vomited before death; so that the poison
will be certainly found in the stomach.</p>

<p class='c006'>Should the patient die under symptoms of general irritation in the
alimentary canal, poisoning may be suspected. But it would be impossible
to derive from them more than presumptive evidence. The
suspicion must become strong, however, if the ordinary signs of irritation
in the alimentary canal are attended with the discharge of blood
upwards and downwards. And the presumption will, I apprehend,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>approach very near to certainty,—at least of the administration
of some active irritant poison,—if, at the moment of swallowing
a suspected article, and but a short time before the symptoms of
irritation began in the stomach and bowels, the patient should have
remarked a strong, acrid, metallic taste, and constriction or burning
in the throat.</p>

<p class='c006'>When upon all these symptoms salivation is superinduced, the
evidence of poisoning with corrosive sublimate or some other soluble
salt of mercury is almost unequivocal. That is, if, after something
has been taken which tasted acrid, and caused an immediate sense
of heat, pricking, or tightness in the throat, the characteristic signs of
poisoning with the irritants make their appearance in the usual time,
and are soon after accompanied or followed by true mercurial salivation,—it
may be safely inferred that some soluble compound of
mercury has been taken. Before drawing this inference, however,
it will be necessary to determine with precision all the classes of
symptoms, more particularly the nature of the salivation. It should
also be remembered that salivation may accompany or follow the
symptoms of inflammation in the stomach, in consequence of calomel
having been used as a remedy. But if proper attention be paid to
the fallacies in the way of judgment, I conceive that an opinion on
the question of poisoning with corrosive sublimate may be sometimes
rested on the symptoms alone. This is another exception
to the rule laid down by most modern toxicologists and medical
jurists respecting the validity of the evidence of poisoning from
symptoms.</p>

<p class='c006'>For a good example of the practical application of these precepts,
the reader may consult the trial of Mr. Hodgson, for attempting to
poison his wife. In the instance which gave rise to the trial in
question, a violent burning sensation in the throat was felt during
the act of swallowing some pills; in the course of ten minutes violent
vomiting ensued, afterwards severe burning pain along the whole
course of the gullet down to the stomach, next morning diarrhœa,
and on the third day ptyalism. There were many other points of
medical evidence which left no doubt that corrosive sublimate was
swallowed in the pills. But even the history of the symptoms alone
would have led to that inference.<a id='r1012' /><a href='#f1012' class='c013'><sup>[1012]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section III.</span>—<i>Of the Morbid Appearances caused by Mercury.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The morbid appearances observed in the bodies of persons killed
by corrosive sublimate will not require many details; since most of
the remarks formerly made under the head of the pathology of the
irritants generally, and of arsenic in particular, apply with equal
force to the present species of poisoning. Still there are some peculiarities
deserving of notice, which arise from the greater solubility
or stronger irritant action of corrosive sublimate.</p>

<p class='c006'>The mouth and throat are more frequently affected than by arsenic;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>and a remarkable appearance sometimes observed, and not excited,
so far as I know, by arsenic, is shrivelling of the tongue, with great
enlargement of the papillæ at its root.<a id='r1013' /><a href='#f1013' class='c013'><sup>[1013]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The disorder of the alimentary canal is also usually more general,
and reaches a greater height before death takes place. Sometimes the
irritation and organic injury are confined to the stomach;<a id='r1014' /><a href='#f1014' class='c013'><sup>[1014]</sup></a> but more
commonly the throat, stomach, gullet, rectum, nay, even also the colon,
are affected. The black or melanotic extravasation into the mucous
membrane of the stomach, which has been already several times described
as a common effect of the more violent irritants, is also produced
by corrosive sublimate. In Devergie’s case and in that of Dr.
Venables it was present in a very great degree.<a id='r1015' /><a href='#f1015' class='c013'><sup>[1015]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The coats of the stomach, and also those of the intestines, more
particularly the colon and rectum, have frequently been found destroyed.
So far as I have been able to ascertain, two kinds of destruction
of the coats may be met with,—corrosion and ulceration.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first is the result of chemical decomposition of the tissues.
This kind is evidently to be looked for only when the quantity has been
considerable and the dose concentrated. Nay even then it is rare.
For on account of the solubility of corrosive sublimate, the facility
with which it is decomposed by the secretions or accidental contents
of the stomach, and the violence and frequency of the vomiting, this
poison is peculiarly liable to be prevented from exerting its corrosive
action on the membranes. Hence it is that proper chemical corrosion
of the coats of the stomach is seldom witnessed in man.</p>

<p class='c006'>The appearance of this corrosion differs according to the rapidity
of the poisoning. In very rapid cases, for example in animals which
have survived only twenty-five minutes, the villous coat has a dark gray
appearance, without any sign of vital reaction.<a id='r1016' /><a href='#f1016' class='c013'><sup>[1016]</sup></a> But this variety
has never been witnessed in man, in whom the action has been
hitherto much less rapid. In the most rapid cases, such as that of
Dr. Bigsby, which terminated in two hours and a half (<a href='#Page_314'>314</a>), or those
related by Mr. Valentine, of which one ended fatally in eleven and
another in twenty-four hours, the corrosion was black, like the charring
of “leather with a red-hot coal, and the rest of the stomach
scarlet-red or deep rose-red;—showing that inflammation had set
in.” In the former of these two cases the corrosion was as big as a
half-crown, in the latter three inches in diameter. In a third case,
where the patient lived thirty-one hours, the stomach was perforated.<a id='r1017' /><a href='#f1017' class='c013'><sup>[1017]</sup></a>
In the case described by Dr. Venables, and formerly alluded to,
where life was prolonged for eight days, there was a patch on the
under surface of the stomach as large as two crown-pieces, hard,
elevated, and of a very dark olive or almost black colour, besides very
general erosion of the villous coat.<a id='r1018' /><a href='#f1018' class='c013'><sup>[1018]</sup></a> In all these cases the disintegrated
spot was probably situated where the poison first chiefly lodged.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>The corrosion caused by mercury, if examined before the slough is
thrown off, will be found to possess an important peculiarity: the
disorganized tissue yields mercury by chemical analysis. Professor
Taddei repeatedly obtained the metal from the membranes of animals
which he had poisoned with corrosive sublimate.<a id='r1019' /><a href='#f1019' class='c013'><sup>[1019]</sup></a> It is probable
that mercury may be thus detected although death may not have
taken place for some time after the poison was swallowed. For the
slough was found adhering in one of Mr. Valentine’s cases, where life
was prolonged for seventy hours; and it was not entirely removed
even in eight days in one of the cases described by Dr. Venables.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although, however, it is sometimes possible to find the poison in the
stomach, the medical jurist must not perhaps expect to find it so often
in the present instance as in that of poisoning with arsenic. For on
account of its greater solubility corrosive sublimate cannot adhere
with such obstinacy to the villous coat, and is therefore more subject
to be discharged by vomiting. Nevertheless, the insoluble
compound formed by antidotes may adhere to the coats like arsenic,
and so resist the tendency of vomiting to displace them. In Devergie’s
case, notwithstanding twenty-three hours of incessant vomiting,
although no poison could be detected in the fluid contents of the stomach,
it was distinctly found in small whitish masses that lay between
the folds of the rugæ.<a id='r1020' /><a href='#f1020' class='c013'><sup>[1020]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It may be here farther observed that corrosive sublimate, as well
as other salts of mercury, may undergo in the alimentary canal after
death the same change which is produced in arsenic from the gradual
action of hydrosulphuric acid gas. It may be converted into the sulphuret.
I am not acquainted indeed with any actual instance of
such conversion; but that it may occur we can scarcely doubt, not
merely from theoretical considerations, but likewise because Orfila
met with an instance where calomel taken daily in a case of
gastro-cephalitis was discharged by stool in the form of a black sulphuret.<a id='r1021' /><a href='#f1021' class='c013'><sup>[1021]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Another important consideration is, that corrosive sublimate may
be decomposed and reduced to the metallic state by the admixture of
various substances either given at the same time or subsequently,
and the longer the inspection is delayed, the more complete will be
the decomposition which is accomplished. Iron, zinc, and other
metals are the most active of these substances.<a id='r1022' /><a href='#f1022' class='c013'><sup>[1022]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The other forms of destruction of the coats of the alimentary canal
is common ulceration, either such from the beginning, or what was
originally corrosion converted into an ulcer in consequence of the
disorganized spot being thrown off by sloughing.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have seen this appearance to an enormous extent in the great
intestines of a man who survived nine days. Numerous large, black,
gangrenous ulcers, just like those observed in bad cases of dysentery,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>were scattered over the whole colon and rectum. In this instance,
which occurred to the late Dr. Shortt, the stomach was also ulcerated,
but the small intestines were not.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sometimes the ulceration seems to be a variety of softening of the
mucous tissue, as in a case described by Dr. Alexander Wood of
this city, which proved fatal in fourteen days, and in which the
stomach, cæcum, and ascending colon presented round, softened,
greenish spots about the size of a sixpence, and accompanied in the
stomach with a tendency to detaching of the membrane in the form of
a slough.<a id='r1023' /><a href='#f1023' class='c013'><sup>[1023]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The destruction of the villous coat of the stomach occasioned by
corrosive sublimate and other soluble salts of mercury may be distinguished
from spontaneous gelatinization by one of two characters.
If the slough remains attached, mercury will be detected in it: if
separation has taken place, the ulcer exposed presents surrounding
redness and other signs of reaction.<a id='r1024' /><a href='#f1024' class='c013'><sup>[1024]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>All the other effects of inflammation may be produced by corrosive
sublimate, as by arsenic and other irritants. More frequently here
than in the case of arsenic peritonæal inflammation is met with. In
Devergie’s case the external surface of the stomach along both its
curvatures presented the appearance of red points on a violet ground.
In Mr. Valentine’s cases there was much minute vascularity, not only
of the outside of the stomach but also of the whole peritonæum lining
the viscera and inside of the abdomen; and there was even some
serous effusion into the cavity. In Dr. Venables’s case the peritonæal
coat of the stomach was highly vascular and inflamed, and the
omentum also injected.</p>

<p class='c006'>The urinary organs, and particularly the kidneys, are often much
inflamed by poisoning with corrosive sublimate. Dr. Henry has related
a case in which this poison proved fatal on the ninth day, and
where the left kidney was found to contain an abscess.<a id='r1025' /><a href='#f1025' class='c013'><sup>[1025]</sup></a> In all of
Mr. Valentine’s cases the kidneys were inflamed, and the bladder
excessively contracted, so as not to exceed the size of a walnut. In
Ollivier’s case, caused by the cyanide of mercury, the scrotum was
gorged and black, the penis erected, and the kidneys a third larger
than natural. In the case described by Dr. Venables both kidneys,
but especially the left, were large, flaccid, and vascular, the ureters
turgid and purple, and the bladder contracted, empty, and red internally.</p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila has observed that the internal membrane of the heart is
sometimes inflamed and checkered with brownish-black spots. Some
remarks have been already made on the light in which this appearance
ought to be viewed by the pathologist (p. <a href='#Page_271'>271</a>).</p>

<p class='c006'>Whatever may be the real state of the fact as to the alleged power
of arsenic to preserve from decay the bodies of those poisoned with
it, all authors agree that corrosive sublimate possesses no such property.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>Yet it is well known to be a good antiseptic, when applied
topically. The experiments of Klanck, noticed under the head of
Arsenic, prove that corrosive sublimate at all events does not retard
putrefaction in the bodies of those poisoned with it; and Augustin
in his analysis of Klanck’s researches infers that it even promotes
decay.<a id='r1026' /><a href='#f1026' class='c013'><sup>[1026]</sup></a> I have met with one example in the human subject which
seems to confirm Augustin’s opinion. In the case formerly quoted
from the Medical and Physical Journal, which was fatal in four days,
the relater found the body forty-two hours after death so putrid,
though in the month of January, that the examination of it was very
unpleasant, the belly being black, and a very offensive odour being
exhaled.<a id='r1027' /><a href='#f1027' class='c013'><sup>[1027]</sup></a> Little importance, however, can be attached to a solitary
case; for on the contrary Sallin relates a case where the body of a
man supposed to have been poisoned with corrosive sublimate was
found not decayed, but imperfectly mummified, after sixty-seven
days.<a id='r1028' /><a href='#f1028' class='c013'><sup>[1028]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It is unnecessary to detail the proofs to be found in the dead body
of mercurial salivation having existed during life. They are of
course to be looked for in the mouth, and in the adjoining organs.
We must not, however, expect to see much appearance of disease in
the salivary glands; for according to Cruveilhier, in persons who
die of mercurial salivation these glands do not present any trace of
inflammation themselves, but merely serous effusion into the cellular
tissue around them.<a id='r1029' /><a href='#f1029' class='c013'><sup>[1029]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Professor Orfila has made some useful experiments as to the effects
of corrosive sublimate on dead intestine, which it may be proper to
notice in a few words. When applied in the form of powder to the
rectum of an animal newly killed, the part with which it is in contact
becomes wrinkled, and as it were granulated, harder than natural,
and of alabaster whiteness, intermingled with rose-red streaks, apparently
the ramifications of vessels. When the membrane is stretched
upon the finger, the wrinkling disappears. The muscular coat is of
a snow-white colour, and even the serous coat is white, opaque, and
thickened. The parts not in contact with the powder retain their
natural appearance, and the line of demarcation between the affected
and unaffected portions is abrupt. If the powder is not applied till
twenty-four hours after death, the parts it touches become thick,
white, and hard; but no red lines are visible. It is easy to draw
the distinction between these appearances and the effects of corrosive
sublimate during life.</p>

<p class='c006'>Little need be said of the force of the evidence of poisoning with
corrosive sublimate, derived from the morbid appearances. If the
gullet, stomach, and colon be all inflamed and ulcerated, and these
injuries have taken place during a short illness, the presumption in
favour of some form of irritant poisoning will be strong. And the
presumption of poisoning with corrosive sublimate will be strong, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>the usual marks of salivation are also found in the mouth and throat.
But such evidence can never amount to more than a strong presumption
or probability.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section IV.</span>—<i>Of the Treatment of Poisoning with Mercury.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The treatment of poisoning by the compounds of mercury may be
referred to two heads,—that which is required when irritation of
the alimentary canal is the prominent disorder, and that which is
designed to remove mercurial salivation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Irritation and inflammation of the alimentary canal are to be treated
nearly in the same way as when arsenic has been the poison swallowed.
In the instance of corrosive sublimate we also possess a
convenient and effectual antidote.</p>

<p class='c006'>Several substances may be used as antidotes; but those which
have hitherto been most employed are albumen and gluten.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been already hinted that albumen, in the form of white of
eggs beat up with water, impairs or destroys the corrosive properties
of bichloride of mercury, by decomposing it and producing an insoluble
mercurial compound. For this discovery and the establishment
of albumen as an antidote, medicine is indebted to Professor
Orfila. He has related many satisfactory experiments in proof of its
virtues. The following will serve as an example of the whole.
Twelve grains of corrosive sublimate were given to a little dog, and
allowed to act for eight minutes, so that its usual effects might fairly
begin before the antidote was administered. White of eight eggs
was then given; after several fits of vomiting the animal became
apparently free from pain; and in five days it was quite well.<a id='r1030' /><a href='#f1030' class='c013'><sup>[1030]</sup></a> According
to Peschier the white of one egg is required to render four
grains of the poison innocuous.<a id='r1031' /><a href='#f1031' class='c013'><sup>[1031]</sup></a> The experiments of the Parisian
toxicologist have been repeated and confirmed by others and particularly
by Schloepfer; who found that when a dose was given to a
rabbit sufficient to kill it in seven minutes if allowed to act uncontrolled,
the administration of albumen, just as the signs of uneasiness
appeared, prevented every serious symptom.<a id='r1032' /><a href='#f1032' class='c013'><sup>[1032]</sup></a> Dr. Samuel Wright
has found that if the administration of albumen is followed up by
giving some astringent decoction or infusion, the beneficial effects
are more complete, because the compound formed is less soluble in
an excess of albumen.<a id='r1033' /><a href='#f1033' class='c013'><sup>[1033]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The virtues of albumen have also been tried in the human subject
with equally favourable results. The recovery of the patient, whose
case was quoted formerly (p. <a href='#Page_312'>312</a>), from Orfila’s Toxicology, seems
to have been owing in great measure to this remedy. In the Medical
Repository another case is related, in which it Was also very serviceable.<a id='r1034' /><a href='#f1034' class='c013'><sup>[1034]</sup></a>
A third very apposite example of its good effects is related
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>by Dr. Lendrick. His patient had taken about half a drachm of
corrosive sublimate, and was attacked with most of the usual symptoms,
except vomiting. White of eggs was administered a considerable
time afterwards, the beneficial effects of which were instantaneous
and well-marked; and the patient recovered.<a id='r1035' /><a href='#f1035' class='c013'><sup>[1035]</sup></a> A few years
ago Orfila’s discovery was the means of saving the life of M. Thenard
the chemist. While at lecture, this gentleman inadvertently swallowed,
instead of water, a mouthful of a concentrated solution of
corrosive sublimate; but having immediately perceived the fatal
error, he sent for white of eggs, which he was fortunate enough to
procure in five minutes. Although at this time he had not vomited,
he suffered no material harm. Without the prompt use of the albumen,
he would almost infallibly have perished.<a id='r1036' /><a href='#f1036' class='c013'><sup>[1036]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Albumen is chiefly useful in the early stage of poisoning with
corrosive sublimate, and is particularly called for when vomiting
does not take place. But it farther appears to be an excellent demulcent
in the advanced stages.</p>

<p class='c006'>On a previous occasion, mention was made of a few of the facts
brought forward by Professor Taddei to prove the virtues of the
gluten of wheat as an antidote for poisoning with corrosive sublimate
[297, 336], so that nothing more need be said on the subject in
the present place. As it is difficult to bring the whole of a fluid
containing corrosive sublimate into speedy contact with pulverized
gluten, which when put into water becomes agglutinated into a mass,
the discoverer of this antidote proposes to give it in the form of emulsion
with soft soap. This is made by mixing, partly in a mortar and
partly with the hand, five or six parts of fresh gluten with fifty parts
of a solution of soft soap. And in order to have a store always at
hand, this emulsion, after standing and being frequently stirred for
twenty-four hours, is to be evaporated to dryness in shallow vessels,
and reduced to powder. The powder may be converted into a
frothy emulsion in a few minutes.<a id='r1037' /><a href='#f1037' class='c013'><sup>[1037]</sup></a> Taddei made use of this powder
with complete success in the case of a man who had swallowed
seven grains of corrosive sublimate by mistake for calomel. Violent
symptoms followed the taking of the poison; but they were immediately
assuaged by the administration of the antidote; and the person
soon got quite well.<a id='r1038' /><a href='#f1038' class='c013'><sup>[1038]</sup></a> It is probable that wheat flour will prove
an effectual antidote by reason of the gluten it contains. On agitating
for a few seconds a solution of twelve grains of corrosive sublimate
along with three ounces of a strong emulsion of flour, and immediately
filtering,—I find that ammonia and carbonate of potass have
little or no effect, that hydriodate of potass occasions a yellow precipitate,
and that the acrid, astringent taste of the solution is removed;
whence it may be inferred, that the corrosive sublimate is all decomposed,
that little mercury remains in solution, and that what
does remain is in the form of a chloride of mercury and gluten.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>When neither albumen nor gluten is at hand, milk is a convenient
antidote of the same kind.</p>

<p class='c006'>Iron filings would appear to be also a good antidote. MM.
Milne-Edwards and Dumas have found that when they were administered
in the dose of an ounce to animals after twelve or eighteen
grains of corrosive sublimate had remained long enough in the
stomach for the symptoms to begin, the animals recovered from the
effects of the poison, and died only some days afterwards of the
effects of tying the gullet, which operation was necessary to prevent
them vomiting. The iron obviously acts by reducing the corrosive
sublimate to the metallic state.<a id='r1039' /><a href='#f1039' class='c013'><sup>[1039]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Meconic acid, the peculiar acid of opium, which will be described
under the head of that poison, is also probably a good antidote.
Pettenkoffer correctly remarks that this acid has a great tendency to
form very insoluble salts with the metallic oxides, particularly with
the deutoxides, and above all when the acid is previously in union
with a base which constitutes a soluble salt.<a id='r1040' /><a href='#f1040' class='c013'><sup>[1040]</sup></a> On this account it must
be a good antidote. Pettenkoffer adds, that the precipitating action
of the meconates is the reason why “the operation of corrosive sublimate
on the animal body is almost entirely prevented by opium.”
Opium, however, cannot be safely used in such quantity as to decompose
all the corrosive sublimate in a case of poisoning; for I find
that an infusion of thirty-three grains is required to precipitate all
which can be thrown down from a solution of five grains of the mercurial
salt. I am not aware of any instances on record where poisoning
with corrosive sublimate has been prevented or cured by opium
given so as to decompose the salt; but a very remarkable case will
be related under the head of Compound Poisoning, where the phenomena
of its action were masked and altered in a singular manner.
There is little doubt that the alkaline meconates must prove valuable
antidotes for corrosive sublimate. At present an effectual barrier to
their employment is their rarity; but they might be rendered more
accessible, as a great quantity of meconate of lime, which is at
present put to no use, is formed in the manufacture of muriate of
morphia; and meconate of potass may easily be prepared in sufficient
quantity from the meconate of lime.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been alleged by Dr. Buckler of Baltimore, that a mixture of
gold-dust and iron filings is an effectual antidote; but Orfila denies
this statement; and the fact if true would be unimportant, on account
of the improbability of the materials being ever at hand in practice.<a id='r1041' /><a href='#f1041' class='c013'><sup>[1041]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>M. Mialhe suggested not long ago as an antidote the proto-sulphuret
of iron prepared by decomposing sulphate of protoxide of iron
by hydrosulphate of ammonia; and Orfila found that it is a perfect
chemical antidote, which altogether prevents the poisonous action of
corrosive sublimate, if administered to animals either before or immediately
after the poison; but he further ascertained that the lapse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>of ten minutes was sufficient to render it of no use.<a id='r1042' /><a href='#f1042' class='c013'><sup>[1042]</sup></a> It is difficult,
however, to perceive why in this respect it should differ from white
of egg or any other chemical antidote.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the old antidotes for poisoning with corrosive sublimate,
such as the alkaline carbonates, the alkaline hydrosulphates, cinchona,
mercury, charcoal,—Orfila has given them all a fair trial, and found
them all inefficacious. It would appear, however, from a case related
in a late American journal, that frequent doses of charcoal powder
have much effect in soothing the bowels and allaying the inflammation
after the poison is evacuated.<a id='r1043' /><a href='#f1043' class='c013'><sup>[1043]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The treatment of mercurial salivation consists in exposure to a cool
pure air, nourishing diet, and purgatives, if the intestinal canal is not
already irritated. In some of the inflammatory affections it induces,
venesection is required; in others it is hurtful. In some complaints
induced by mercury, as in iritis, the poison appears to be its own antidote;
for nothing checks the inflammation so soon and so certainly as
mercurial salivation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Finlay of the United States proposed to check mercurial salivation
by small doses of tartar emetic frequently repeated, so as to
act on the skin;<a id='r1044' /><a href='#f1044' class='c013'><sup>[1044]</sup></a> and Mr. Daniell has recommended large doses of
the acetate of lead as an effectual antidote for the same purpose.<a id='r1045' /><a href='#f1045' class='c013'><sup>[1045]</sup></a> I
have tried both of these plans several times with apparent success.
In one instance particularly, where a severe salivation was threatened
by the administration of six grains of calomel in three doses, and
where profuse salivation, ulceration of the tongue and swelling of
the face actually did commence with violence, the mercurial affection
after a few days rapidly receded under the use of large doses of acetate
of lead.—Dr. Klose, a German physician, says he has found
iodine to possess the property of arresting the effects of mercury on
the mouth.<a id='r1046' /><a href='#f1046' class='c013'><sup>[1046]</sup></a> The iodide of potassium is generally acknowledged to
be one of the best remedies for eradicating the constitutional infirmities
left in many by severe courses of mercury.</p>

<p class='c006'>A great deal might be said on the treatment of the secondary effects
of poisoning with mercury. But a thorough investigation of the
subject would lead to such details as would be inconsistent with the
other objects of this work.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING WITH COPPER</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>Poisoning with the salts of copper was not long ago a common accident,
in consequence of the metal being much used in the fabrication
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>of vessels for culinary and other domestic purposes, or ignorantly
resorted to by confectioners and others to impart a good colour to
sweetmeats and preserves. Such accidents have been materially
diminished in frequency since the poisonous qualities of the metal,
and the circumstances under which it is acted on by articles of food,
have become known. Nevertheless they are still frequent enough.
The diffusion among the common people of the knowledge of the
properties of copper has also naturally led some persons to have recourse
to its preparations for the purpose of self-destruction. Poisoning
with copper has seldom been caused by the wilful act of another
person; for the deep colour of its compounds and their strong disagreeable
taste render it a difficult matter to administer them secretly.
This, however, though difficult, is not impossible: whatever may be
swallowed accidentally, may be also administered secretly. In 1795
a woman Inglis was tried at Aberdeen for administering sulphate of
copper with intent to poison; but the charge was not proved.<a id='r1047' /><a href='#f1047' class='c013'><sup>[1047]</sup></a> In
1842 an attempt was made at Béziers in France to poison a young
woman by dissolving this salt in her coffee; but the first mouthful
caused such a sense of constriction in the throat as to apprize her of
something deleterious being present, and she escaped after suffering
from soreness of the mouth, vomiting and cramps.<a id='r1048' /><a href='#f1048' class='c013'><sup>[1048]</sup></a> A case of imputed
poisoning with sulphate of copper has been related at page <a href='#Page_76'>76</a>.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section I.</span>—<i>Of the Chemical History and Tests of the Preparations of Copper.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Metallic copper has a special red colour, to which it gives its own
name. Its specific gravity is nearly 9, its hardness considerable, its
tenacity great, its point of fusion about 27° W. or at a full white
heat.</p>

<p class='c006'>It unites with oxygen in two proportions, forming a yellowish-red
protoxide, and a peroxide, which, when dry, is brownish-black—when
hydrated, azure-blue. It unites also with sulphur in two corresponding
proportions, forming a gold-yellow proto-sulphuret, the natural copper-pyrites,
and a black bisulphuret, which is formed by sulphuretted-hydrogen
in all the solutions of this metal. The peroxide unites with
ammonia. The acids all unite with the oxide and form blue or green
salts, some of which are soluble, some insoluble. The oxide is frequently
mixed with other matters to form various pigments; but in
such compounds the union is generally mechanical, not chemical.
Of the substances thus formed and existing in nature and the arts the
following only require notice here. 1. <i>Mineral green</i>, and other pigments
formed with the hydrated oxide. 2. <i>Natural verdigris</i>, or the
carbonate. 3. <i>Blue vitriol</i>, or the sulphate. 4. <i>Artificial verdigris</i>,
or the mixed acetates.</p>

<h5 class='c011'>1. <i>Mineral Green.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>The description of this substance and its chemical properties must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>be introduced with a short account of the tests for the unmixed <i>peroxide</i>.
When free of water the peroxide is a brownish-black powder
or granular mass, which is usually procured by decomposing
nitrate of copper at a low red heat. It is easily known by the solvent
power of nitric acid, the blue colour of the filtered solution, and the
beautiful deep violet tint communicated to the solution by an excess
of ammonia. The last property is considered by chemists the most
satisfactory proof of the presence of oxide of copper in a fluid. It is
alone quite free of fallacy, and may be applied to all the soluble and
also many insoluble compounds of copper, provided they are not
mixed with a large proportion of vegetable or animal fluids, in which
case the colour is often greenish.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the case of the peroxide and of copper poisons generally, the
process of reduction, which has been applied with such delicacy and
precision to arsenical and mercurial poisons, loses all its advantages.
The metal remains in the flux, and intimately diffused; so that of its
physical qualities the colour only can be estimated, and even that but
inaccurately, except in the instance of one compound, verdigris.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>hydrated peroxide of copper</i>, when newly formed and well prepared,
has a fine azure-blue colour; but on exposure to a gentle heat,
it parts with its water, and becomes the anhydrous peroxide. It is
procured by precipitating any of the soluble salts of copper by means
of caustic potass. It is at once known by the action of ammonia,
which immediately forms with it a deep violet-blue solution.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Mineral green</i>, as already mentioned under the head of Arsenic
(p. <a href='#Page_223'>223</a>), was originally an arsenical pigment introduced into the art
of colour-making by Scheele, and now sometimes sold in this country
by the name of emerald-green. But the mineral green of the
colourist now contains no arsenic, being a hydrate of peroxide of copper
intimately mixed with a little lime, which is generally carbonated.
This variety of mineral-green probably varies a little in composition.
Some parcels I have found to contain the lime in the state
of carbonate; in others the lime was chiefly caustic.</p>

<p class='c006'>The best method of determining its nature is to dissolve it in diluted
hydrochloric acid, which leaves only a slight cloudiness from
accidental impurities; and then to transmit through the filtered solution
a stream of sulphuretted hydrogen gas. The copper on boiling
is all thrown down in the form of a black bisulphuret, and hydrochlorate
of lime remains in solution. The lime is then to be detected
by its proper tests, after the solution has been filtered and neutralized
(see p. <a href='#Page_192'>192</a>). In general this long process is unnecessary, as
the medical jurist may be simply required to say whether the suspected
substance contains copper. In that case it is only requisite to
subject the substance to the action of ammonia, as if it was hydrated
peroxide.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Verditer</i>, another green pigment, the basis of which is always oxide
of copper, does not appear to differ essentially in composition
from mineral green. The samples I have examined consist of a large
proportion of hydrated oxide of copper, and a small proportion of
carbonate of lime.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>
  <h5 class='c011'>2. <i>Natural Verdigris.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c012'>This is a compound of no great importance in a medico-legal point
of view. Nevertheless an instance has been lately published in
which it was taken for the purpose of committing suicide, and was
found abundantly in the stomach.<a id='r1049' /><a href='#f1049' class='c013'><sup>[1049]</sup></a> The carbonate of copper exists
naturally in two states. In one form it constitutes the rust of copper,
or natural verdigris, and is produced as a powdery crust on metallic
copper by long exposure to moist air. It is insipid and insoluble, so
that pure water left in vessels incrusted with it does not become poisonous.
It dissolves with effervescence in sulphuric acid, and without
effervescence in ammonia, forming the usual violet solution. In
another form it exists in the mineral kingdom, constituting the chief
part of a beautiful ore, malachite, and also a considerable proportion
of some blue-copper ores.</p>

<h5 class='c011'>3. <i>Blue Vitriol.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>Blue vitriol, blue copperas, blue stone, vitriol of copper, as it is
variously called in common speech, is the sulphate of copper. In
the solid form it constitutes large crystals of a deep blue colour, and
an acrid, astringent, metallic taste, efflorescent in dry air, and very
soluble in water. Under the action of heat it first loses its water of
crystallization without undergoing the watery effusion; then its
sulphuric acid is driven off partly unchanged, partly decomposed;
and at last the brown peroxide is left behind in a state of considerable
purity. If carbonaceous matter be previously mixed with the
sulphate, the oxide is decomposed at a low red heat, so that the
process of reduction may be performed in a glass tube. For the
reasons formerly stated, this process does not constitute a convenient
or characteristic test for sulphate of copper. The best mode of
ascertaining its nature is to dissolve it, and then to apply the tests
for the solution.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are many excellent tests for copper in solution. But the
four following are the most delicate and characteristic,—ammonia,
sulphuretted hydrogen, ferro-cyanate of potass, and metallic iron.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <i>Ammonia</i> causes a pale azure precipitate, which is redissolved
by an excess of the test, forming a deep violet-blue transparent fluid.
If the solution is very diluted, there is no previous precipitation; the
fluid becomes violet without its transparency being disturbed. This
is a perfectly characteristic test of copper, and one of great delicacy.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. <i>Sulphuretted hydrogen gas</i> causes a dark brownish-black precipitate,
the sulphuret of copper. This test is one of very great delicacy;
but it is not alone decisive of the presence of copper, since
lead, bismuth, mercury, and silver, are similarly affected by it. A
method, however, will be presently described, by which the precise
nature of the sulphuret may be determined.</p>

<p class='c006'>The alkaline hydrosulphates, for example the hydrosulphate of
ammonia, answer equally well with sulphuretted-hydrogen. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>solution of the common liver of sulphur throws down, not a black,
but a chestnut precipitate.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. <i>Ferro-cyanate of potass</i> causes a fine hair-brown precipitate, the
ferro-cyanide of copper. This test is also exceedingly delicate and
characteristic.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. A polished rod or plate of <i>metallic iron</i>, held in a solution of
sulphate of copper, soon becomes covered with a red powdery crust,
which is metallic copper; and ere long the solution is changed in
colour from blue to greenish-yellow. The action is simple; the iron
merely displaces the copper in the solution, in which a sulphate of
iron is consequently formed. This test is characteristic, and even of
considerable delicacy. At the same time other substances may
cause a reddish encrustation on iron by simply rusting it, so that the
test cannot be relied on alone.</p>

<p class='c006'>The four preceding reagents taken together are amply sufficient to
prove the existence of copper in a solution. Three other tests, however,
may be here briefly alluded to.</p>

<p class='c006'>Caustic potass in a solution not too diluted causes a fine azure-blue
precipitate, the hydrated peroxide of copper.</p>

<p class='c006'>Oxide of arsenic, with the previous addition of a few drops of
ammonia, causes a fine apple-green or grass-green precipitate, the
arsenite of copper. This test, which is both delicate and characteristic,
has been already fully considered under the head of Arsenic.</p>

<p class='c006'>The process by fluid reagents, as hitherto laid down, merely
proves the presence of copper, but does not indicate the acid with
which the oxide is combined. In order to determine whether it is
sulphuric acid, the fluid must also be tested with nitrate of baryta
followed by nitric acid: a heavy white precipitate is thus produced,
which the excess of nitric acid does not redissolve.</p>

<h5 class='c011'>4. <i>Artificial Verdigris.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'><i>Artificial verdigris</i> is a common pigment, which is met with in the
form either of earth-like masses, or of a light powder of a greenish-blue
colour and peculiar disagreeable smell, approaching that of
vinegar. Like blue vitriol it has a strong metallic, astringent taste.
The effect of heat is peculiar. Some acetic acid is in the first place
distilled over; a portion of the acid, however, is decomposed and
reduces the oxide; and a low red heat is sufficient to make the
outer crust of the verdigris distinctly copper-red, when the material
is contained in a glass tube.</p>

<p class='c006'>Artificial verdigris varies somewhat in composition. Foreign verdigris
contains chiefly the hydrated diacetate, with a little carbonate,
oxide, and even metallic copper, along with particles of the fruit and
fruit-stalks of the grape. British verdigris consists of little else than
the hydrated diacetate. It is known by the following characters.
Ammonia dissolves it almost entirely, forming a deep violet solution.
Diluted sulphuric acid dissolves it, evolving an odour of acetic
acid, and forming a solution of sulphate of copper, which may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>known by the tests for that salt. Boiling water converts it partly
into an insoluble brown powder, which is oxide of copper in union
with a small proportion of acetic acid, and partly into a greenish-blue
neutral acetate, which is dissolved, and may be known by the
four tests for sulphate of copper, and the want of action of nitrate of
baryta.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be right to notice shortly three other salts of copper, the
nitrate, the ammoniacal sulphate, and the muriate. The <i>nitrate</i>
forms a violet solution, which is acted on by reagents in the same
way as the dissolved acetate, but has not any odour of vinegar.
The <i>ammoniacal sulphate</i> [ammoniated copper—ammoniuret of copper],
has been occasionally used in medicine. It forms, when solid,
small scaly crystals, of an intense violet colour and strong ammoniacal
odour; and when dissolved it retains its peculiar colour even
though very much diluted.—The <i>muriate</i> of copper has a lively
grass-green colour, and is acted on by reagents in the same way as
the solution of verdigris.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of the corrosion of copper by articles of food and drink.</i>—To these
observations on the chemical history of copper a few remarks must
be added relative to the action of various articles of food or drink
upon the metal. Unpleasant accidents have often happened from
the use of copper vessels in the preparation of food; and it is therefore
necessary for the medical jurist to know the circumstances, so
far as they have been investigated, under which the poison may be
dissolved.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Falconer found, that distilled water kept several weeks on a
polished plate of copper, neither injured its lustre, nor acquired any
taste, nor become coloured with ammonia;<a id='r1050' /><a href='#f1050' class='c013'><sup>[1050]</sup></a> and Drouard afterwards
observed, that distilled water, kept for a month on copper filings,
did not contain any of the metal.<a id='r1051' /><a href='#f1051' class='c013'><sup>[1051]</sup></a> Eller of Berlin, however, remarked,
that water, if it contain a considerable quantity of common
salt, as four ounces in five pounds, or a twentieth part, will give
slight traces of copper after being boiled in a brass pan; and that if
the pan be made of copper, a powder is procured by evaporation,
which when treated with acetic acid yields so much as 20 grains of
acetate of copper.<a id='r1052' /><a href='#f1052' class='c013'><sup>[1052]</sup></a> But it is a singular circumstance, also observed
by the same experimentalist, that if beef of fish be boiled with the
usual allowance of salt, and with the addition also of various vegetable
substances, the liquid does not yield any copper. This observation
has been lately denied by Professor Orfila; who says he found
copper deposited on a plate of iron in salt water in which beef had
been boiled, and that he also obtained copper from the beef itself.<a id='r1053' /><a href='#f1053' class='c013'><sup>[1053]</sup></a>
The quantity thus dissolved, however, must be exceedingly small, if
the copper be kept clean and free of oxide; for copper vessels,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>although they have often been the source of fatal accidents, if carelessly
used in the preparation of food, have appeared under careful
management to be quite harmless. An excellent practical confirmation
of this will be found in Michaelis’s Commentaries. He states,
that in the Orphan Hospital of Hallé, the food was in his time prepared
in large copper vessels, which were kept remarkably clean;
and that out of a population of eight or nine hundred he never heard
of any one having suffered from symptoms of poisoning with copper.<a id='r1054' /><a href='#f1054' class='c013'><sup>[1054]</sup></a>
Several other saline matters promote the solution of copper in water.
Thus Dr. Falconer found that alum has this effect when aided by
heat; and probably nitre and Epsom salt possess the same quality.<a id='r1055' /><a href='#f1055' class='c013'><sup>[1055]</sup></a>
Their mode of action is not very well known.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is a common though erroneous idea, that milk, heated or allowed
to stand in a copper vessel, becomes impregnated with the metal.
Eller has shown, that, on the contrary, if the vessel be well cleaned,
milk, tea, coffee, beer, and rain-water, kept in a state of ebullition
for two hours, do not contract the slightest impurity from copper;<a id='r1056' /><a href='#f1056' class='c013'><sup>[1056]</sup></a>
and the same remark has been also made by Dr. Falconer with respect
to cabbage, potatoes, turnips, carrots, onions, rice, and barley.<a id='r1057' /><a href='#f1057' class='c013'><sup>[1057]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>But Eller farther remarked, that, if the vessel is not thoroughly
clean, then all acid substances dissolve the carbonate that encrusts
it, especially if left in it for some time. Nay, it appears that some
acid matters, though they do not dissolve clean copper by being
merely boiled in it a few minutes, nevertheless, if allowed to cool
and stand some time in it, will acquire a sensible impregnation.<a id='r1058' /><a href='#f1058' class='c013'><sup>[1058]</sup></a>
Dr. Falconer also observed that syrup of lemons, boiled fifteen
minutes in copper or brass pans, did not acquire a sensible impregnation;
but if it was allowed to cool and remain in the pans for
twenty-four hours, the impregnation was perceptible even to the
taste, and was discovered by the test of metallic iron.<a id='r1059' /><a href='#f1059' class='c013'><sup>[1059]</sup></a> This fact
has been farther confirmed by the researches of Proust,<a id='r1060' /><a href='#f1060' class='c013'><sup>[1060]</sup></a> who states,
that, in preparing food or preserves in copper, it is not till the fluid
ceases to cover the metal, and is reduced in temperature, that solution
of the metal begins. Inattention to this difference has been
the cause of fatal accidents, of which the following case from Wildberg’s
Practical Manual will serve as a good example. A servant
left some sour-krout for only a couple of hours in a copper pan which
had lost the tinning. Her mistress and a daughter, who took the
cabbage to dinner, died after twelve hours illness; and Wildberg
found the cabbage so strongly impregnated with copper, that it was
detected by the test of metallic iron.<a id='r1061' /><a href='#f1061' class='c013'><sup>[1061]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Some wines have the same power, by reason of the acid they
contain. Hence Eller found twenty-one grains of the acetate in five
pounds of French white wine, after being boiled in a copper vessel.
An epidemic disease, mentioned by Fabricius, which broke out in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>1592 among the senators of Bern, and a number of their guests who
had been invited to a great entertainment, was supposed to have
arisen from a poisonous impregnation of this kind. The wine used
at the feast had been kept cool in copper vessels immersed in a very
cold well. Many of the company were attacked with dysenteric
symptoms, and some died.<a id='r1062' /><a href='#f1062' class='c013'><sup>[1062]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Vinegar also dissolves metallic copper. Dupuytren observed that
the vinegar sold by hawkers in the streets of Paris generally contained
copper from the action of the acetic acid on the stop-cocks of the
little vessels used in retailing it.<a id='r1063' /><a href='#f1063' class='c013'><sup>[1063]</sup></a> Others in like manner have found
copper in vinegar pickles prepared in copper vessels. Thus Dr.
Percival found a strong impregnation of copper in pickled samphire,
of which a young lady ate one morning two breakfast platefuls, and
which proved fatal to her in nine days.<a id='r1064' /><a href='#f1064' class='c013'><sup>[1064]</sup></a> And Dr. Falconer once
detected so large a quantity in some pickled cucumbers bought at a
great London grocer’s, that it was deposited on a plate of iron, and
imparted its peculiar taste and smell to the pickles.<a id='r1065' /><a href='#f1065' class='c013'><sup>[1065]</sup></a> It seems indeed
to have been at one time the custom to make a point of adulterating
pickles with copper; for in many old cookery-books the
cook is told to make her pickles in a copper pan, or to put some
halfpence among the pickles to give them a fine green colour.<a id='r1066' /><a href='#f1066' class='c013'><sup>[1066]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The action of the vegetable acids, and more particularly of vinegar
on copper, depends on the co-operation of the atmospheric air held
in solution by the fluid, and in contact with its surface. Without
such co-operation the copper cannot be oxidated. This fact, which
was determined experimentally by Proust,<a id='r1067' /><a href='#f1067' class='c013'><sup>[1067]</sup></a> will explain the observations
of Eller and Falconer,—that it is not dangerous to boil acidulous
liquids in copper vessels, while it is very unsafe to keep these
fluids cold in the same vessels. In the latter instance the liquid is
impregnated with atmospheric air, while in the former the usual
aëriform contents are driven off by the heat. I must observe, however,
in limitation of Proust’s statement, that strong vinegar, such as
the pyroligneous acetic acid, will become impregnated to a certain
extent if boiled in copper vessels. The action which takes place is
the same as that remarked by him in the case of cold vinegar:<a href='#f1067' class='c013'><sup>[1067]</sup></a> the
copper where it is always covered remains quite bright; but at the
edge of the fluid it becomes oxidated, and the oxide is dissolved by
the occasional bubbling up of the acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the last place, the property of oxidating and uniting with copper
is likewise possessed by fatty matters and oils. According to
Falconer, fatty substances do not act on metallic copper unless they
are rancid.<a id='r1068' /><a href='#f1068' class='c013'><sup>[1068]</sup></a> But Proust is probably more correct when he states,
that they will act, though fresh, provided they are aided by the co-operation
of atmospheric air.<a id='r1069' /><a href='#f1069' class='c013'><sup>[1069]</sup></a> I have found, that, if a plate of copper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>be thrust into a mass of fresh butter, its surface becomes dark in
twenty-four hours, and the butter becomes green wherever it is in
contact both with the copper and the air, but not where it covers
the metal closely. In fresh hog’s lard, however, I have found that
the whole lard in contact with the copper becomes blue even at a
depth to which the air can scarcely reach. The action of oils is
similar. It is even probable that they act when hot; for Mr. Travis
found that hot oil became green when kept for only four or five
minutes in a copper vessel.<a id='r1070' /><a href='#f1070' class='c013'><sup>[1070]</sup></a> Dr. Falconer mentions that the property
of acting on copper is possessed in an eminent degree by volatile
oils, and especially by oil of cloves and oil of cinnamon.<a id='r1071' /><a href='#f1071' class='c013'><sup>[1071]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The general result of the preceding observations is, that there is
hardly any article of food or drink which may not become impregnated
with copper if kept in copper vessels, as there are few articles
which do not contain either an acid or some fatty matter; and it
farther appears, that the impregnation will scarcely ever take place
during the boiling of such articles, but only during the preservation
of them in a cold state. It must also be considered, that, independently
of these chemical impregnations, articles of food may be
mixed mechanically with copper, in consequence of the vessels being
allowed, through the carelessness of the cook, to become covered
with rust or carbonate, which is subsequently removed by the friction
of the solid parts of any article that is boiled in them.</p>

<p class='c006'>In order to prevent accidental impregnations, copper vessels are
usually tinned. The tinning consists of an alloy of tin and lead,
which is much less easily attacked than the copper, and the safety of
which is farther insured by the circumstance, that the substances
endowed with the property of dissolving lead, cannot attack that
metal before the whole tin of the alloy is oxidated.<a id='r1072' /><a href='#f1072' class='c013'><sup>[1072]</sup></a> The tinning
of copper, however, has been found to be but a partial protection, as
the tinning is apt to be worn away without attracting the attention of
servants. Hence the use of copper in the fabrication of kitchen
utensils is becoming every day more and more limited, especially
since the manufacture of cast-iron vessels was brought to perfection
in this country.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many instances might be adduced of the ignorance and carelessness
which prevailed, even not far back in the last century, as to the
employment of copper vessels for culinary purposes. In addition to
the instances already quoted, the following are well deserving of
notice. Gmelin was consulted by the abbot of a monastery, on account
of a violent disease which prevailed throughout the whole
brotherhood of monks. The symptoms were obstinate and severe
colic, retching and bilious vomiting, costiveness, flatus, burning pain
in the pit of the stomach, under the sternum, in the kidneys and extremities,
and paralytic weakness in the arms. On inquiring into
the cause of this singular combination of symptoms, Gmelin found
that every vessel in the kitchen, the pots and pans, and even the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>milk pails and butter dishes for storing the butter, were made of
copper.<a id='r1073' /><a href='#f1073' class='c013'><sup>[1073]</sup></a> In 1781 an establishment of Jacobin monks at Paris were
all violently affected from a similar error. The cook on a Friday
and the subsequent Saturday, after boiling fish for the dinner of the
monks in a copper pan, and drawing off the water, poured vinegar
over the fish, and left it thus in the pan for a considerable time. On
the evening of Friday several of them were taken severely ill with
headache, acute pain in the stomach and bowels, precordial anxiety,
purging, great feebleness, and cramps in the legs. The rest of them,
to the number of twenty-one in all, were similarly attacked next
morning; and the symptoms continued in most of them for five or
six days.<a id='r1074' /><a href='#f1074' class='c013'><sup>[1074]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>A singular variety of adulteration with copper was brought not
long ago into public notice on the continent,—namely, the impregnation
of bread with the sulphate of copper, which was used in
small quantity for promoting the fermentation of the dough. This
practice was first detected in some of the towns of Flanders, but was
afterwards found to prevail in France.<a id='r1075' /><a href='#f1075' class='c013'><sup>[1075]</sup></a> Some chemists of reputation
have indeed doubted altogether the existence of the practice;
and M. Barruel in particular, who was consulted on the subject by
the Prefecture of Paris, publicly declared his disbelief, because he
remarked that, instead of favouring the panary fermentation, a very
small proportion of sulphate of copper actually impeded it, and besides
gave the bread a greenish colour of such depth that no customer would
take it for a wholesome article.<a id='r1076' /><a href='#f1076' class='c013'><sup>[1076]</sup></a> Subsequent inquiries, however, have
shown that Barruel must have allowed himself to be misled, probably
by using too much of the sulphate of copper. For the bakers of St.
Omer admitted that they practised this ulceration for the sake of saving
their yeast, the proportion required being an ounce of the salt
in two pints of water, for every hundred weight (<i>quintal</i>) of dough,
or about an 1800th part.<a id='r1077' /><a href='#f1077' class='c013'><sup>[1077]</sup></a> And it appears from an interesting set of
experiments by M. Meylink, a chemist of Deventer, that, contrary
to the statements of Barruel, sulphate of copper not only possesses
the property of promoting the panary fermentation, but likewise constitutes
in several important respects a source of adulteration, which
ought to be prohibited and strictly looked after. He found that when
he added to half a Flemish pound of dough from one grain to eight
grains of sulphate of copper, fermentation took place more quickly
than in the same dough without such addition, and nearly in proportion
to the quantity of the salt used;—that the adulterated loaves
when taken out of the oven were much better raised, and the loaf
with only one grain of the salt likewise much whiter, than those
which were not adulterated;—that a slight increase, however, in
the proportion rendered the loaf greenish, and gave it a peculiar
taste; but especially that the employment of the salt of copper even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>in the small proportion of one grain had the singular effect of bringing
about the complete fermentation of the dough with considerably
less loss of weight than occurs in the common process of baking,
the loss in the sound and in the adulterated loaves being in the proportion
of 116 to 100.<a id='r1078' /><a href='#f1078' class='c013'><sup>[1078]</sup></a> It certainly seems fully proved, then, that
the adulteration of bread with sulphate of copper is an important
fraud in more ways than one. Some doubt may be entertained whether
any injury can result to the human body from even the habitual
use of so small a quantity as that employed by the bakers; and at all
events, we may be satisfied that if any bad effects do result, this can
only happen from the continual use of the adulterated bread for a
great length of time. But there can be no doubt that the practice is
a fraud on the public, by enabling the baker to make his loaves of
the standard weight with a less allowance of nutritive material.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another important adulteration also indicated by foreign chemists,
is that of syrup made with the coarsest kinds of sugar, and decolorized
by means of sulphate of copper. The colour is removed by
adding a solution of the sulphate to the syrup boiling hot, and decomposing
the salt by lime; but a portion of the salt is often left behind,
and in consequence accidents have arisen from such syrups
being used in making various medicinal preparations.<a id='r1079' /><a href='#f1079' class='c013'><sup>[1079]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of the detection of copper in organic mixtures.</i>—As in the instance
of arsenic and mercury, so in that of copper the presence of
vegetable and animal principles interposes material obstacles in the
application of the ordinary tests and methods of analysis. Some substances,
such as albumen, milk, tea, coffee, and the like, decompose
the solutions of the salts of copper, throwing down the oxide of
copper in union with various proximate principles. Others, such as
red wine, bile, vomited matter, and the tissues composing the stomach,
although they do not decompose the soluble copper salts,
alter materially the action of reagents on them. These facts were
established long ago by Professor Orfila;<a id='r1080' /><a href='#f1080' class='c013'><sup>[1080]</sup></a> and various processes
were suggested by him, by myself in former editions of this work,
and by various other authors, with the view of overcoming the difficulties
in question.</p>

<p class='c006'>More lately a fresh difficulty has been started, which has been
thought to render every prior process fallacious, including that which
I have proposed. For it is alleged that copper exists naturally as a
constituent part of many vegetable and animal substances, and more
especially in the organs of the human body. This statement is so
important as to deserve attentive consideration before fixing on a
method of analysis for medico-legal cases.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some time ago Meissner pointed out the existence of a trace of
copper in some vegetable substances;<a id='r1081' /><a href='#f1081' class='c013'><sup>[1081]</sup></a> and more recently M. Sarzeau
alleged that a minute quantity of this metal, sometimes not above a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>1,500,000th and never exceeding a 120,000th part, may be detected
not only in all vegetable substances, but likewise in the blood, as well
as other fluids and solids of the animal body. Among vegetable substances
he examined with great care cinchona-bark, madder, coffee,
wheat and flour; and he succeeded in separating metallic copper
from them all.<a id='r1082' /><a href='#f1082' class='c013'><sup>[1082]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The accuracy of these researches was called in question. By some
chemists the discoveries of Meissner and Sarzeau were confirmed so
far as they relate to vegetable substances. By others the confirmation
was extended to the animal body, and more especially to the
human organs and secretions. Thus M. Devergie says, that, having
been struck with the singular circumstance of two cases occurring to
him in a single year, where analysis indicated copper in the tissues
of the alimentary canal of persons suspected of having died of poison,
he was led to inquire, along with M. O. Henry, whether the
metal was contained naturally in the textures of the human body; and
that in the course of many experiments, although unable to detect
any in a solution made by means of weak acetic acid, he could
always find it by the process of incineration.<a id='r1083' /><a href='#f1083' class='c013'><sup>[1083]</sup></a> Orfila has also repeatedly
detected traces of copper in the bodies of animals not poisoned
with the preparations of that metal.<a id='r1084' /><a href='#f1084' class='c013'><sup>[1084]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>By other experimentalists opposite results have been obtained, more
especially in regard to animal solids and fluids. In the course of an
inquiry relative to the question, whether poisons pass into the blood,
I failed to detect copper in the blood, muscles, or spinal marrow of
animals, although the method of analysis must have enabled me to
discover extremely minute quantities of that metal. Afterwards M.
Chevreul was unable to detect the slightest trace of copper in beef,
veal, or mutton; nor was he more successful in the case of wheat,
provided care was taken to keep the sample clean.<a id='r1085' /><a href='#f1085' class='c013'><sup>[1085]</sup></a> And more recently
MM. Flandin and Danger have denied that there is any
copper ever found naturally in the body.<a id='r1086' /><a href='#f1086' class='c013'><sup>[1086]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>These discrepant results appear to be in a great measure reconciled
in an extensive inquiry into the subject by M. Boutigny; who
found that wheat, wine, cider, and some other substances of a vegetable
nature, do frequently present minute traces of copper, but only
when copper is contained in the manure used in raising the grain,
apples, and the like; that manure from the streets of great towns
always contains copper, and introduces it into vegetable articles
grown where such manure is used; and that the occasional presence
of the same metal in animal substances may be traced either to
copper vessels having been employed in preparing or preserving
them, or to the animals producing them having been fed on vegetables
presenting from the causes mentioned above a faint cupreous impregnation.<a id='r1087' /><a href='#f1087' class='c013'><sup>[1087]</sup></a>—Another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>fallacy, which may account for the alleged
invariable success of some chemists, has been pointed out by M.
Hiers-Reynaert of Bruges. Having once obtained copper in a specimen
of suspected bread, when he used paper for a filter, but none
when he used linen, he was led to examine various filtering papers,
and found that some kinds contain an appreciable trace of copper.<a id='r1088' /><a href='#f1088' class='c013'><sup>[1088]</sup></a>
This important fact must be attended to in all medico-legal investigations.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the whole, whatever may be thought of the physiological question,
whether copper forms a constituent of the textures and fluids of
vegetables and animals, it seems well established that this metal is
often present there in minute proportion; and consequently its possible
presence must not be overlooked in medico-legal researches.
Fortunately methods of analysis are known which this source of fallacy
does not affect.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Process.</i> The following method embraces all possible cases; and
it is exempt, so far as yet appears, from every source of error.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Should the subject of analysis not be a liquid, render it such
by dividing it into small fragments, and boiling it gently for an hour
in distilled water acidulated with acetic acid, which must previously
be ascertained not to contain any copper. If the liquid be not viscid,
filter it at once; but if it be too viscid for filtration, pass it through a
muslin sieve, add two volumes of rectified spirit to it when cool, and
then filter it. Transmit through a small portion of it a stream of hydrosulphuric
acid gas; and if a brownish-black precipitate or cloud
form, subject the whole liquid to the gas. A brown precipitate,
which is sulphuret of copper, will separate either immediately, or
after ebullition and repose for an hour. Collect the precipitate, if
abundant, by filtration, if scanty, by repeated subsidence and affusion.
Dry it, subject it to a low red heat, and then heat it with a
little strong nitric acid, which will convert the sulphuret into the sulphate
of copper. This salt, dissolved out by boiling distilled water,
may be subjected to the tests described above, and especially to ammonia.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. If the copper be extremely minute in quantity, sulphuretted
hydrogen will not act upon it in a fluid much charged with organic
matter. To meet this possible case, which may occur when the
subject of analysis is an organ of the human body into which the
poison has been conveyed by absorption,—let the liquid be evaporated
to dryness, and charred in the following manner. Heat in a
porcelain basin a quantity of nitric acid equal in weight to the residuum,
together with a fifteenth of chlorate of potash. Add the dry
residuum in successive portions of such magnitude as not to occasion
too great effervescence. When it has been all added, heat the product
till it become dark-red and thick. It will then, or soon afterwards,
begin suddenly to char, and at length a thick vapour will
arise in dense clouds; upon which, the charring being complete, the
heat must be withdrawn. Pulverise the carbonaceous mass; boil it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>with nitric acid diluted with its own volume of water; and evaporate
the filtered fluid to dryness, so as to expel any excess of acid. Dissolve
the saline residuum, and test the solution with the usual reagents.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first branch of this process is nearly the same with the one
adopted in the last edition of the present work. The second is derived
from a process lately proposed by Orfila.<a id='r1089' /><a href='#f1089' class='c013'><sup>[1089]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The principles on which it is founded are these. 1. Of the numerous
organic compounds formed by vegetable and animal principles
with the salts of copper, all either dissolve in very weak acetic acid,
or part with their oxide of copper to it. This was pointed out by
me in my last edition. 2, Weak acetic acid, as already mentioned
(p. <a href='#Page_356'>356</a>), has been shown by M. Devergie to be incapable of dissolving
that copper which is contained naturally in the tissues, at
least so as to render it discoverable by the subsequent steps of the
process. 3, According to Orfila, copper naturally present in organic
substances, is never indicated by the second branch of the process,
provided the charred product of the action of nitric acid and chlorate
of potash be not heated to incineration. It does not appear why the
charring process, when so conducted, should separate adventitious
copper, and not that which is present naturally. But the empirical
fact may be accepted in the mean time, as it rests on apparently careful
experiments.</p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila does not use acetic acid in the first branch of his process, but
merely infuses the suspected matter in cold water, and if copper be
not thus found, he has recourse to boiling water. But this method
introduces needless complexity; and besides neither maceration, nor
boiling with mere water, will dissolve out the whole oxide of copper.
Acidulation with acetic acid dissolves it all; and Devergie has shown
that this advantage is gained without any additional fallacy arising
from the possible presence of copper as a natural ingredient of the
substance under examination (p. <a href='#Page_356'>356</a>).</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section II.</span>—<i>Of the Action of Copper, and the Symptoms it excites in Man.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The symptoms caused by copper have at least two varieties in their
character. One class arises from its local action on the alimentary
canal; the other from its operation on distant organs.</p>

<p class='c006'>This double influence is proved by the experiments of Drouard on
animals, published in his inaugural dissertation at Paris in 1802; and
by those of Orfila in his Toxicology.</p>

<p class='c006'>When Drouard gave twelve grains of verdigris to a strong dog
fasting, he observed that it caused aversion to food, efforts to vomit,
diarrhœa, listlessness, and death in twenty-two hours; and that the
stomach was but little inflamed. When two grains dissolved in water
were injected into the jugular vein of another dog, it caused vomiting
and discharge of fæces in seven minutes, then rattling in the throat,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>and death in half an hour; and there was no particular morbid appearance
in the body.—Half a grain killed another in four days;
and in addition to the preceding symptoms, there was palsy of the
hind legs for a day before death. Six grains of the sulphate introduced
into the stomach killed a dog in half an hour, without producing
any appearance of inflammation.<a id='r1090' /><a href='#f1090' class='c013'><sup>[1090]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>These experiments prove that it is not by causing local irritation
that this poison proves fatal. But its mode of action is more distinctly
shown in the later and more accurate experiments of Orfila. He
found that twelve or fifteen grains of the neutral acetate generally
killed dogs within an hour; and that besides the usual symptoms of
irritation in the stomach, they often had insensibility, almost always
convulsions, and immediately before death rigidity, or even absolute
tetanus. He likewise remarked violent convulsions and insensibility
when a grain of this salt was injected into the veins; and death was
then seldom delayed beyond ten minutes. In no case was there any
particular morbid appearance, except loss of contractility in the voluntary
muscles.<a id='r1091' /><a href='#f1091' class='c013'><sup>[1091]</sup></a> More recently results nearly the same have been
obtained by Mitscherlich; and when doses of two drachms of sulphate
of copper were given, he observed after death pale blueness of
the villous coat of the stomach, mingled with brownness,—the apparent
effect of chemical action.<a id='r1092' /><a href='#f1092' class='c013'><sup>[1092]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Allied to these results are those obtained by my late colleague,
Dr. Duncan, and by Mitscherlich, when the sulphate was applied to a
wound. Dr. Duncan observed that death took place in twenty-two
hours, and the body was every where in a healthy state. Mitscherlich
found that a drachm of either sulphate or acetate proved
fatal in four hours, with symptoms of extreme prostration. The experiments
of M. Smith, repeated by Orfila, are at variance with
these; for one or two drachms of the acetate applied to a wound in
the thigh of a dog caused only local inflammation, and no constitutional
symptoms.<a id='r1093' /><a href='#f1093' class='c013'><sup>[1093]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It follows from the researches now detailed, that the salts of copper
act in whatever way they are introduced into the system, and the
more energetically, the more directly they enter the blood. The inquiries
of Mr. Blake farther show, that when injected into the blood-vessels,
they act with peculiar force in exhausting muscular irritability,
and occasion death by paralysing the heart if they are injected
into a vein. Six grains of the sulphate injected into the jugular vein
of a dog reduced the force of the heart’s contractions, and fifteen
grains arrested them in twelve seconds, leaving in the dead body
distension of the heart, loss of contractility, and florid blood in the
left cavities. Ten grains injected into the aorta through the axillary
artery caused no sign of obstruction in the capillary system; and
small doses of three or four grains occasioned vomiting, dyspnœa, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>stiffness of the limbs; and immediately after death the muscles had
lost their irritability.<a id='r1094' /><a href='#f1094' class='c013'><sup>[1094]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Copper has been sought for, with variable success, in the blood of
animals poisoned with its salts. Drouard was unable to detect it in
the blood. But this need not excite surprise, because the same physiologist
could not detect it, even when he had injected it into a
vein.—Lebküchner, who published a thesis at Tübingen in 1819,
on the permeability of the living membranes, succeeded in discovering
it. He introduced four grains of the ammoniacal sulphate into the
bronchial tubes of a cat, and five minutes afterwards, when the animal
was under the action of the poison, he drew some blood from the
carotid artery and jugular vein; and he detected copper in the serum
of the former, but not in the latter, by sulphuretted-hydrogen and
hydrosulphate of ammonia.<a id='r1095' /><a href='#f1095' class='c013'><sup>[1095]</sup></a>—Afterwards Dr. Wibmer of Munich
also succeeded in discovering it. In a dog which had taken from
four to twenty grains of the neutral acetate daily for several weeks,
he found the metal in the substance of the liver, but not anywhere
else. In the charcoally matter left by incinerating the liver, nitric
acid formed a solution, which when neutralized gave the characteristic
action of the salts of copper with sulphuretted-hydrogen, ferro-cyanate
of potash, and ammonia.<a id='r1096' /><a href='#f1096' class='c013'><sup>[1096]</sup></a> Fischer also found copper in the
blood of a dog which in forty-three days had got gradually-increasing
doses of acetate of copper, till at length twelve grains were taken
daily.<a id='r1097' /><a href='#f1097' class='c013'><sup>[1097]</sup></a> Orfila has recently often detected copper in the liver, spleen,
heart, kidneys, and lungs of animals poisoned with its salts.<a id='r1098' /><a href='#f1098' class='c013'><sup>[1098]</sup></a> These
facts are not all invalidated by the late discovery of the presence of copper
in the animal tissues of men and animals not poisoned with its
preparations. For in the experiments of Wibmer and of Orfila the
quantity found in cases of poisoning was much larger than in the ordinary
state of things; and the poison was accumulated in particular
organs, especially the liver. The absorption of copper may therefore
be considered as fully substantiated; and it is equally important
whether it be regarded as a physiological or medico-legal fact.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Duncan’s experiment on its effect when applied to a wound
shows that it may prove fatal when applied externally. Yet in
small quantities, the sulphate is daily used with safety for dressing
ulcers.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the preparations of copper which are poisonous, it is pretty
certain that, like all other metals, it is not deleterious unless oxidated,
and that its soluble salts are by far the most energetic. Portal, indeed,
has related the case of a woman who, while taking from a half
a grain to four grains of copper filings daily, was seized with symptoms
of poisoning.<a id='r1099' /><a href='#f1099' class='c013'><sup>[1099]</sup></a> But it is probable the filings were oxidated;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>for Drouard gave an ounce to dogs without injuring them at all,<a id='r1100' /><a href='#f1100' class='c013'><sup>[1100]</sup></a> and
Lefortier more lately observed that two drachms had no effect.<a id='r1101' /><a href='#f1101' class='c013'><sup>[1101]</sup></a> The
same explanation must be given of the injury sustained by those artisans
who prepare and use what is called “bronze dust” in printing
and paper-staining. If the substance employed be nothing else than
an alloy of copper and zinc, as is alleged, the injurious effects to be
mentioned presently can only be explained on the supposition that
the copper becomes oxidated either before or after coming in contact
with the body. It deserves to be added, that many persons
have swallowed copper coins and retained them for weeks without
having any symptoms of poisoning.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sulphuret is equally innocuous with the metal if pure; but it
appears probable that it becomes oxidated by long exposure to the
air, and passes into the state of sulphate. Orfila found that an ounce
of recently prepared sulphuret had no effect on a dog; but half an
ounce of a parcel which had been long kept caused vomiting, and
yielded a little sulphate to water.<a id='r1102' /><a href='#f1102' class='c013'><sup>[1102]</sup></a> The power of the oxides has
not been ascertained. They are certainly poisonous; and Lefortier
found that both the red dioxide and black protoxide undergo solution
in no long time in the stomachs of dogs.<a id='r1103' /><a href='#f1103' class='c013'><sup>[1103]</sup></a> The hydrated protoxide
is probably more active. From some experiments made at
the hospital of St. Louis in Paris, it appears that twelve grains will
cause nausea, pain in the stomach and bowels, vomiting and diarrhœa.<a id='r1104' /><a href='#f1104' class='c013'><sup>[1104]</sup></a>
There is no doubt that the carbonate or natural verdigris,
the phosphate, and even the subphosphate, though quite insoluble in
water, are capable of acting as poisons, because Lefortier found that
they are soon dissolved in the stomachs of dogs, and in small doses
cause severe vomiting in the course of fifteen minutes.<a id='r1105' /><a href='#f1105' class='c013'><sup>[1105]</sup></a> But it is
chiefly in the soluble salts that we are to look for the full development
of the action of this poison. A very small quantity of the sulphate
will prove fatal; for, as already noticed, Drouard found that
six grains killed a dog in half an hour.</p>

<p class='c006'>The symptoms caused by the soluble salts of copper in man are,
in a general point of view, the same with those caused by arsenic
and corrosive sublimate. But there are likewise some peculiarities.
According to the cases related by Orfila in his Toxicology, the first
symptom is violent headache, then vomiting and cutting pains in the
bowels, and afterwards cramps in the legs and pains in the thighs.
Sometimes throughout the whole course of the symptoms there is a
peculiar coppery taste in the mouth, and a singular aversion to the
smell of copper. Drouard notices this in his thesis; and says, that,
having himself been once poisoned with verdigris, the smell of copper
used to excite nausea for a long time after.<a id='r1106' /><a href='#f1106' class='c013'><sup>[1106]</sup></a> Another symptom,
which occasionally occurs in this kind of poisoning, and never, so
far as I know, in poisoning with arsenic or corrosive sublimate, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>jaundice. It likewise appears that, when the case ends fatally, convulsions
and insensibility generally precede death.</p>

<p class='c006'>A set of cases illustrating the slighter forms of poisoning with
copper has been published by M. Bonjean of Chambéry. The cause
was the preparation of an acid confection in a copper vessel. Two
women suffered from severe headache, constriction of the throat,
nausea, colic, and extreme weakness. Two young men, who had
eaten the confection more freely, had for some hours excruciating
colic, severe pain in the mouth and throat, impeded breathing, and
hurried irregular pulse; and for twenty-four hours they suffered
severely from headache and prostration of strength.<a id='r1107' /><a href='#f1107' class='c013'><sup>[1107]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The following case communicated to Professor Orfila by one of his
friends will convey a good idea of the symptoms in severe cases,
which do not prove fatal. A jeweller’s workman swallowed intentionally
half an ounce of verdigris, suspended in water. In fifteen
minutes he was attacked with colic pains and profuse vomiting and
purging. When seen by the physician eight hours afterwards there
was not much vomiting, but frequent eructation of a matter containing
verdigris, some salivation, a small pulse, and blueness about the
eyes. In sixteen hours jaundice began to appear. In the course of
the night he was a good deal relieved from the colic pains by three
alvine discharges; and next morning he had ceased to vomit, and
the pain had disappeared. But he complained of a taste of copper
in his mouth, and the jaundice had increased. From this time he
recovered rapidly, and on the fourth day convalescence was confirmed.<a id='r1108' /><a href='#f1108' class='c013'><sup>[1108]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>When the poisoning ends fatally, convulsions, palsy, and insensibility,
the signs in short of some injury done to the brain, are very
generally present. This is illustrated by a good example in Pyl’s
Essays and Observations. It was the case of a confectioner’s daughter,
who took two ounces of verdigris, and died on the third day
under incessant vomiting and diarrhœa, attended towards the close
with convulsions, and then with palsy of the limbs. This case,
however, is chiefly valuable for the dissection, which will be noticed
presently.<a id='r1109' /><a href='#f1109' class='c013'><sup>[1109]</sup></a> But two cases of the same description are related in
greater detail by Wildberg in his Practical Manual, which clearly
show the action of this poison on the brain. They are the cases
formerly alluded to of a lady and her daughter who were poisoned
by sour-krout kept in a copper pan. Soon after dinner they were
attacked first with pain in the stomach, then with nausea and anxiety,
and next with eructation and vomiting of a green, bitter, sour,
astringent matter. The pain afterwards shot downwards throughout
the belly, and was then followed by diarrhœa; afterwards by convulsions,
at first transient, then continued; and finally by insensibility.
The daughter died in twelve hours, the mother an hour
later.<a id='r1110' /><a href='#f1110' class='c013'><sup>[1110]</sup></a> In these three cases, although there was not any jaundice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>noticed during life, the skin was very yellow after death.—In some
instances it would appear that narcotic symptoms form the commencement
and irritant symptoms the termination of the poisoning.
This unusual relation occurs in a case of recovery related by M.
Julia-Fontenelle, and also, though less remarkably, in a fatal case
mentioned by Wibmer. The subject of the former was a man who
intentionally took a solution of copper in vinegar, prepared by keeping
several sous-pieces seven days in that fluid. In three hours he
was found in a state of insensibility, with the jaws locked, the muscles
rigid and frequently convulsed, the breathing interrupted, and
the pulse small and slow. In half an hour he was so far roused that he
could tell what he had done; and soon after taking white of eggs the
convulsions ceased: but next day the belly was hard and tender,
and the repeated application of leeches was required to subdue the
abdominal irritation that ensued.<a id='r1111' /><a href='#f1111' class='c013'><sup>[1111]</sup></a> In the fatal case by Wibmer,
that of a girl of 18, who was poisoned by a dish of beans having
been cooked in a copper vessel, sickness, pain of the belly and
vomiting speedily arose, but were soon followed by convulsions and
loss of consciousness. Next day there was little pain, but extraordinary
paralytic weakness of the arms and legs: the abdomen afterwards
became distended and painful; and death took place in
seventy-eight hours.<a id='r1112' /><a href='#f1112' class='c013'><sup>[1112]</sup></a>—A case where convulsions were produced
by two drachms of blue vitriol is mentioned by Dr. Percival.<a id='r1113' /><a href='#f1113' class='c013'><sup>[1113]</sup></a>—In
other instances it would appear that no nervous affection occurs at
all, as in the case of a young lady related by Percival, who, when
poisoned with pickled samphire containing copper, suffered chiefly
from pains in the stomach, an eruption over the breast, general
shooting pains, thirst, a frequent small pulse, vomiting, hiccup, and
purging. Death occurred on the ninth day, without stupor or convulsions.<a id='r1114' /><a href='#f1114' class='c013'><sup>[1114]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Besides these effects when introduced in considerable doses and
in the form of soluble salts, copper is said to produce other disorders
when applied to the body for a long time in minute quantities and
in its metallic or oxidized state. Among those artisans who work
much with copper various affections are thought to be gradually
engendered by merely handling the metal. Patissier in his treatise
on the diseases of artisans says, that copper-workers have a peculiar
appearance which distinguishes them from other tradesmen,—that
they have a greenish complexion,—that the same colour
tinges their eyes, tongue, and hair, their excretions, and even their
clothes through the medium of the perspiration,—that they are
spare, short in stature, bent, their offspring ricketty, and they themselves
old and even decrepit at their fortieth or fiftieth year.<a id='r1115' /><a href='#f1115' class='c013'><sup>[1115]</sup></a> Mérat
also asserts that they are liable to the painters’ colic, that peculiar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>disease soon to be noticed as a common effect of the long-continued
application of lead.<a id='r1116' /><a href='#f1116' class='c013'><sup>[1116]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>But these notions must be received with some limitation. At least
the alleged effects on copper-workers are by no means invariable. For
copper-workers now-a days in this country and elsewhere are by no
means the unhealthy persons Patissier represents them to be. As to
colica pictonum, it is very rare among them; and possibly the cases
noticed by Mérat might have been produced by the secret introduction
of lead into the body, if indeed they were not cases of common
colic.</p>

<p class='c006'>A very singular set of cases was lately brought under notice by
Mr. Gurney Turner, where poisoning seemed to have been occasioned
by the external application or inhalation of the fine dust used for
imitating gilding by painters, paper-stainers, and porcelain-painters,
and which is said to be essentially brass in a state of fine division.
The workmen who use it, are very apt to be attacked with irritation
about the private parts, and a vesicular eruption about the hairs on
the pubes,—with loss of appetite, tendency to vomiting, and other
symptoms of irritation in the stomach,—with obstinate constipation,—with
soreness and dryness of the throat and irritation in the nose,—and
with want of sleep, and a remarkable greenness of the hair
over the whole body.<a id='r1117' /><a href='#f1117' class='c013'><sup>[1117]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section III.</span>—<i>Of the Morbid Appearances caused by Copper.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The appearances found in the body after death by poisoning with
copper are chiefly the signs of inflammation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Where death takes place very rapidly, however, it is probable, that
no diseased appearance whatever will be perceptible. At least this
was the case in the animals experimented on by Drouard and Orfila;
and little doubt can therefore be entertained that the result would be
the same with man also in similar circumstances.</p>

<p class='c006'>When death ensues more slowly, as in the only fatal cases yet
on record of its action on man, the marks of inflammation coincide
with the signs of irritation during life. The best account I have seen
of the morbid appearances under such circumstances is in the cases
related by Pyl, by Wildberg, by Wibmer, and by Dégrange.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Pyl’s case the whole skin was yellow. The intestines, particularly
the lesser intestines, were of an unusual green colour, inflamed,
and here and there gangrenous. The stomach was also green; its
inner coat was excessively inflamed; and near the pylorus there was
a spot as big as a crown, where the villous coat was thick, hard,
and covered with firmly adhering verdigris. The lungs are likewise
said to have been inflamed. The blood was firmly coagulated.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the cases related by Wildberg, which are very like each other,
the skin on various parts, and particularly on the face, was yellow,
but on the depending parts livid. The outer coat of the stomach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>and intestines was here and there inflamed; and the inner coat of the
former was very much inflamed, and even gangrenous<a id='r1118' /><a href='#f1118' class='c013'><sup>[1118]</sup></a> near the
pylorus and cardia. The duodenum and jejunum, and likewise the
gullet, were in a similar state. The blood in the heart and great
vessels was black and fluid.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the case of the girl referred to by Wibmer, the skin was ochre-yellow,
the stomach green, much inflamed, especially near the pylorus,
the gullet and intestines also inflamed, the diaphragm red, the brain
healthy, the lungs and heart “gorged with thick blood.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In the case of poisoning with carbonate of copper described by
Dégrange [p. <a href='#Page_348'>348</a>], in which, however, it is probable that death was
accelerated by a fall, there was found congestion of the surface of the
brain, arborescent redness of the gullet and a green sand over its surface,
general greenness of the villous coat of the stomach, with vascularity
of the fundus and points of superficial ulceration, greenness
of the whole intestines, with black vascular ecchymosed spots and
softening, except in the ileum, and redness of the inner surface of
the heart. Copper was detected in the contents of the stomach and
intestines.</p>

<p class='c006'>The intestines have been found perforated by ulceration, and their
contents thrown out into the sac of the peritonæum. Portal has related
one case where the small intestines were perforated, and several
where the perforation was in the rectum, which portion of the intestines,
as well as the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, was also extensively
ulcerated.<a id='r1119' /><a href='#f1119' class='c013'><sup>[1119]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The existence of verdigris in the form of powder lining the inside
of the stomach after incessant vomiting for three days, is of course
an important circumstance in the inspection of the body. But too
much reliance ought not to be placed on mere bluish or greenish
colouring of the membranes. For Orfila<a id='r1120' /><a href='#f1120' class='c013'><sup>[1120]</sup></a> and Guersent<a id='r1121' /><a href='#f1121' class='c013'><sup>[1121]</sup></a> have both
observed, that the inside of the stomach as well as its contents may
acquire these tints in a remarkable degree in consequence of natural
disease.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section IV.</span>—<i>Of the Treatment of Poisoning with Copper.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The treatment of poisoning with the salts of copper has been examined
in relation to the antidotes by M. Drouard, M. Marcelin-Duval,
Professor Orfila, and M. Postel.</p>

<p class='c006'>The alkaline sulphurets were at one time thought to be antidotes
for the poisons of copper, but without any reason. Drouard found
that fifteen grains of verdigris killed a dog in thirty hours, notwithstanding
the free use of the liver of sulphur.<a id='r1122' /><a href='#f1122' class='c013'><sup>[1122]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Afterwards M. Marcelin-Duval was led from his experiments to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>infer that sugar was an antidote,<a id='r1123' /><a href='#f1123' class='c013'><sup>[1123]</sup></a> and in the first editions of his
Toxicology Professor Orfila agreed with him, and related some experiments
of his own, which, along with those of Duval, seemed to
place the fact beyond all doubt. Later and more careful experiments,
however, satisfied Orfila, that it only acts as an emollient after
the poison has been removed from the stomach, and that it has no
effect at all if the poison is retained by a ligature in the gullet.<a id='r1124' /><a href='#f1124' class='c013'><sup>[1124]</sup></a>
Sugar being thus rejected as well as the sulphurets, he was led to try the
effects of albumen; and his experiments induced him to recommend
that substance as an antidote in preference to every thing else. He
found that the white of six eggs completely neutralized the activity
of between 25 and 36 grains of verdigris; so that even when the
mixture was retained in the stomach by a ligature on the gullet no
effect ensued which could be ascribed to the poison. He infers that
white of egg is the best antidote for poisoning with copper.<a id='r1125' /><a href='#f1125' class='c013'><sup>[1125]</sup></a> He
likewise found the ferro-cyanate of potass not inferior.<a id='r1126' /><a href='#f1126' class='c013'><sup>[1126]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Since the publication of these inquires the subject has been again
examined by M. Postel, who reverts to the original proposition of
Duval, that sugar is really a good antidote; and he rests this conclusion
partly on direct comparative experiments, showing that it is at
least equally effective with white of egg, and partly on the singular
fact ascertained by him, that sugar, which was believed to decompose
the salts of copper only at the temperature of 212°, does actually
accomplish this decomposition at the temperature of the human
body, and throws down the copper in the form of oxide.<a id='r1127' /><a href='#f1127' class='c013'><sup>[1127]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>According to the experiments of MM. Milne-Edwards and Dumas,
metallic iron is likewise a good antidote: they found that when
fifteen, twenty, and even fifty grains of sulphate of copper, acetate of
copper, or verdigris, were given to animals, and an ounce of iron
filings administered either immediately before, or immediately afterwards,—the
gullet being tied to prevent the discharge of the poison,—death
did not ensue for five, six, or even eight days, and
consequently proceeded from the operation on the gullet; and that
in one experiment, on the ligature being removed from the gullet,
the opening healed up, and complete recovery took place.<a id='r1128' /><a href='#f1128' class='c013'><sup>[1128]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Before quitting the subject of the treatment, it is necessary to
caution the practitioner particularly against the employment of vinegar,—a
substance often ignorantly used for this, in common with
many other, species of poisoning. On account of its solvent power
over the insoluble compounds formed by the salts of copper with
animal and vegetable matters, it must be injurious rather than
useful.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING WITH ANTIMONY.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The fourth genus of the metallic irritants includes the preparations
of antimony. Poisoning with antimonial preparations is not common.
They are employed extensively in medicine, however, and consequently
accidents have sometimes occurred with them. One of
them is also often foolishly used, in the way of amusement, to cause
sickness and purging, and likewise to detect servants who are suspected
of making free with their mistress’s tea-box or whisky-bottle;
and in both of these ways alarming effects have sometimes been produced.
In 1837 a woman was tried in England for attempting to
poison a child with tartar-emetic; but the poison appeared to have
been given through ignorance.<a id='r1129' /><a href='#f1129' class='c013'><sup>[1129]</sup></a> In large doses some of the antimonial
compounds may cause death; and one of them, the chloride
of antimony, now very little used in this country, is a violent corrosive.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section I.</span>—<i>Of the Chemical History and Tests for the preparations of Antimony.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Metallic antimony has a bluish-white colour, not liable to tarnish.
Its specific gravity is 6·7. It is easily fused, but is not very volatile.
In certain circumstances, however, it easily undergoes a spurious sublimation,
by being carried along with gases disengaged while it is in
the act of being reduced.</p>

<p class='c006'>A great number of preparations of antimony were at one time to be
found in the shop of the apothecary; but they are now reduced to a
few. Those which require notice here are the oxide, chloride, and
tartar-emetic.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>oxide</i> [sesquioxide] is a white heavy powder, which is best
known by its solubility in tartaric acid, and the effects of the tests for
tartar-emetic on the solution.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>chloride</i> [sesquichloride], as usually seen, is a yellow or reddish
liquid, but when pure is colourless. It is highly corrosive. It
is readily known by the effect of water in decomposing it,—an insoluble
white subchloride being thrown down, and hydrochloric acid
remaining in solution. The latter is detected by nitrate of silver;
and the precipitate is known by being soluble in a solution of tartaric
acid, and then presenting the reactions of tartar-emetic.</p>

<h5 class='c011'><i>Tartar-Emetic.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>In its solid state tartar-emetic forms regular tetraedral or
more generally octaedral crystals, which are colourless when pure,
efflorescent, and of a slightly metallic taste. As commonly seen
in the shops it is in the form of a white, or pale yellowish-white
powder.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>When heated it decrepitates and then chars; and if the heat be
increased the oxide of antimony is reduced by the carbonaceous
matter, and little globules appear, like those of quicksilver in point
of colour. The best way of reducing tartar-emetic is to char it in a
porcelain vessel or watch-glass, and then to increase the heat till the
charred mass takes fire. Or the charred mass may be introduced
into a tube and heated strongly with the blowpipe, after which globules
of antimony will be found lining the bottom of the glass where
the material has been. None of it is ever sublimed. It is not easy
to procure distinct globules by heating tartar-emetic at once in a small
tube.</p>

<p class='c006'>According to Dr. Duncan, tartar-emetic is soluble in three parts
of boiling and fifteen of temperate water. The solution presents the
following characters with reagents.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <i>Caustic potass</i> precipitates a white sesquioxide, but only if
the solution is tolerably concentrated. The first portions of the
test have no effect. The precipitate is redissolved by an excess of
potass.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. <i>Nitric acid</i> throws down a white precipitate, and takes it up
again when added in excess.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The <i>Infusion of Galls</i> causes a dirty, yellowish-white precipitate;
but it will not act on a solution which contains much less than
two grains per ounce.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. The best liquid reagent is <i>Hydrosulphuric acid</i>. In a solution
containing only an eighth part of a grain per ounce, it strikes an
orange-red colour, which, when the excess of gas is expelled by heat,
becomes an orange-red precipitate; and if the proportion of salt is
greater, the precipitate is thrown down at once.—The colour of the
precipitate is so peculiar as to distinguish it from every other sulphuret;
but if any doubt regarding its nature should occur, it may be known
by collecting it, dissolving it with the aid of gentle heat in hydrochloric
acid, and adding water to the solution; which will then yield
a white precipitate, the sesquioxide of antimony in union with a little
chlorine.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. When the solution is put into Marsh’s apparatus for detecting
arsenic [p. <a href='#Page_211'>211</a>], the flame yields a dark brownish-black, obscurely
shining crust on a surface of porcelain held across it, and a white
crystalline powder if the porcelain be held just above the flame. The
dark crust is antimony, the white one its oxide. The former has
only a distant resemblance to the brilliant stain of arsenic, notwithstanding
all that has been said of their similarity. It is well, however,
to use some other test for distinguishing the two metals besides their
appearance; and the most convenient is a solution of chloride of lime,
which instantly makes an arsenical crust disappear, but does not affect
an antimonial one.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tartar-emetic, like the soluble salts of mercury and copper,
is decomposed by various organic principles. All vegetable substances
that contain a considerable quantity of tannin have this
effect; of which an example has been already mentioned in the
action of infusion of galls. Decoctions of cinchona-bark decompose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>it still more effectually. The animal principles do not act
on tartar-emetic, with the exception of milk, which is slightly
coagulated by a concentrated solution. Many vegetable and
animal substances, though they do not decompose it, alter the
operation of the fluid tests. Thus tea, though it does not effect
any distinct decomposition of the salt, will prevent the action of
gall-infusion; and French wine gives a violet tint to the precipitates
with that test and with acids.<a id='r1130' /><a href='#f1130' class='c013'><sup>[1130]</sup></a> Hydrosulphuric acid,
however, acts under all circumstances, and always characteristically,
whatever the colour of the fluid may be. Dr. Turner
found that when transmitted through a diluted solution in tea,
porter, broth, and milk, with certain precautions to be mentioned
presently, he procured a precipitate which either showed its proper
colour at once, or did so at the margin of the filter on which
it was collected.<a id='r1131' /><a href='#f1131' class='c013'><sup>[1131]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The circumstances now referred to render it necessary to resort to
other means, besides the simple application of liquid reagents, for the
purpose of detecting tartar-emetic in complex organic mixtures. This
subject has been ably investigated, first by Dr. Turner,<a id='r1132' /><a href='#f1132' class='c013'><sup>[1132]</sup></a> and afterwards
by Professor Orfila.<a id='r1133' /><a href='#f1133' class='c013'><sup>[1133]</sup></a> The result of the researches of both
seems to me to be that the most convenient method yet proposed is
the following.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Process for Tartar-emetic in Organic Mixtures.</i>—If the subject of
analysis be not already liquid enough, add distilled water. Then
acidulate with a little hydrochloric and tartaric acids; the former of
which throws down some animal principles, while the latter dissolves
readily all precipitates formed with tartar-emetic by reagents or organic
principles except the sulphuret. Filter the product.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Subject a small portion of the liquid to a stream of hydrosulphuric
acid gas, and if it be perceptibly coloured orange-red, treat the
whole liquid in the same way; boil to expel the excess of gas, collect
the precipitate, dry it, and reduce it by hydrogen gas in the following
manner. Put the sulphuret in a little horizontal tube, transmit hydrogen
through the tube by means of the apparatus represented in Figure
9, and when all the air of the apparatus is expelled, apply heat to the
sulphuret with a spirit-lamp. Hydrosulphuric acid gas is evolved,
and metallic antimony is left, if the current of hydrogen be gentle, or
it is sublimed if the current be rapid.—When there is much animal
or vegetable matter present in the sulphuret, the metal is not always
distinctly visible. In that case, dissolve the antimony by the action
of nitric acid on the mixed material and broken fragments of the tube,
and throw down the orange sulphuret again from the neutralized solution
by hydrosulphuric acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. If hydrosulphuric acid do not distinctly affect the liquid, or if
no precipitate be separated after boiling, or so small a quantity as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>cannot well be collected,—evaporate the liquid to dryness, char it by
means of nitric acid and chlorate of potash, as directed for copper
(p. <a href='#Page_357'>357</a>), boil the carbonaceous mass for half an hour in a mixture of
eight parts of hydrochloric acid and one of nitric acid, and introduce
the filtered solution into the modification of Marsh’s apparatus
for detecting arsenic described in page <a href='#Page_204'>204</a>, but without the tube <i>e h</i>.
Kindle the gas at <i>e</i>, and try whether a black, dull stain, not removable
by solution of chloride of lime, be produced on a surface of porcelain
held across the flame. If no stain be produced, there was no antimony
in the liquid under examination. If the porcelain be stained, apply the
heat of a spirit-lamp flame to the tube <i>d e</i>. Antimony will be deposited
within the tube where the heat is applied. In order to ascertain
its nature, break the tube, heat the portion containing the crust with
nitro-hydrochloric acid, evaporate to dryness, dissolve the residue in
hydrochloric acid, decompose a part of this solution with water, and
subject the rest to a stream of hydrosulphuric acid gas, which will
produce the usual orange sulphuret of antimony.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. If antimony be not indicated in either of these ways in the fluid
part of the subject of analysis, the solid portion may next be subjected
to the second process; but success will very seldom attend the search
when the previous steps have failed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first branch of this process,—a slight modification of Dr.
Turner’s,—is a very delicate and satisfactory method of detecting antimony
in organic mixtures. Some practice is required to transmit the
hydrogen gas with the proper rapidity. The gas ought to be allowed
to pass for some time before the spirit-lamp flame is applied, otherwise
the oxygen remaining in the apparatus may cause an explosion,
or will oxidate the metallic antimony, formed by the reduction of the
sulphuret. As soon as the reduction of the sulphuret begins, the
tube is blackened on account of the action of the sulphuretted-hydrogen
on the lead contained in the glass. This obscures the operations
within the tube; but on subsequently breaking it, a metallic button
or a sublimate will be easily seen. When the sulphuret is considerable
in quantity and the gaseous current slow, the metal remains where
the sulphuret was; but if the mass of sulphuret is small and the current
rapid, then the metal is sublimed and condensed in minute scaly
brilliant crystals.</p>

<p class='c006'>The second branch of the process is a modification of the method
lately employed by Professor Orfila for detecting antimony in the textures
and secretions of animals poisoned with tartar-emetic. It is
probably more delicate than the other, but not more satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c006'>The method of analysis here recommended, as well as every other
yet proposed for organic mixtures, merely detects the presence of antimony.
It does not indicate the state in which the metal was combined.
It is a process in short for antimony in every state of combination.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is almost unnecessary to observe that when the contents of the
stomach or vomited matters are the subject of analysis, care must be
taken to ascertain that tartar-emetic was not administered as a
remedy.</p>

  <h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> II.—<i>Of the Action of Tartar-Emetic, and the Symptoms it excites in Man.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>There is little peculiarity in what is hitherto known of the
symptoms of poisoning with tartar-emetic in man. Cases in
which it has been taken to the requisite extent are rarely met
with; and it has seldom remained long enough in the stomach
to act deleteriously. But its action on animals would appear
from the experiments of Magendie to be in some respects peculiar.</p>

<p class='c006'>He found that dogs, like man, may take a large dose with
impunity, for example half an ounce, if they are allowed to vomit;
but that if the gullet is tied, from four to eight grains will
kill them in a few hours. His subsequent experiments go to
prove that death is owing to the poison exciting inflammation in
the lungs. When six or eight grains dissolved in water were
injected into a vein, the animal was attacked with vomiting and
purging, and death ensued commonly within an hour. In the
dead body he found not only redness of the whole villous coat
of the stomach and intestines, but also that the lungs were of an
orange-red or violet colour throughout, destitute of crepitation,
gorged with blood, dense like the spleen, and here and there
even hepatized. A larger quantity caused death more rapidly
without affecting the alimentary canal; a smaller quantity caused
intense inflammation there and death in twenty-four hours; but
the lungs were always more or less affected.<a id='r1134' /><a href='#f1134' class='c013'><sup>[1134]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It is a fact, too, worthy of notice, that in whatever way this poison
enters the body its effects are nearly the same. This is shown not
only by the researches of Magendie already mentioned, but likewise
by the experiments of Schloepfer, who found that a scruple dissolved
in twelve parts of water and injected into the windpipe, caused violent
vomiting, difficult breathing, and death in three days; and in
the dead body the lungs and stomach were much inflamed, particularly
the former.<a id='r1135' /><a href='#f1135' class='c013'><sup>[1135]</sup></a> It farther appears from an experiment related by
Dr. Campbell, that, when applied to a wound, it acts with almost
equal energy as when injected into a vein. Five grains killed a
cat in this way in three hours, causing inflammation of the wound,
and vivid redness of the stomach.<a id='r1136' /><a href='#f1136' class='c013'><sup>[1136]</sup></a> He did not find the lungs
inflamed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Magendie infers from his own researches that tartar-emetic occasions
death when swallowed, not by inflaming the stomach, but through
means of a general inflammatory state of the whole system subsequent
to its absorption,—of which disorder the affection of the stomach
and intestines and even that of the lungs are merely parts or symptoms.
The later experiments of Rayer tend in some measure to confirm
these views, by showing that death may occur without inflammation
being excited any where. In animals killed in twenty-five
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>minutes by tartar-emetic applied to a wound, he, like Dr. Campbell,
could see no trace of inflammation in any organ of the great
cavities.<a id='r1137' /><a href='#f1137' class='c013'><sup>[1137]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila has proved by analysis the important fact that tartar-emetic
is absorbed in the course of its action, and may be detected in the
animal tissues and secretions. He found that, when it is applied to
the cellular tissue of small dogs, two grains disappear before death:
That antimony may be detected by his process given above throughout
the soft textures generally, but especially in the liver and
kidneys: but that it is quickly discharged from these quarters through
the medium of the urine. Hence in an animal that died in four hours
he found it abundantly in the liver and still more in the urine; in one
that survived seventeen hours, the liver presented mere traces of
the poison, but the urine contained it in abundance; and in one that
lived thirty-six hours, there was a large quantity in the urine, but
none at all in the liver. He also ascertained that antimony is generally
to be found in the urine of persons who are taking tartar-emetic
continuously in large doses for pneumonia according to Rasori’s mode
of administering it.<a id='r1138' /><a href='#f1138' class='c013'><sup>[1138]</sup></a> These results have been confirmed by the conjoined
researches of Panizza and Kramer, who found antimony in the
urine and blood of a man during a course of tartar-emetic.<a id='r1139' /><a href='#f1139' class='c013'><sup>[1139]</sup></a> And
Flandin and Danger also satisfied themselves that in animals it may
be generally detected in the liver.<a id='r1140' /><a href='#f1140' class='c013'><sup>[1140]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Effects on Man.</i>—When tartar-emetic is swallowed by man, it generally
causes vomiting very soon and is all discharged; and then
no other effect follows. But if it remains long in the stomach before
it excites vomiting, or if the dose be large, more permanent
symptoms are sometimes induced. The vomiting recurs frequently,
and is attended with burning pain in the pit of the stomach, and followed
by purging and colic pains. There is sometimes a sense of
tightness in the throat, which may be so great as to prevent swallowing.
The patient is likewise tormented with violent cramps.
Among the cases hitherto recorded no notice is taken of pulmonary
symptoms; which might be expected to occur if Magendie’s experiments
are free of fallacy.</p>

<p class='c006'>The late introduction of large doses of tartar-emetic into medical
practice having excited some doubt as to its poisonous properties, it
becomes a matter of some moment to possess positive facts on the
subject. The following cases may therefore be quoted, which will
satisfy every one that this substance is sometimes an active irritant.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first is particularly interesting from its close resemblance to
cholera. It occurred in consequence of an apothecary having sold
tartar-emetic by mistake for cream of tartar. The quantity taken
was about a scruple. A few moments afterwards the patient complained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>of pain in the stomach, then of a tendency to faint, and at
last he was seized with violent bilious vomiting. Soon after that he
felt colic pains extending throughout the whole bowels, and accompanied
ere long with profuse and unceasing diarrhœa. The pulse at
the same time was small and contracted, and his strength failed completely;
but the symptom which distressed him most was frequent
rending cramp in the legs. He remained in this state for about six
hours, and then recovered gradually under the use of cinchona and
opium; but for some time afterwards he was liable to weakness of
digestion.<a id='r1141' /><a href='#f1141' class='c013'><sup>[1141]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The next case to be mentioned, where the dose was forty grains,
proved fatal, although the person vomited soon after taking it. The
symptoms illustrate well the compound narcotico-acrid action often observed
in animals. The poison was taken voluntarily. Before the
person was seen by M. Récamier, who relates the case, he had been
nearly two days ill with vomiting, excessive purging, and convulsions.
On the third day he had great pain and tension in the region
of the stomach, and appeared like a man in a state of intoxication.
In the course of the day the whole belly became swelled, and at
night delirium supervened. Next day all the symptoms were aggravated;
towards evening the delirium became furious; convulsions
followed; and he died during the night, not quite five days after
taking the poison.<a id='r1142' /><a href='#f1142' class='c013'><sup>[1142]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Severe effects have also been caused by so small a dose as six
grains. A woman, who swallowed this quantity, wrapped in paper,
was seized in half an hour with violent vomiting, which soon became
bloody. In two hours the decoction of cinchona was administered
with much relief. But she had severe colic, diarrhœa, pain in
the stomach, and some fever; of which symptoms she was not completely
cured for five days.<a id='r1143' /><a href='#f1143' class='c013'><sup>[1143]</sup></a> A case has been published, where a
dose of only four grains caused pain in the belly, vomiting, and purging,
followed by convulsions, failure of the pulse, and loss of speech;
and recovery took place very slowly.<a id='r1144' /><a href='#f1144' class='c013'><sup>[1144]</sup></a> Under the head of the treatment
another case will be noticed where half a drachm excited severe
symptoms, and was probably prevented from proving fatal only
by the timely use of antidotes.</p>

<p class='c006'>While these examples prove that tartar-emetic is occasionally an
active irritant in the dose of a scruple or less, it must at the same
time be admitted to be uncertain in its action as a poison. This appears
from the late employment of it in large doses as a remedy for
inflammation of the lungs. The administration of tartar-emetic in
large doses was a common enough practice so early as the seventeenth
century, and was also occasionally resorted to by physicians
between that and the present time. But it is only in late years that,
by the recommendations of Professor Rasori of Milan,<a id='r1145' /><a href='#f1145' class='c013'><sup>[1145]</sup></a> and M.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>Laennec of Paris, it has again become a general method of treatment.
According to this method, tartar-emetic is given to the extent
of twelve, twenty, or even thirty grains a day in divided doses;
and not only without producing any dangerous irritation of the alimentary
canal, but even also not unfrequently without any physiological
effect whatever. Doubts were at one time entertained of the
accuracy of the statements to this effect published by foreign physicians;
but these doubts are now dissipated, as the same practice has
been tried, with the same results, by many in Britain. Rasori
ascribes the power the body possesses of enduring large doses of
tartar-emetic without injury, to a peculiar diathesis which accompanies
the disease and ceases along with it. And it is said, that the
same patients, who, while the disorder continues, may take large
doses with impunity, are affected in the usual manner, if the doses
are not rapidly lessened after the disease has begun to give way.
The testimony of Laennec on the subject is impartial and decisive.
He observes he has given as much as two grains and a half every
two hours till twenty grains were taken daily, and once gave forty
grains in twenty-four hours by mistake; that he never saw any harm
result; and that vomiting or diarrhœa was seldom produced, and
never after the first day. The power of endurance he found to diminish,
but not, as Rasori alleges, to cease altogether, when the fever
ceases; for some of his patients took six, twelve, or eighteen grains
daily when in full convalescence.<a id='r1146' /><a href='#f1146' class='c013'><sup>[1146]</sup></a> My own observations correspond
with Laennec’s, except as to the effects of large doses during
convalescence, of which effects I have had no experience. I have
seen from six to twenty grains, given daily in several doses of one
or two grains, check bad cases of pneumonia and bronchitis, without
causing vomiting or diarrhœa after the first day, and also without increasing
the perspiration. At the same time I have twice seen the
first two or three doses excite so violent a purging and pain in the
stomach and whole bowels, that I was deterred from persevering with
the remedy. In continued fever too I have repeatedly found that the
doses mentioned above did not cause any symptoms of irritation in
the stomach or intestines.</p>

<p class='c006'>The large quantities now mentioned have even been sometimes
given in a single dose with nearly the same results. Dr. Christie
mentions in his Treatise on Cholera that he sometimes gave a scruple
in one dose with the effect of exciting merely some vomiting and
several watery stools. But he admits that in one instance symptoms
were induced like those of a case of violent cholera.<a id='r1147' /><a href='#f1147' class='c013'><sup>[1147]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The same large doses have been given by some in delirium tremens
without any poisonous effect being produced. A correspondent
of the Lancet has even mentioned that on one occasion, after gradually
increasing the dose, he at last wound up the treatment, successfully
as regarded the disease, and without any injury to the patient,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>by giving four doses of twenty grains each, in the course of twenty
minutes.<a id='r1148' /><a href='#f1148' class='c013'><sup>[1148]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>These facts are sufficiently perplexing, when viewed along with
what were previously quoted in support of the poisonous effects of
tartar-emetic. On a full consideration of the whole circumstances,
however, I conceive the conclusion which will be drawn is, that this
substance is not so active a poison as was till lately supposed;—that
in the dose of four, six, or ten grains, it may cause severe symptoms,
but is uncertain in its action,—and that although there appears
to be some uncertainty in the effects of even much larger doses, such
as a scruple, yet in general violent irritation will then be induced,
and sometimes death itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>An instance is related in the Journal Universel of a man who,
while in a state of health, swallowed seventeen grains, and then tried
to suffocate himself with the fumes of burning charcoal. He recovered,
though not without suffering severely from the charcoal fumes;
but he could hardly be said to have been affected at all by the tartar-emetic.<a id='r1149' /><a href='#f1149' class='c013'><sup>[1149]</sup></a>
Here the inactivity of the poison was probably owing to
the narcotic effects of the fumes.</p>

<p class='c006'>The effects of tartar-emetic on the skin are worthy of notice;
but they have not yet been carefully studied. Some facts tend to
show that even its constitutional action may be developed through
the sound skin. Mr. Sherwen attempted to prove by experiments on
himself and two pupils, that five or seven grains in solution will,
when rubbed on the palms, produce in a few hours nausea and copious
perspiration.<a id='r1150' /><a href='#f1150' class='c013'><sup>[1150]</sup></a> His observations have been confirmed by Mr.
Hutchinson.<a id='r1151' /><a href='#f1151' class='c013'><sup>[1151]</sup></a> But Savary, a French physician, on repeating these
experiments, could remark nothing more than a faint flat taste and
slight salivation;<a id='r1152' /><a href='#f1152' class='c013'><sup>[1152]</sup></a> and Mr. Gaitskell could not remark any constitutional
effect at all.<a id='r1153' /><a href='#f1153' class='c013'><sup>[1153]</sup></a> Sometimes it has appeared to cause severe
symptoms of irritant poisoning when used in the form of ointment to
excite a pustular eruption. An instance of this has been described
in a late French Journal.<a id='r1154' /><a href='#f1154' class='c013'><sup>[1154]</sup></a> Nay, in the Medical Repository there is
a case, in which the external use of tartar-emetic ointment is supposed
to have been the cause of death. The subject was an infant,
two years old, who, soon after having the spine rubbed with this
ointment, was seized with great sickness and frequent fainting, which
in forty-eight hours proved fatal.<a id='r1155' /><a href='#f1155' class='c013'><sup>[1155]</sup></a> Considering the numerous opportunities
which medical men have had of witnessing the effects of
tartar-emetic applied in the same manner, and that these are solitary
cases, doubts may be entertained whether the irritant symptoms in
the one case, or the child’s death in the other, were occasioned in
the way supposed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although the constitutional action of tartar-emetic is not easily
developed through the sound skin, its local effects are severe and
unequivocal. When applied to the skin it does not corrode, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>excites inflammation, on which account it is much used instead of
cantharides. It does not blister; but after being a few days applied,
it brings out a number of painful pustules; if it be persevered in, the
skin ulcerates; and if it be applied to an ulcerated surface it causes
profuse suppuration, or sometimes even sloughing.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tartar-emetic is one of the substances which appear to possess the
property of acting on the infant through the medium of its nurse’s
milk. I do not know, indeed, what may be the general experience
on this point; but a French physician, M. Minaret, has published a
clear case of the kind, in the instance of a young woman who was
taking tartar-emetic for pleurisy, and whose infant was attacked
with a fit of vomiting immediately after every attempt to suck the
breast.<a id='r1156' /><a href='#f1156' class='c013'><sup>[1156]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>There is some reason to suppose, that the vapours of antimony
may prove injurious when inhaled. Four persons, constantly exposed
in preparing antimonial compounds to the vapour of antimonious
acid and chloride of antimony, were attacked with headache, difficult
breathing, stitches in the back and sides, difficult expectoration
of viscid mucus, want of sleep and appetite, mucous discharge from
the urethra, loss of sexual propensity, atrophy of the testicles, and a
pustular eruption on various parts, but especially on the scrotum.
They all recovered.<a id='r1157' /><a href='#f1157' class='c013'><sup>[1157]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> III.—<i>Of the Morbid Appearances produced by Tartar-emetic.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The morbid appearances caused by tartar-emetic have not been
often witnessed in man.</p>

<p class='c006'>In M. Récamier’s case there were some equivocal signs of reaction
in the brain. The organs in the chest were healthy. The villous
coat of the stomach, except near the gullet, where it was healthy,
was everywhere red, thickened, and covered with tough mucus.
The whole intestines were completely empty. The duodenum was
in the same state as the stomach; but the other intestines were in
their natural condition.</p>

<p class='c006'>M. Jules Cloquet observed in the body of a man who died of
apoplexy, and who in the course of five days had taken forty grains
of tartar-emetic, without vomiting or purging,—that the villous
coat of the stomach had a deep reddish-violet colour, with cherry-red
spots interspersed; and that the whole small intestines were of a
rose-red tint spotted with cherry-red.<a id='r1158' /><a href='#f1158' class='c013'><sup>[1158]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The only other dissection I have seen noticed is one by Hoffmann.
He says that in a woman poisoned by tartar-emetic he found the
stomach gangrenous, and the lungs, diaphragm, and spleen as it
were in a state of putrefaction.<a id='r1159' /><a href='#f1159' class='c013'><sup>[1159]</sup></a> Little credit can be given to this
description.</p>

  <h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> IV.—<i>Of the Treatment of Poisoning with Antimony.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The treatment of poisoning with tartar-emetic is simple. If the
poison be not already discharged, large draughts of warm water
should be given and the throat tickled, to bring on vomiting. At
the same time some vegetable decoction should be prepared, which
possesses the power of decomposing the poison; and none is better
or more likely to be at hand than a decoction of cinchona-bark, particularly
yellow-bark. The tincture is also a good form for giving
this antidote. The administration of bark has been found useful
even after vomiting had continued for some length of time, probably
because a part of the poison nevertheless remained undischarged.
Before the decoction is ready, it is useful to administer the bark in
powder. It is alleged, however, by M. Toulmouche that decoction
of cinchona is not nearly so serviceable as infusion of galls, and that
powder of galls is better still.<a id='r1161' /><a href='#f1161' class='c013'><sup>[1161]</sup></a> When there is reason to believe
that the patient has vomited enough, and that a sufficient quantity
of the antidote has been taken, opium is evidently indicated and has
been found useful; but venesection may be previously necessary if
the signs of inflammation in the stomach are obstinate.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following case related by M. Serres was probably cured by
cinchona. At all events, the effect of the antidote was striking. A
man purchased half a drachm in divided doses at different shops,
and swallowed the whole in a cup of coffee. Very soon afterwards
he was attacked with burning pain in the stomach, convulsive tremors,
and impaired sensibility,—afterwards with cold clamminess
of the skin, hiccup, and some swelling of the epigastrium, but not
with vomiting. Decoction of cinchona was given freely. From
the first moment almost of its administration he felt relief, and began
to sweat and purge. Next morning, however, he vomited, and for
some days there were evident signs of slight inflammation in the
stomach; nay, for a month afterwards he had occasional pricking
pains in that region; but he eventually recovered.<a id='r1162' /><a href='#f1162' class='c013'><sup>[1162]</sup></a> Another and
more pointed case has been related by Dr. Sauveton of Lyons. A
lady swallowed by mistake for whey a solution of sixty grains of
tartar emetic. In ten minutes she was seen by her physician, and at
this time vomiting had not commenced. Tincture of bark was immediately
given in large doses. No unpleasant symptom occurred
except nausea and slight colic.<a id='r1163' /><a href='#f1163' class='c013'><sup>[1163]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila considers that the diuretic plan of treatment recommended
by him for arsenic [p. <a href='#Page_288'>288</a>] is equally applicable in the case of antimony.
Having ascertained that a grain and a half of tartar-emetic
applied to a wound constantly killed dogs in a period varying from
seventeen to thirty-six hours, if no treatment was employed,—he
administered to them in this way a dose varying from a grain and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>half to three grains, and by then giving diuretics effected a cure in
four out of five instances.<a id='r1164' /><a href='#f1164' class='c013'><sup>[1164]</sup></a></p>

<h5 class='c011'><i>Chloride of Antimony.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>The chloride of antimony [sesquichloride, muriate, or butter of
antimony] being now put to little use and seldom seen except as an
intermediate product obtained in the preparation of other compounds
of antimony, it is rarely met with as the cause of poisoning, and
therefore scarcely deserves notice here, were it not that its effects
differ widely from those of tartar-emetic and other antimonials.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is easily known by the characters mentioned above. It has not
yet been made the subject of investigation by experiments on the
lower animals. Mr. Taylor has collected three cases of poisoning
with it, which show that it is a powerful corrosive and irritant, and
that its effects, as hitherto witnessed, seem to depend entirely on
this action. In one instance, that of a boy, twelve years old, who
swallowed four or five drachms of the solution by mistake for ginger-beer, the symptoms were vomiting in half an hour, then faintness and
extreme feebleness, and next day heat in the mouth and throat, difficulty
in swallowing, slight abrasions of the lining membrane of the
mouth, and general fever; but he got quite well in eight days. In
the case of another boy, ten years old, who got about the same
quantity by mistake for antimonial wine, there was an immediate
sense of choking and inability to speak, then vomiting and pain in
the throat, next a general state of collapse, with dilated pupils and
a tendency to stupor, and on the subsequent day bright scarlet patches
on the throat, with difficulty of swallowing. This patient also recovered
completely in a few days. The third was the case of a
surgeon who took intentionally between two and three fluid ounces,
and was found in an hour by his medical attendant in a state of great
prostration, and affected with severe efforts to vomit, violent griping,
and urgent tenesmus. Reaction soon ensued, the pain abated, and
the pulse rose to 120; a strong tendency to doze succeeded; and in
ten hours and a half he expired. The whole inside of the alimentary
canal, from the mouth to the jejunum, was black as if charred; the
mucous membrane seemed to have been removed along the whole of
this extent of the canal; and the submucous and peritoneal coats
were so soft as to be easily torn with the finger.<a id='r1165' /><a href='#f1165' class='c013'><sup>[1165]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING WITH TIN, SILVER, GOLD, BISMUTH, CHROME, ZINC, AND IRON.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>Several other metallic compounds produce effects analogous to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>those of the preparations of arsenic, copper, mercury, and antimony.
But they may be passed over shortly; because they are little known
as poisons, and it is therefore only necessary that their leading properties
be mentioned. They are the compounds of tin, silver, gold,
bismuth, chrome, zinc, and iron.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Tin.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The chlorides of <i>tin</i> are used in the arts of colour-making and
dyeing, and the oxide of tin forms part of the putty-powder used for
staining glass and polishing silver plate.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are two chlorides, the protochloride and bichloride. They
both form acicular crystals, which are very soluble. It is needless
to notice their tests or chemical history; but in order that the following
account of their effects on man and animals may be understood,
it is necessary to mention, that they are decomposed by almost all
vegetable infusions and animal fluids.</p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila found, that a solution of six grains of the protochloride injected
into the jugular vein of a dog killed it in one minute,—that
two grains caused death by tetanus in fifteen minutes,—and that
so small a quantity as half a grain caused death in twelve hours, the
only symptoms being somnolency and catalepsy or fixedness of
position.</p>

<p class='c006'>To these dreadful effects when introduced into the blood, its effects
when swallowed are not nearly proportionate. From eighteen to
forty-four grains killed dogs in one, two, or three days, efforts to
vomit and great depression being the only symptoms; and after
death the stomach was found excessively inflamed, and sometimes
ulcerated. Its effects when applied externally are still less violent.
Two drachms applied to a wound merely caused violent inflammation
and sloughing of the part, and death in twelve days, without
any internal symptom during life or appearance after death.<a id='r1166' /><a href='#f1166' class='c013'><sup>[1166]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>These phenomena, considered along with the violent symptoms
excited when the poison is injected into the veins, show that, when
swallowed or applied outwardly, it acts only as a local irritant.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tin is absorbed in the course of its action, and may be detected in
the liver, spleen, and urine, by boiling them in water acidulated with
hydrochloric acid, evaporating the decoction to dryness, charring the
residue by means of nitric acid as directed for copper, treating the
carbonaceous mass with a mixture of twenty parts of hydrochloric
acid and one of nitric acid, evaporating the solution to dryness so as
to expel any excess of acid, dissolving what is left in hydrochloric
acid diluted with twice its volume of water, and then transmitting
hydrosulphuric acid gas. If the precipitated sulphuret of tin has not
a fine yellow colour, it must be heated with a little strong nitric acid;
after which, if the residuum be again dissolved in diluted hydrochloric
acid, a characteristic yellow bisulphuret will be thrown down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>by hydrosulphuric acid gas. This process may be applied to all organic
mixtures containing tin.<a id='r1167' /><a href='#f1167' class='c013'><sup>[1167]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The oxide of tin, according to Schubarth, is quite inactive; for he
gave an entire drachm to a dog without being able to observe any
effect from it whatever.<a id='r1168' /><a href='#f1168' class='c013'><sup>[1168]</sup></a> This is what would be expected from its
extreme insolubility. Yet Orfila has stated in the early editions of
his Toxicology, and repeats in that of 1843, but without noticing the
contradictory observations of Schubarth, that one or two drachms of
the oxide occasion in dogs all the phenomena of irritant poisoning,
and prove invariably fatal.<a id='r1169' /><a href='#f1169' class='c013'><sup>[1169]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The metal has been proved by Bayen and Charlard to be inactive.<a id='r1170' /><a href='#f1170' class='c013'><sup>[1170]</sup></a>
It has been given expressly to dogs without any effect being observed;
and it is given in large doses to man for worms, without detriment.
No importance therefore can be attached to some alleged
cases of poisoning with this metal.<a id='r1171' /><a href='#f1171' class='c013'><sup>[1171]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Cases of poisoning with the preparations of tin are rare. Orfila
briefly notices a set of cases which occurred to M. Guersent. Several
persons in a family took the protochloride, in consequence of the
cook having mistaken a packet of it for salt and dressed their dinner
with it. They had all colic, some of them diarrhœa; none vomited;
and all recovered in a few days.<a id='r1172' /><a href='#f1172' class='c013'><sup>[1172]</sup></a> A case is related in the Medical
Times of death apparently caused by so small a quantity as half a
tea-spoonful of a solution of protochloride. The effects were vomiting,
acute pain in the stomach, anxiety, restlessness, thirst, and a
frequent, hard, small pulse. These symptoms increased next day;
and on the third day death took place, preceded by delirium.<a id='r1173' /><a href='#f1173' class='c013'><sup>[1173]</sup></a> As
this was a case of suicide, it is probable that some other poison, or
a larger dose of the chloride of tin was taken.</p>

<p class='c006'>Little need be said of the morbid appearances. Besides the signs
of violent irritation caused by the poisons of tin in common with other
irritants, Orfila always found in dogs a peculiar tanned appearance of
the villous coat of the stomach. In the case from the Medical Times
the gullet was red, the stomach inflamed externally, and internally
thickened, vascular, and pulpy.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Silver.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Of the preparations of <i>silver</i>, the only one which requires notice is
the nitrate or lunar caustic.</p>

<p class='c006'>It exists in two forms,—crystallized in broad, transparent, colourless
tables,—and fused into cylindrical, crystalline, grayish pencils.
Both forms are essentially the same in chemical nature.—The
most convenient tests are, 1, <i>Hydrochloric acid</i>, or any hydrochlorate,
which even in a state of extreme dilution causes with it a dense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>white precipitate, passing, under exposure to light, into dark brown;
and 2, <i>Ammonia</i>, followed by the solution of oxide of arsenic; if
the nitrate of silver is not too much diluted it gives a dark brown
precipitate with ammonia, soluble, however, in an excess of that
alkali; and when the solution has thus been restored, arsenic throws
down a lively yellow precipitate, passing rapidly to brown, if left
exposed to the light.</p>

<p class='c006'>Most organic substances, but in particular all animal fluids, with
the exception of gelatin, decompose nitrate of silver.</p>

<p class='c006'>It appears from the experiments of Orfila, that, like the chlorides
of tin, the nitrate of silver is a deadly poison when introduced into
the veins; but that, by reason of its facility of decomposition, it cannot
enter the blood through ordinary channels in a quantity sufficient
to develope any remote action. When two grains in solution were
injected into the jugular vein of a dog it died in six minutes, difficult
respiration being the chief symptom; the third part of a grain
caused death in four hours and a half, violent tetanus having preceded
death; and in both animals the blood in the heart was found
very black and the lungs gorged, or vivid red. According to Mr.
Blake, the salts of silver when directly introduced into the blood,
do not act on the heart, but operate by causing obstruction of the
capillary system. If they are injected into the aorta, the systemic
capillaries are obstructed, the nervous system is consequently oppressed,
respiration is arrested through the medium of this nervous
oppression, and death takes place by asphyxia, the heart continuing
to beat vigorously. If again they are injected into a great vein, immediate
obstruction of the pulmonary capillaries takes place, so that
the blood ceases to be transmitted to the left side of the heart.<a id='r1174' /><a href='#f1174' class='c013'><sup>[1174]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>To the violent action exerted by nitrate of silver when directly
admitted into the blood, its effects through the medium of the stomach
bear no proportion or resemblance. Thus, when twelve grains of
the salt were introduced into the stomach in the solid state, its effects
were so slight as not to be distinguishable from those of the ligature on
the gullet practised to prevent its discharge by vomiting. When introduced
in a state of solution, however, and in a larger dose, in the
dose of 36 grains, for example, it is more energetic. Death ensued
in thirty-six hours, but without any particular symptoms; and in the
dead body the villous coat of the stomach was found generally softened,
and corroded near the pylorus by little grayish eschars like
those formed by this poison on the skin.<a id='r1175' /><a href='#f1175' class='c013'><sup>[1175]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Hence it appears that nitrate of silver does not act remotely, but
simply as a local irritant and corrosive. The corrosion it produces is
incompatible with its absorption in large quantity. This inference
is confirmed by the experiments of Schloepfer, on its effects when
introduced into the trachea. He found that it caused inflammation
of the windpipe, and pneumonia passing on to hepatization of the
lungs, but no symptom referrible to a remote action.<a id='r1176' /><a href='#f1176' class='c013'><sup>[1176]</sup></a> Its pure corrosive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>properties have long pointed it out to the surgeon as the most
convenient of all escharotics.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nitrate of silver is absorbed, however, in the course of its action.
It would seem to be absorbed when it is taken medicinally in frequent
small doses. It is not easy to account otherwise for the singular
blueness of the skin, sometimes observed after the protracted
use of lunar caustic as a remedy for epilepsy and other diseases.<a id='r1177' /><a href='#f1177' class='c013'><sup>[1177]</sup></a>
The effects of the poison on the constitution in such cases are not
very well known. It appears, however, that considerable doses may
be taken for a great length of time without injury, and that the first
and only unpleasant effects produced by its too free administration
are such as indicate simply an injury of the stomach. The only exception
to this general statement I have met with is a case by Wedemeyer,
where, after the remedy had been taken for six months on
account of epilepsy, that disease disappeared, and dropsy, with diseased
liver at the same time commenced, and soon proved fatal. It
is probable, however, that the nitrate of silver had no share in the
ultimate event. In this instance the whole internal organs were
more or less blue; and metallic silver, it is said, was found in the
pancreas, and in the choroid plexus of the brain.<a id='r1178' /><a href='#f1178' class='c013'><sup>[1178]</sup></a> Silver has been
found in the urine of persons who were taking it medicinally. A
young man who had used the nitrate for some time observed that his
urine became muddy soon after being passed, and that the sediment
became black if exposed to the light; and when the sediment was
digested in ammonia, chloride of silver was detached by neutralizing
the ammoniacal liquor.<a id='r1179' /><a href='#f1179' class='c013'><sup>[1179]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>But it also appears that some nitrate of silver is absorbed when it
is given in a single large dose. For in animals poisoned with it
Orfila found that silver may be detected in the liver and spleen by
charring these organs with nitric acid as in the instance of poisoning
with copper, and then treating the residue with boiling diluted nitric
acid, and adding hydrochloric acid to the solution. He also found
silver in the urine by charring the extract with heat, acting on the
charcoal with ammonia, and saturating the filtered ammoniacal solution,—chloride
of silver being then detached.<a id='r1180' /><a href='#f1180' class='c013'><sup>[1180]</sup></a> These results
have been confirmed by the experiments of Drs. Panizza and Kramer
of Milan,<a id='r1181' /><a href='#f1181' class='c013'><sup>[1181]</sup></a> who found silver in the blood after the administration both
of the nitrate and chloride.</p>

<p class='c006'>Boerhaave has noticed a case of poisoning with this substance, but
in very brief terms. He says it caused gangrene. Schloepfer in his
thesis notices a case by Dr. Albers of Bremen in which croup was
brought on by a bit of lunar caustic dropping into the windpipe. M.
Poumarede has related an instance of poisoning with an ounce of
nitrate of silver in solution. A few hours afterwards the individual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>was found insensible, with the eyes turned up, the pupils dilated, the
jaws locked, and the arms and face agitated with convulsions. A
solution of common salt was immediately given as an antidote. In
two hours there was some return of consciousness, and abatement of
the convulsions, but still complete insensibility of the limbs, with
redness of the features, and pain in the stomach. In eleven hours
he could articulate. For thirty-six hours he continued subject to fits
of protracted coma; but he eventually recovered. Sixteen hours
after taking the poison he vomited a large quantity of chloride of
silver.<a id='r1182' /><a href='#f1182' class='c013'><sup>[1182]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The treatment of poisoning with the nitrate of silver is obvious.
The muriate of soda by decomposing it will act as an antidote; and
any signs of irritation left will be subdued by opium.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Gold.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'><i>Gold</i> in various states of combination was at one time much
used in medicine, and an attempt has been lately made to revive its
employment.</p>

<p class='c006'>Its poisonous properties are powerful, and closely allied to those
of the chlorides of tin and nitrate of silver. In the state of chloride
it occasions death in three or four minutes when injected into the
veins, even in very minute doses; and the lungs are found after
death so turgid as to sink in water. But if swallowed, corrosion
takes place; the salt is so rapidly decomposed, that none is taken up
by the absorbents; and death ensues simply from the local injury.<a id='r1183' /><a href='#f1183' class='c013'><sup>[1183]</sup></a>
It has been of late used in medicine in France as an antisyphilitic;
but even doses so small as a tenth of a grain have been known to
produce an unpleasant degree of irritation in the stomach.<a id='r1184' /><a href='#f1184' class='c013'><sup>[1184]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In the state of fulminating gold, this metal has given rise to alarming
poisoning in former times, when it was used medicinally. Plenck
in his Toxicologia says it excites griping, diarrhœa, vomiting, convulsions,
fainting, salivation; and sometimes has proved fatal.<a id='r1185' /><a href='#f1185' class='c013'><sup>[1185]</sup></a> Hoffmann
likewise repeatedly saw it prove fatal, and the most remarkable
symptoms were vomiting, great anxiety and fainting. In one of his
cases the dose was only six grains.<a id='r1186' /><a href='#f1186' class='c013'><sup>[1186]</sup></a> These compounds are now so
little met with that they need not be noticed in greater detail.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Bismuth.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'><i>Bismuth</i>, in its saline combinations, is also an active poison. One
of its compounds, the trisnitrate, white bismuth, or magistery of bismuth,
is a good deal used in medicine and the arts; and pearl
white, one of the paints used in the cosmetic art, is the tartrate of this
metal.</p>

<p class='c006'>The former substance is an active poison. It is got by dissolving
bismuth in nitric acid, and pouring hot water over the crystals; a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>supernitrate being left in solution, and the trisnitrate thrown down in
the form of a white powder.</p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila found that the soluble part of fifteen grains of the nitrate,
when injected into the jugular vein of a dog, caused immediate giddiness
and staggering, and death in eight minutes. He also remarked
that forty grains mixed with water and introduced into the
stomach, caused all the customary signs of irritation, and death in
twenty-four hours; and that a great part of the villous coat of the
stomach was reduced to a pulpy mass, and likewise exhibited several
ulcers.<a id='r1187' /><a href='#f1187' class='c013'><sup>[1187]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Similar effects were produced by the trisnitrate; but a larger dose
was required. Two drachms and a half killed a dog in twenty-four
hours; and redness and eroded spots were found in the stomach.</p>

<p class='c006'>In some more recent researches Orfila found that the poison is absorbed,
and may be detected, like other metallic poisons, in the
liver, spleen, and urine. The process for this purpose, applicable
also to all organic mixtures, consists in boiling the solids in water
acidulated with a twentieth of nitric acid, evaporating the solution to
dryness, charring the residue with nitric acid, as directed for copper,
boiling the charcoal in diluted nitric acid, and thus obtaining an acid
solution of nitrate of bismuth, which may be known by the effects of
water and of hydrosulphuric acid.<a id='r1188' /><a href='#f1188' class='c013'><sup>[1188]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila remarks, that Camerarius of Tübingen once detected the
adulteration of wine with the oxide of bismuth, and that the bakers
in some parts of England used to render their bread white and heavy
by mixing the trisnitrate with flour; but he has not stated his authority
for this accusation. It may be discovered in any such mixture
by calcining the suspected substance in a crucible, and then separating
the metallic bismuth by means of nitric acid. But the adulteration
of bread with bismuth is very questionable, as there are many
cheaper methods for effecting the purpose, without adding any thing
positively deleterious.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following is the only case with which I am acquainted of
poisoning with the preparations of bismuth in the human subject.
A man subject to water-brash took two drachms of the trisnitrate
with a little cream of tartar by mistake for a mixture of chalk and
magnesia. He was immediately attacked with burning in the throat,
brown vomiting, watery purging, cramps, and coldness of the limbs,
and intermitting pulse, and then with inflammation of the throat, difficult
swallowing, dryness of the membrane of the nose, and a constant
nauseous metallic taste. On the third day he had hiccup, laborious
breathing, and swelling of the hands and face; and suppression
of urine was then discovered to have existed from the first. On the
fourth day swelling and tension of the belly were added to the pre-existing
symptoms, on the fifth day salivation, on the sixth delirium,
on the seventh, swelling of the tongue and enormous enlargement of
the belly; and on the ninth he expired. The urine continued suppressed
till the eighth day.—On inspection of the body it was found
that from the back of the mouth to the rectum there were but few points
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>of the alimentary canal free of disease. The tonsils, uvula, pharynx,
and epiglottis, were gangrenous, the larynx spotted black, the gullet
livid, the stomach very red, with numerous purple pimples, the
whole intestinal canal red, and here and there gangrenous, especially
at the rectum. The inner surface of the heart was bright red. The
kidneys and brain were healthy.<a id='r1189' /><a href='#f1189' class='c013'><sup>[1189]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Chrome.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The next metal whose properties deserve notice is <i>chrome</i>. As it
is now extensively used in the art of dyeing it is necessary to mention
its effects, more especially as they are singular. They have
been ascertained experimentally with great care by Professor Gmelin
of Tübingen. He found that in the dose of a grain the <i>chromate of
potass</i> had no effect when injected into the jugular vein of a dog,—that
four grains produced constant vomiting, and death in six days
without any other striking symptom,—and that ten grains caused
instant death by paralysing the heart. Its effects, when introduced
under the skin, are still more remarkable. It seems to cause general
inflammation of the lining membrane of the air-passages. When a
drachm was thrust in the state of powder under the skin of the neck
of a dog, the first symptoms were weariness and a disinclination to
eat. But on the second day the animal vomited, and a purulent
matter was discharged from the eyes. On the third day it became
palsied in the hind legs; on the fourth it could not breathe or swallow
but with great difficulty; and on the sixth it died. The wound was
not much inflamed; but the larynx, bronchi, and minute ramifications
of the air tubes contained fragments of fibrinous effusion, the nostrils
were full of similar matter, and the conjunctiva of the eyes was
covered with mucus. In another dog, an eruption appeared on the
back, and the hair fell off.<a id='r1190' /><a href='#f1190' class='c013'><sup>[1190]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The effects of the salts of chrome on man have not been well ascertained,
but seem to be peculiar. Dr. Schindler of Greifenberg relates
the following case of fatal poisoning with bichromate of potash.
A colourman having swallowed a solution of it, vomiting was brought
on by warm water, soap and oil, and kept up until the discharges
ceased to be yellow. The man got apparently well and passed a
quiet night; but next morning he felt excessively weary, had stitches
in his back and kidneys, passed no urine, and was affected with
purging. A restless night followed. On the subsequent morning,
he lay motionless and like one fatigued to the extremest degree; in
which state he died, fifty-four hours after swallowing the poison.
The stomach was healthy, the intestines reddish, the kidneys gorged
with blood and marbled internally with dark-red patches, and the
bladder empty.<a id='r1191' /><a href='#f1191' class='c013'><sup>[1191]</sup></a>—Mr. Wilson of Leeds has described the case of
an elderly man who took the poison in the evening, and was found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>dead about twelve hours afterwards, without any sign of vomiting,
purging, or convulsions; and no morbid appearance was found but
redness of the villous coat of the stomach, and an inky-like fluid in
it, containing a large quantity of bichromate of potash.<a id='r1192' /><a href='#f1192' class='c013'><sup>[1192]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>To these facts may be added another not less singular, which my
late colleague Dr. Duncan informed me has been observed by the
workmen in Glasgow, who use the bichromate of potass in dyeing.
When this salt was first introduced into the art of dyeing, the
workmen who had their hands often immersed in its solution were
attacked with troublesome sores on the parts touched by it; and the
sores gradually extended deeper and deeper, without spreading, till
they sometimes actually made their way through the arm or hand
altogether.<a id='r1193' /><a href='#f1193' class='c013'><sup>[1193]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Zinc.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The compounds of <i>zinc</i>, which have been long used in considerable
doses in medicine, have sometimes occasioned serious and even
fatal effects. Partly on this account, and partly because one of them,
the sulphate of zinc, being the emetic most commonly used in the
treatment of poisoning, is apt to complicate various medico-legal analyses,
it will be proper to notice both its physiological properties and
the mode of detecting it by chemical means.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only important compound of this metal is the sulphate or
<i>white vitriol</i>. As usually sold in the shops, it forms small, prismatic
crystals, transparent, colourless, of a very styptic metallic taste, and
exceedingly soluble in water. That which is kept by the apothecary
is tolerably pure; but there is a salt sometimes met with in commerce
which contains an admixture of sulphate of iron, and with which the
natural action of the tests for zinc is materially modified.</p>

<p class='c006'>The solution of the pure salt is precipitated white by the <i>caustic
alkalis</i>, an oxide being thrown down, which is soluble in an excess
of ammonia. The <i>alkaline carbonates</i> also precipitate it white, the
carbonate of ammonia being the most delicate of these reagents. The
precipitate is soluble in an excess of carbonate of ammonia, and is
not thrown down again by boiling. The precipitate produced both
by the alkalis and by their carbonates becomes yellow, when heated
nearly to redness; and on cooling it becomes again white. This is
a characteristic property, by which the oxide of zinc may be known
from most white powders. But oxide of antimony is similarly affected.
The <i>ferro-cyanate of potass</i> also causes a white precipitate. A
stream of <i>sulphuretted-hydrogen</i> likewise causes a white precipitate,
the sulphuret of zinc, the colour of which distinguishes the present
genus of poisons from all those previously mentioned, as well as from
the poisons of lead. The precipitate is apt to be suspended till the
excess of gas is expelled by ebullition. The action of this test will
not distinguish sulphate of zinc from the salts of peroxide of iron, by
which white sulphur is disengaged from the gas in consequence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>the peroxide of iron being reduced to the state of protoxide. The
same decomposition takes place wherever there is free chlorine, as
in impure samples of muriatic or nitric acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the sulphate of zinc contains iron, the alkalis throw down a
greenish-white precipitate, the alkaline carbonates a grayish or reddish-white,
the ferro-cyanate of potass a light-blue, but sulphuretted-hydrogen
the usual white precipitate. Tincture of galls, which merely
renders the pure salt hazy, causes a deep violet coagulum if there is
any ferruginous impurity.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sulphate of zinc is acted on by albumen and milk precisely
in the same manner as the sulphate of copper. The salt is decomposed,
and the metallic oxide forms an insoluble compound with the
animal matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the sulphate of zinc has been mixed with vegetable and
animal substances, the action of the tests mentioned above is modified.
In such circumstances I have found the following process
convenient.</p>

<p class='c006'>The mixture being strained through gauze, it is to be acidulated
with acetic acid, and filtered through paper. The acetic acid dissolves
any oxide of zinc that may have been thrown down in union
with animal matter. The filtered fluid is then to be evaporated to a
convenient extent, and treated when cool with sulphuretted-hydrogen
gas,—upon which a grayish or white milkiness or precipitate
will be formed. The excess of gas must now be expelled by boiling,
and the precipitate washed by the process of subsidence and
affusion, and collected on a filter. It is then to be dried and heated
to redness in a tube. When it has cooled, it is to be acted on by
strong nitric acid, which dissolves the zinc and leaves the sulphur.
The nitrous solution should next be diluted, and neutralized with
carbonate of ammonia; after which the liquid tests formerly mentioned
will act characteristically. The effect of carbonate of ammonia, and
that of heat on the carbonate of zinc which is thrown down, ought to
be particularly relied on.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have tried this process with the matter vomited after the administration
of sulphate of zinc, in a case of pretended poisoning, and found
it to answer exceedingly well.</p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila has lately suggested the following method. Boil the suspected
substance in water, evaporate the filtered decoction to dryness,
char the residuum with nitric acid as directed for copper in
similar circumstances, digest the charcoal in diluted muriatic acid, and
subject the filtered solution to hydrosulphuric acid. If the sulphuret
be not white, but yellowish from iron, heat it with strong nitric acid,
dry the product, and heat it to redness; dissolve it in weak nitric
acid; throw down the oxide of iron by an excess of ammonia, which
retains the oxide of zinc; and then having filtered the fluid, separate
the oxide of zinc by neutralizing the ammonia.<a id='r1194' /><a href='#f1194' class='c013'><sup>[1194]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila has furnished the only accurate information hitherto possessed
regarding the effects of sulphate of zinc on the animal system.<a id='r1195' /><a href='#f1195' class='c013'><sup>[1195]</sup></a> He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>found that dogs might be made to swallow 7½ drachms without any
permanent harm being sustained, provided they were allowed to
vomit; for in a few seconds the whole poison was invariably discharged,
and the animals, after appearing to suffer for four or five
hours, gradually recovered their usual liveliness. But the result is
different if the gullet be tied: violent efforts to vomit ensue, and death
follows in three days, the intermediate phenomena being those of
local irritation chiefly, and the appearances in the dead body those of
incipient inflammation of the stomach, without corrosion.—When
injected into the veins, the effect of sulphate of zinc is much more
violent, in an inferior dose. Forty-eight grains occasioned almost
instant death; and half the quantity proved fatal in three minutes.
Orfila does not appear to have ascertained the cause of death in the
last two experiments. But Mr. Blake found that when this salt is
injected into the veins in the dose of three grains, it causes some depression
of the heart; that thirty grains arrest the action of the heart
in eight seconds, leaving that organ exhausted of irritability and full
of florid blood in its left cavities; and that when injected into the
arterial system in the dose of sixteen grains, it seemed not to cause
any obstruction of the capillaries, but to act on the nervous system,
producing extreme prostration, without insensibility or convulsions.<a id='r1196' /><a href='#f1196' class='c013'><sup>[1196]</sup></a>
These experiments, when taken together, show that sulphate of zinc,
though a moderately active irritant, is more indebted for its activity
to a remote operation on some vital organ.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sulphate of zinc is absorbed in the course of its action; for Orfila
has lately found it by his process for complex mixtures in the spleen,
liver, and urine of animals.<a id='r1197' /><a href='#f1197' class='c013'><sup>[1197]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The effects of the preparations of zinc on man in large doses have
not been particularly studied. In the dose of a scruple or a drachm,
the sulphate is the most immediate emetic known; and it is to be
inferred, that if larger doses are rejected, as is the fact, with equal
rapidity, they will in general cause no more harm than the medicinal
dose.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nevertheless, some people have suffered severely from over-doses
of sulphate of zinc, and a few have even perished. Instead of presenting
here a general view of the symptoms, it will be preferable to
relate the heads of such cases as have been published.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first to be mentioned is related by Foderé, who, in consequence
of the violent symptoms produced, assigns to the present
poison very active properties. “A patient of mine,” says he, “a
custom-house officer, having got from a druggist six grains of sulphate
of zinc to cure a gonorrhœa, was attacked with inflammation in the
lower belly, attended by retraction of the navel and severe colic,
which yielded only to repeated blood-letting, general as well as local,
oleaginous emollients, opiates, and the warm bath.”<a id='r1198' /><a href='#f1198' class='c013'><sup>[1198]</sup></a> This case is
noticed here chiefly to prevent any one from being misled by it, as it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>has been quoted by other medico-legal authors. For assuredly some
other cause must have co-operated before such symptoms could arise;
since I have in many cases given the same dose thrice daily for several
days, without ever observing more than slight sickness; and
Dr. Babington once gave thirty-six grains thrice a day for some weeks
with as little effect.<a id='r1199' /><a href='#f1199' class='c013'><sup>[1199]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Parmentier, the chemist, met with an instance, in which about two
ounces of white vitriol in solution were swallowed by mistake. The
countenance became immediately pale, the extremities cold, the
eyes dull, and the pulse fluttering. The patient, a young lady, then
complained of a burning pain in the stomach, and vomited violently.
But potass being now administered in syrup, the pain ceased, the
vomiting gradually abated, and the lady soon recovered completely.<a id='r1200' /><a href='#f1200' class='c013'><sup>[1200]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In the Journal de Médecine, another instance is related by M.
Schueler, in which a very large dose did not produce material injury.
The symptoms were pain in the stomach and bowels, with vomiting
and diarrhœa. They were dispelled in a few hours by the administration
of cream, butter, and chalk.<a id='r1201' /><a href='#f1201' class='c013'><sup>[1201]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The following is a fatal case recorded by Metzger, but it is not a
pure example of poisoning with zinc, though accounted such by the
relater; for a small quantity of sulphate of copper was mixed with
the sulphate of zinc. Three persons in a family took this mixture,
which had been given them by a grocer in mistake for pounded
sugar. They were all seized with violent vomiting; and a boy twelve
years of age died in less than twelve hours.<a id='r1202' /><a href='#f1202' class='c013'><sup>[1202]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Another and an unequivocal case has been lately recorded in Horn’s
Archiv from Mertzdorff’s experience. No part of the history of the
symptoms is mentioned, except that there had been vomiting. But
Mertzdorff has described carefully the morbid appearances, which
are interesting; and he detected the poison in the stomach by a
satisfactory analysis.<a id='r1203' /><a href='#f1203' class='c013'><sup>[1203]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Two other cases, which are presumed to have arisen from the commercial
sulphate of zinc, and which proved fatal, have been recently
published by Dr. Sartorius of Aachen; but they do not appear to me
to have been satisfactorily traced to this poison, and it is therefore
unnecessary to quote them.<a id='r1204' /><a href='#f1204' class='c013'><sup>[1204]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Werres of Cologne has related the particulars of three cases of
poisoning with some preparation of zinc in milk-porridge. One of
the persons, a child four years old, was seized with vomiting in three
minutes, and, after frequent violent returns of it, died in convulsions
within eight hours. The others also suffered severely from vomiting,
but recovered.<a id='r1205' /><a href='#f1205' class='c013'><sup>[1205]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It does not appear that workmen who are exposed to the fumes of
zinc ever suffer materially. But there is a case in Rust’s Magazin,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>which shows that these fumes are not quite harmless. An apothecary’s
assistant, while preparing philosopher’s wool, incautiously filled
the whole laboratory with it. The same day he was seized with
tightness in the chest, headache and giddiness; next morning with
violent cough, vomiting, and stillness of the limbs; on the third day
with a coppery taste in the mouth, some salivation, gripes, and such
an increase of giddiness that he could not stand. He was then freely
purged, after which a fever set in, ending in perspiration; and he
got well in three weeks.<a id='r1206' /><a href='#f1206' class='c013'><sup>[1206]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>From these cases, and the experimental researches of Orfila, it is
clear that the preparations of zinc, though not very active poisons,
are nevertheless far from being innocuous. We are not acquainted
with their effects when long and habitually introduced into the body
in small quantities. About the time when physicians began to study
with care the dangerous consequences of employing lead and copper
in the manufacture of culinary vessels, it was conceived by some that
zinc might prove a safe substitute. It was farther imagined by some
military economists in France, that zinc might be profitably used instead
of tinned iron in the manufacture of canteens and other articles
of camp equipage, because the worn and damaged vessels would
sell as old metal at little short of their original price, while tinned
iron as old metal bears no value at all. But from the experiments of
Deyeux and Vauquelin it subsequently appeared, that in the course
of many culinary operations zinc is more liable to be attacked than
either copper or lead;—that water left for some time in zinc vessels
oxidates them, and acquires a metallic taste;—that if water acidulated
with vinegar or lemon-juice is boiled in zinc, a solution is
formed, in which the metal may be detected by its tests;—and that
sea-salt, sal-ammoniac, and even butter, have the power of dissolving
it also.<a id='r1207' /><a href='#f1207' class='c013'><sup>[1207]</sup></a> Some singular inquiries were afterwards prosecuted by
Devaux and Dejaer among the Spanish prisoners at Liége, with the
view of proving, that frequent small quantities of zinc dissolved in
the manner mentioned, and habitually taken with the food, have no
injurious tendency; that even in large doses it can hardly be accounted
poisonous, as it merely gives rise to vomiting and slight diarrhœa;
and that an adulteration to such an amount would always
betray itself by its strong disagreeable taste.<a id='r1208' /><a href='#f1208' class='c013'><sup>[1208]</sup></a> These are certainly
valuable facts, though not quite satisfactory. But it is unnecessary
to inquire minutely into their validity; for, independently of all
other considerations, vessels constructed of zinc are too brittle for
domestic purposes. With regard to the effects of frequent small doses
of sulphate of zinc, the only positive information I can communicate
is, that I have often given medicinally from three to six grains thrice
a day for two or three weeks, without observing any particular effect
except in some persons sickness when the largest doses were taken;
and others have frequently made the same observation.<a id='r1209' /><a href='#f1209' class='c013'><sup>[1209]</sup></a> On the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>other hand, Dr. Nasse of Berlin says a patient of his, who had taken
twenty grains of oxide of zinc daily till 3247 grains were swallowed,
was attacked with paleness, emaciation, weakness of intellect, obstinate
constipation, coldness and œdema of the limbs, extreme dryness
of the skin, and a thready scarcely perceptible pulse. But he
quickly recovered under the use of laxatives and tonics.<a id='r1210' /><a href='#f1210' class='c013'><sup>[1210]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Sulphate of zinc is said to have proved fatal when applied externally.
In Pyl’s memoirs there is a case of this nature, which was
attributed to sulphate of zinc having been used as a lotion for a scabby
eruption on the head. The subject was a child, six years old, and
otherwise healthy. The wash, which was a vinous solution, had not
been long applied before the child complained of acute burning pain
of the head, which was followed by vomiting, purging, convulsions,
and death in five hours. The cause of these symptoms, though the
particulars of the case were ascertained judicially by an able medical
jurist, Dr. Opitz of Minden, is nevertheless very doubtful, as daily
use is made of the salt for similar purposes without any such effect.
Appearances of congestive apoplexy were found within the skull;
and the reporter ascribes death to the wash having produced repulsion
of the cutaneous disease, and determination of blood to the
head.<a id='r1211' /><a href='#f1211' class='c013'><sup>[1211]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The only opportunities which have occurred of observing the morbid
appearances after poisoning with sulphate of zinc taken internally,
are the cases by Metzger, Mertzdorff, and Werres.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first, which was a mixed case, the only appearances of note
were slight inflammation in the stomach, and excessive gorging of the
lungs with fluid blood; from which Metzger oddly enough concludes
that the child was suffocated by the vomiting. In the second case,
Mertzdorff found the stomach and intestines, but particularly the
latter, contracted,—their outer surface healthy—the inner membrane
of the stomach grayish-green, with several spots of effused blood,
and greenish, fluid contents,—the inner membrane of the small intestines
similarly spotted,—the rest of the body quite natural. It
has been already mentioned that Mertzdorff detected the poison in
the body. He found it not only in the contents, but likewise in the
coats of the stomach and intestines. In the third, Werres found a
reddish-brown patch and some vascularity in the stomach.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Iron.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>In previous editions of this work the preparations of iron were
arranged among those substances which are not usually considered
poisonous, but which may nevertheless prove injurious when taken in
large quantity. But the soluble salts of iron, although not very active,
seem sufficiently so to entitle them to a regular place among poisons;
and one of them, the sulphate, has actually been used, as will presently
appear, for the purpose of committing murder.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>There are many soluble salts of iron which in all probability may
prove hurtful; but the only ones which have been brought under
notice in medico-legal researches are the sulphate of the protoxide,
and the mixed chlorides.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sulphate of the protoxide of iron, commonly called green vitriol
or copperas, occurs in commerce in crystals or crystalline
masses of various shades of bluish-green. It is easily known by its
colour and its strong styptic inky taste. When in solution, the iron
may be detected by ferro-cyanate of potash, sulphuretted-hydrogen,
and tincture of galls. Ferro-cyanate of potash causes a blue precipitate,
at first pale, but gradually passing to deep Prussian blue.
Sulphuretted-hydrogen has no effect, but if an alkali, such as ammonia,
be added to disengage the oxide of iron, a black precipitate of sulphuret
of iron is immediately produced. Tincture of galls occasions
a deep purplish-black precipitate, the tannate of iron, and it acts
with greater delicacy in very diluted solutions, if the oxide of iron be
disengaged by carbonate of soda. These tests prove the presence of
iron in solution. A white precipitate under the action of nitrate of
baryta will indicate that the oxide is dissolved by sulphuric acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>The most familiar form of chloride of iron is the tincture of the
chloride, which sometimes contains only the sesquichloride, sometimes
consists of a mixture of this with the protochloride. It is
known by the three tests for oxide of iron described above, and by
nitrate of silver occasioning a heavy white precipitate, insoluble in
nitric acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>For detecting iron in organic mixtures, where the liquid reagents
do not act satisfactorily, the simplest process is to digest the mixture,
if there be any solid matter, in water acidulated with acetic
acid, to evaporate the filtered liquid to dryness, to incinerate the
extract in a porcelain crucible, to act on the product with diluted sulphuric
acid, and then to treat the solution with the three liquid reagents.</p>

<p class='c006'>Professor Gmelin found that sulphate of iron merely caused vomiting
in dogs who were made to swallow two drachms of it, that
rabbits might take forty grains without any apparent injury, and that
twenty grains in a state of solution might even be injected into the
veins of a dog without producing any particular symptom.<a id='r1212' /><a href='#f1212' class='c013'><sup>[1212]</sup></a> From
these and some other facts of the like kind it was generally held, that
sulphate of iron is not a poison. But Smith ascertained that a dose
of two drachms will prove fatal to dogs in little more than twenty-tour
hours, when it is introduced into the stomach, and in half that
time if applied to a wound; and that it occasions some redness of
the alimentary mucous membrane, and the effusion of a thick layer
of tough mucus. It is remarkable, however, that, like Gmelin, he
found no effect to flow from the transfusion of a solution of seven
grains into the veins, except transient vomiting and expressions of
pain.<a id='r1213' /><a href='#f1213' class='c013'><sup>[1213]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The effects which have been observed in the human subject are
conformable with those witnessed in experiments on the lower animals,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>the symptoms being those of pure irritant poisoning. Few
illustrative cases, however, have as yet been made public. In Rust’s
Journal there is the case of a girl, who took as an emmenagogue, an
ounce of green vitriol dissolved in beer, and suffered in consequence
from colic pains, constant vomiting and purging for seven hours, but
eventually recovered under the use of mucilaginous and oily drinks.<a id='r1214' /><a href='#f1214' class='c013'><sup>[1214]</sup></a>
A fatal case of poisoning with this substance occurs in the Parliamentary
Returns of death from poison in England during the years
1837–38 [see p. <a href='#Page_90'>90</a>].—Dr. Combe of Leith has communicated to
me an instructive case of fatal poisoning with the tincture of the
chloride of iron, which was taken to the extent of an ounce and a
half by a gardener accidentally instead of whisky. Violent pain in
the throat and stomach, tension and contraction of the epigastrium,
and nausea immediately ensued; afterwards coldness of the skin and
feebleness of the pulse were remarked; and then vomiting of an inky
fluid, with subsequently profuse vomiting of mucus and blood, and
also bloody stools under the use of laxatives. He remained for
some days in a very precarious state, but then began to rally, and in
three weeks resumed his occupation. But in two weeks more Dr.
Combe found him emaciated, cadaverous in appearance, and affected
with pains in the stomach, costiveness, and thirst; in which state he
lingered for five days more, and then died. In the dead body there
was found great thickening towards the pylorus, a cicatrized patch
there three inches long and two inches broad, and another large
patch of inflammatory redness surrounded by a white border. The
preparation taken in this instance contained a third of its volume
of hydrochloric acid and a tenth of its weight of oxide of iron; and
consequently some of the acid was free.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following remarkable case, in which I was lately consulted on
the part of the Crown, will show that sulphate of iron is a more
important poison than has been commonly thought. Suspicions having
arisen in December, 1840, respecting the death of a child in the
county of Fife about four months before, an investigation was made
by the law authorities; and the body was disinterred and inspected
by Mr. Dewar and Dr. James Dewar of Dunfermline. It was ascertained
that the child, a girl four years of age, and previously in good
health, was attacked with violent vomiting and purging immediately
after breakfasting on porridge, and died in the course of the afternoon
of the same day. A boy two years older, having seen a blue
solution put into the porridge, and observing that the porridge had
a bad taste, took only three spoonfuls of it, but became for a time
very sick. The girl, being fed by a woman in the house, was made
to take all her share; and in the course of the day the same person
was seen by two children of the family to give a blue solution to the
sick girl for drink. The woman was proved to have purchased
sulphate of copper, and admitted having bought about this time both
that salt and sulphate of iron, for the alleged purpose of dyeing some
clothes. Poisoning with sulphate of copper was therefore suspected.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>On examining the body, which had been buried four months, the
Messrs. Dewar found the external parts considerably decayed,—the
stomach soft, gelatinous, and of a uniform intense black colour
through the whole thickness of its parietes,—the gullet and duodenum
similarly affected, but not so deeply on their outer surface,—the
spleen, kidneys, and lower parts of the liver similarly stained with
a black pulp, which could be wiped off,—and the whole alimentary
canal lined with a thick layer of jet-black mucus, from the pharynx
down to the very anus. Inferring that the cause of this extraordinary
blackness was decomposition of sulphate of copper by hydrosulphuric
acid gas disengaged during the decay of the body, they proceeded
to search for that metal in the form of sulphuret both in the contents
and texture of the stomach, but without success: there was not a
trace of copper to be found. Being then led from some circumstances
in the analysis to suspect that the black matter might be
sulphuret of iron, they proceeded to search for that substance, and
ascertained that a large quantity existed both in the textures of the
stomach and in the black mucus which lined it. They further ascertained
that there was no iron in a state capable of being dissolved by
water, but that a much larger quantity of sulphuric acid was associated
with the black matter than could have proceeded from the sulphates
naturally contained in the animal textures or in the mucous secretions.
They had also an opportunity of examining several large buff-coloured
stains on various articles of dress, worn by the child and by the
woman at the time the poisoning was supposed to have happened;
and they detected a large quantity of oxide of iron in all of them.
The whole case was subsequently submitted to me for my opinion,
together with a portion of the stomach, the entire intestines, and
several stained articles of dress. The results of the analysis of the
tissues of the stomach, the black intestinal mucus, and the stains on
the cloth were the same in my hands.—It is not easy to see how
any other conclusion could be drawn from the whole circumstances,
than that a soluble preparation of iron had been administered a short
time before death, and that it had been entirely decomposed and
converted into sulphuret of iron by the evolution of hydrosulphate of
ammonia during the decay of the body. In consequence of important
defects in the evidence criminating a particular individual, and
especially because all the essential facts depended on the testimony
of children, who, after the lapse of some time, did not adhere to
their original statement, it was judged improper to bring this case to
a trial.</p>

<p class='c006'>A few years afterwards another case somewhat similar was submitted
by the law authorities to the same gentlemen, to whom I am
indebted for the particulars. A woman far advanced in pregnancy,
and enjoying excellent health, was suddenly seized about midnight
with vomiting and purging, and died in fourteen hours. Various
circumstances having raised suspicions as to the cause of death, the
body was disinterred a few days after burial, and carefully examined
by Mr. Dewar and Dr. Dewar. The organs were in general healthy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>There were some dark-red patches on the villous coat of the stomach,
and a general blush pervaded the whole alimentary canal, which was
empty of every thing but a reddish-brown mucus. The intestines
were in several places irregularly contracted and hard. The stomach,
small intestines, and rectum contained iron in large quantity, dissolved
either by sulphuric or hydrochloric acid. Sulphate of iron
was found in the house.—No trial took place in this instance either,
because there was a want of evidence to attach guilt to any particular
individual, although it was highly improbable that the woman had
taken the poison herself.<a id='r1215' /><a href='#f1215' class='c013'><sup>[1215]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>A short notice may here be added of the toxicological effects of
the rarer metals, which have been examined chiefly by Professor
Gmelin of Tübingen.<a id='r1216' /><a href='#f1216' class='c013'><sup>[1216]</sup></a>—Oxide of <i>osmium</i> is nearly as active as
arsenic, for a grain and a half will kill a dog in a few hours by the
stomach, and in one hour through a vein. Twelve grains of hydrochlorate
of <i>platinum</i> will kill a dog within a day through the stomach,
with symptoms of pure irritation; and so will half that quantity
through a vein.—The hydrochlorates of <i>iridium</i> and <i>rhodium</i> are
rather less active.—The hydrochlorate of <i>palladium</i> is equally
powerful when introduced into the stomach, and much more so
through a vein, for two-thirds of a grain will kill dogs in a minute.</p>

<p class='c006'>The salts of other metals appear less active.—<i>Molybdenum</i>, in the
form of molybdate of ammonia, seems a feeble poison; thirty grains
killed a rabbit in two hours, but produced in dogs merely some
vomiting and purging; and ten grains injected into the jugular vein
did not prove fatal.—<i>Manganese</i>, according to Gmelin, is likewise
a feeble poison, but has peculiar effects. A drachm of the sulphate
killed a rabbit in an hour. Thirty grains swallowed by a dog had
no effect. Two drachms thrust into the cellular tissue had no effect.
Twelve grains injected into a vein occasioned death in five days:
and in the dead body, the stomach, duodenum, and liver were found
much inflamed. Manganesic acid, according to Professor Hünefeld,
appears also to act on the liver, but is a feeble poison. A rabbit
received two drachms in three days in doses of ten or fifteen grains,
without presenting any symptom except increased flow of urine.
Being then killed, the liver was found soft, at one part bright red,
elsewhere dark-brownish-red, and it yielded manganese by incineration.<a id='r1217' /><a href='#f1217' class='c013'><sup>[1217]</sup></a>
Some singular observations have been lately published by
Dr. Couper of Glasgow, the purport of which is, that manganese
belongs to the class of insidious, cumulative poisons, and that it has
the property of slowly bringing on, in those who breathe or handle the
oxide, a paraplegic affection which is incurable unless taken under
treatment early. Five cases of the kind occurred subsequently to
1828, in the great chemical manufactory of Tennant and Company,
among the workmen employed in grinding the black oxide of manganese.<a id='r1218' /><a href='#f1218' class='c013'><sup>[1218]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>On the other hand, Dr. Thomson of Glasgow has recently
stated that an ounce of sulphate of manganese is an effectual and
safe laxative.<a id='r1219' /><a href='#f1219' class='c013'><sup>[1219]</sup></a> <i>Uranium</i> is an active poison when injected into a
vein, for three grains of the muriate proves fatal instantly; but dogs
may swallow fifteen, or from that to sixty grains without any other
effect except slight vomiting [Gmelin]. <i>Cobalt</i> is more active.
Thirty grains of the oxide occasion death in a few hours through the
stomach. Twenty-four grains of the muriate applied to the cellular
tissue excite vomiting. Three grains of sulphate injected into a vein
prove fatal in four days.—<i>Tungsten</i>, <i>cerium</i>, <i>cadmium</i>, <i>nickel</i>, and <i>titanium</i>
can scarcely be considered poisons. <i>Tungstate</i> of ammonia in the
dose of a drachm had no effect when swallowed by a dog; forty grains
of tungstate of soda, which is more soluble, operated as an emetic; but
this dose will prove fatal to rabbits in a few hours. A drachm of the
muriate of <i>cerium</i> had little or no effect on a dog, and half that dose
had no effect on a rabbit. The oxide of <i>cadmium</i> in the dose of
twenty grains, made a dog vomit; and ten grains had no effect at
all.<a id='r1220' /><a href='#f1220' class='c013'><sup>[1220]</sup></a> Twenty grains of sulphate of <i>nickel</i> made a dog vomit; forty
grains applied to the cellular tissue had no effect at all on the general
constitution; but ten grains injected into the jugular vein occasioned
immediate death [Gmelin]. A drachm of <i>titanic</i> acid had no effect
on a dog.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING WITH LEAD.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>Poisoning with lead is a subject of great consequence in Medical
Police, as well as Medical Jurisprudence. Its preparations have
been used for the purpose of intentional poisoning. At the Taunton
Assizes in March, 1827, a servant-girl was tried for attempting to
administer sugar of lead to her mistress in an arrow-root pudding:
and although the charge was not made out, it appeared from the
prisoner’s confession that she really had made the attempt. Sugar
of lead has also been often taken by accident.</p>

<p class='c006'>In relation to medical police lead is a subject of great importance.
This metal is used in so many forms, and in so many of the arts, and
its effects when gradually introduced into the body are so slow and
insidious, that instances of its deleterious operation are frequently
met with. Such accidents, indeed, are less common now, than they
used to be before the late improvements in chemistry. But they
are still sufficiently frequent to render it necessary for the toxicologist
to investigate the properties of lead attentively.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> I.—<i>Of the Chemical History and Tests for the Preparations of Lead.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The physical characters of lead in its metallic state are familiar to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>every one. It is easily known by the dull bluish-gray colour it
assumes when exposed some time to the air, by the brilliant bluish-gray
colour of a fresh surface, and by the facility with which it may
be cut. The compounds which require particular notice are four in
number, litharge, red lead, white lead, sugar of lead, and Goulard’s
extract. The first three are very much used by house-painters and
glaziers, the last two are extensively employed in surgery, and the
sugar of lead is also used in many of the arts.</p>

<h5 class='c011'>1. <i>Of Litharge and Red Lead.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'><i>Litharge</i> is the protoxide of lead in a state of semivitrification.
<i>Red lead</i> is a compound of two equivalents of protoxide and one
of deutoxide. The former is generally in the form of a grayish-red
heavy powder, sometimes partly crystalline; the latter in the form
of a bright red powder approaching in colour to vermilion. They
may be known by their colour;—by their becoming black when
suspended in water and treated with a stream of sulphuretted-hydrogen
gas;—and by litharge being entirely, and red lead partly,
soluble in nitric acid, and forming a solution which possesses the
properties to be mentioned presently for solutions of the acetate.
The chemical actions concerned in these changes are obvious, except
in the instance of nitric acid on red lead. Here the acid dissolves
the protoxide only, and the deutoxide, which seems to act the part
of an acid in the pigment, is separated in the form of a brown
powder.</p>

<h5 class='c011'>2. <i>Of White Lead.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'><i>White lead</i>, which is the carbonate of the metal, is in the form of
a heavy snow-white powder, or in white chalk-like masses. It consists
of variable proportions of the hydrated oxide and neutral carbonate;
those specimens are the whitest which contain most carbonate;
and the best English white lead I find to contain four equivalents
of carbonate and one of hydrated protoxide. The grayer
variety, formed by the action of distilled water on metallic lead, consists
of only two of the former to one of the latter.<a id='r1221' /><a href='#f1221' class='c013'><sup>[1221]</sup></a> It may be
known by its being blackened like the two former compounds by
sulphuretted-hydrogen,—by being soluble with effervescence in nitric
acid,—and by becoming permanently yellow when heated to redness,
in consequence of the expulsion of its carbonic acid, and its
conversion into protoxide. These tests, however, apply with exactness
only to the pure carbonate, in which state white lead is not
often met with in the shops. It is generally adulterated with sulphates,
in consequence of which it is only partially acted on by nitric
acid, and does not become distinctly yellow under a strong red heat.
Dutch white-lead contains no less than between 78·5 and 25 per cent.
of impurities insoluble in nitric acid, Venetian white-lead from 11 to
14·5 per cent., Munich white-lead between 1 and 7·5 per cent.<a id='r1222' /><a href='#f1222' class='c013'><sup>[1222]</sup></a> I have
met, however, with perfectly pure specimens in the shops of this city.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>
  <h5 class='c011'>3. <i>Of Sugar of Lead.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c012'><i>Sugar of lead</i> is the acetate of this metal. It is sold in the form
either of a white heavy powder, or of aggregated masses of long
four-sided prismatic crystals. It has a sweetish astringent taste, and
a slight acetous odour. It is very soluble.</p>

<p class='c006'>When in the solid state, it may be known by its solubility in
water, and by the effects of heat. It first undergoes the aqueous
fusion, then abandons a part of its acid empyreumatized, as may
be perceived by the smell, next becomes charred, and finally presents
globules of lead reduced by the charcoal of the acid. The best way
of effecting its reduction on the small scale is to char it, and then
direct on the mass the point of a blowpipe-flame: in an instant
globules are developed. It is not easily reduced in a tube; at least
I have never been able to succeed in that way.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the fluid state the acetate of lead, as well as all its soluble salts,
may be detected by the following system of reagents,—hydrosulphuric
acid, bichromate of potass, hydriodate of potass, and metallic
zinc,—which are the best of the numerous reagents yet proposed.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <i>Hydrosulphuric acid</i> causes a black precipitate, the sulphuret of
lead. This is a test of extreme delicacy; and it acts in whatever
state of combination the lead exists, whether fluid or solid.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is preferable to the hydrosulphate of ammonia as a medico-legal
test; for, as Fourcroy observed, the hydrosulphate of ammonia acts
on many sound wines as if they contained lead,<a id='r1223' /><a href='#f1223' class='c013'><sup>[1223]</sup></a> while hydrosulphuric
acid never causes with them a black precipitate, unless they
contain either lead or some other metallic impregnation. It must
be remembered that many other metallic solutions, such as those of
mercury, copper, silver and bismuth, yield a black precipitate with
this test.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. <i>Chromate of potass</i>, both in the state of proto-chromate and
bichromate, causes a fine gamboge-yellow precipitate, the chromate
of lead. For the characteristic action of this reagent, it is desirable
that the suspected liquid be neutral. It forms with solutions of the
sulphate of copper a precipitate nearly of the same colour as the
chromate of lead.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. <i>Hydriodate of potass</i> causes also a lively gamboge-yellow precipitate,
the iodide of lead. The action of this test is impaired in
delicacy by a considerable excess of nitric acid, or acetic acid.
These acids cause a yellow coloration with the test, though no lead
be present.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. <i>A rod of zinc</i> held for some time in the solution displaces the
lead, taking its place, and throwing down the lead in the form of a
crystalline arborescence. This is a very characteristic test; and also
one of much delicacy; for I have found a small thread of zinc will
very easily detect a twentieth part of a grain of lead dissolved in
the form of acetate in 20,000 parts of water. It acts also on the
nitrate of lead. Its action is impaired or prevented by an excess of
acetic or nitric acid.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>These tests are amply sufficient for determining the presence of
lead in a solution, provided they act characteristically. Others have
been also used, however; and it is therefore right to notice them
cursorily.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>alkaline carbonates</i> throw down a white precipitate in a very
diluted solution of lead. This test is ineligible, because the alkaline
carbonates cause a white precipitate with many other salts. It
might be rendered decisive, however, by washing the precipitate
thoroughly, suspending it in pure water and transmitting sulphuretted-hydrogen,
which blackens it. No other white carbonate is
similarly altered except those of bismuth and silver, which are rare.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>soluble sulphates</i> likewise cause with solutions of lead a white
precipitate, the sulphate of lead. To this test the same objections
apply as to the carbonates of the alkalis.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>ferro-cyanate of potash</i> causes a white precipitate, the ferro-cyanate
of lead. This is an objectionable test, as many other substances
besides lead are similarly acted on by it.</p>

<h5 class='c011'>4. <i>Goulard’s Extract.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>Goulard’s extract, the diacetate of lead, is easily distinguished
from the acetate or sugar of lead by the effect of a stream of carbonic
acid, which throws down a copious precipitate of carbonate of lead.
The proper method of analyzing it is to transmit this gas till it ceases
to act any longer, and then to subject the precipitate and solution to
the tests for carbonate of lead, and acetate of lead. Solutions of the
common acetate usually give a scanty white precipitate with carbonic
acid, in consequence of containing a faint excess of oxide.</p>

<p class='c006'>The presence of vegetable or animal matters may either decompose
the salts of lead, or materially alter the action of the preceding
reagents.</p>

<p class='c006'>It appears from the experiments of Orfila, that most vegetable
infusions possess the power of decomposing them more or less.
The acetate furnishes, for example, an abundant precipitate with
infusion of galls, or with infusion of tea. Almost all animal fluids,
with the exception of gelatin, possess the same property; albumen,
milk, bile, beef-tea, all give with it a copious precipitate. In fluids
which do not decompose it altogether, the colour of the precipitate
formed by the tests is so materially altered, that they cannot be relied
on for the detection of lead. The test, however, which undergoes
least alteration is hydrosulphuric acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before proceeding to the detection of lead in complex organic
mixtures, some remarks will be required on its relations to medical
police. Here the various ways in which it is apt to be insidiously
introduced into the body, chiefly by the action of chemical agents on
metallic lead itself, will come under consideration.</p>

<h5 class='c011'><i>Of the Action of Air and Pure Water on Lead.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>When lead is exposed to the air it becomes tarnished. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>arises from a thin crust of carbonate of lead being formed; for the
crust dissolves with brisk effervescence in acetic acid. The formation
of carbonate is accelerated by moisture and probably by the
presence of an unusual proportion of carbonic acid in the air.</p>

<p class='c006'>The action of water on lead, which is of much greater consequence,
has been made the subject of observation by the curious for
many ages. The Roman architect, Vitruvius, who, it is believed,
nourished in the time of Cæsar and Augustus, forbids the use of this
metal for conducting water, because cerusse, he says, is formed on it,
which is hurtful to the human body.<a id='r1224' /><a href='#f1224' class='c013'><sup>[1224]</sup></a> Galen also condemns the use
of lead pipes, because he was aware, that water transmitted through
them contracted a muddiness from the lead, and those who drank
such water were subject to dysentery.<a id='r1225' /><a href='#f1225' class='c013'><sup>[1225]</sup></a> If we trace the sciences of
architecture, chemistry, and medicine downwards from these periods,
nothing more will be found than a repetition of the statements of Vitruvius
and Galen, with but a few particular facts in support of them,
till we arrive at the close of the last and beginning of the present
century.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first person that examined the subject minutely, was Dr.
Lambe of Warwick; who inferred from his researches, that most, if
not all, spring waters possess the power of corroding and dissolving
lead to such an extent as to be rendered unfit for the use of man,
and that this solvent power is imparted to them by some of their
saline ingredients.<a id='r1226' /><a href='#f1226' class='c013'><sup>[1226]</sup></a> The inquiry was afterwards undertaken more
scientifically by Guyton-Morveau; who, in opposition to Dr. Lambe,
arrived at the conclusion, that distilled water, the purest of all
waters, acts rapidly on lead by converting it into a hydrated oxide,
and that some natural waters, which hardly attack lead at all, are prevented
doing so by the salts they hold in solution.<a id='r1227' /><a href='#f1227' class='c013'><sup>[1227]</sup></a> A few years
later Dr. Thomson of Glasgow also examined the subject, and, assenting
to Dr. Lambe’s proposition, that most spring waters attack
lead, maintains nevertheless that the lead is only held in suspension,
not in solution; and that the quantity suspended in such waters, after
they have passed through lead pipes, pumps, and cisterns, is too
minute to prove injurious to those who make habitual use of them.<a id='r1228' /><a href='#f1228' class='c013'><sup>[1228]</sup></a>
In the first edition of this work an extended account was given of
an investigation I made into the whole subject of the action of different
waters on lead.<a id='r1229' /><a href='#f1229' class='c013'><sup>[1229]</sup></a> Additional observations were afterwards
published on the same point by Captain Yorke,<a id='r1230' /><a href='#f1230' class='c013'><sup>[1230]</sup></a> and by Mr. Taylor.<a id='r1231' /><a href='#f1231' class='c013'><sup>[1231]</sup></a>
And I have added some new facts in a late paper.<a id='r1232' /><a href='#f1232' class='c013'><sup>[1232]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>The inquiry is of so great practical consequence, that I need not
offer any apology for reproducing it here in detail, with such additions
as ulterior experience and the researches of others enable me
to make. Professor Orfila takes no notice of this important subject,
except in a few lines containing several inaccurate statements.<a id='r1233' /><a href='#f1233' class='c013'><sup>[1233]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Distilled water, deprived of its gases by ebullition, and excluded
from contact with the air, has no action whatever on lead. If the
water contains the customary gases in solution, the surface of the
metal, freshly polished, becomes quickly dull and white. But if the
surface of the water be not at the same time exposed to the air, the
action soon comes to a close.—When the air, on the other hand, is
allowed free access to the water, a white powder appears in a few
minutes on and around the lead; and this goes on increasing till in
the course of a few days there is formed a large quantity of white
matter which partly floats in the water or adheres to the lead, but is
chiefly deposited on the bottom of the vessel. If this experiment be
made with atmospheric air deprived of carbonic acid, the white substance
puts on the form of a fine powder, which I find to be a hydrated
oxide; for when dried at 180°F. it gives off water on being
heated to redness, and dissolves without effervescence in weak nitric
acid.—But if the surface of the water be exposed to the open air,
the substance formed consists of minute brilliant pearly scales, which
with the aid of a powerful microscope are seen to be thin equilateral
triangular tables, often grouped into hexaedral tables, or worn at the
edges into the form of rosettes. This substance, which has a pale
grayish hue when dried, I have ascertained to be a carbonate of lead,
consisting of two equivalents of neutral carbonate and one of hydrated
protoxide.<a id='r1234' /><a href='#f1234' class='c013'><sup>[1234]</sup></a> The formation of carbonate takes place with considerable
rapidity. In twelve ounces of distilled water, contained in a
shallow glass basin loosely covered to exclude the dust, twelve
brightly polished lead rods weighing 340 grains, will lose two grains
and a half in eight days; and the lead will then show evident marks
of corrosion. The process of corrosion goes on so long as atmospheric
air is allowed to play freely on the surface of the water. In
twenty months I have obtained 120 grains from an ounce of lead rods
kept in 24 ounces of distilled water.</p>

<p class='c006'>During these changes, a minute quantity of lead is dissolved. This
is best proved by carefully filtering the water, then acidulating with
a drop or two of nitric acid, and evaporating to dryness. I have
never failed to detect lead in the residue by expelling the excess of
nitric acid by heat, dissolving it in distilled water, and applying hydrosulphuric
acid, hydriodate of potass, and chromate of potass to the
solution. The lead is first dissolved in the form of hydrated oxide.
For, if the air admitted to the water be deprived of carbonic acid, a
clear liquid is obtained by filtration, and this is turned brown by hydrosulphuric
acid. But a great part of the hydrate is speedily separated
in the form of carbonate. For the filtered liquid speedily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>becomes turbid if exposed to the air; and on evaporating it, the
residuum dissolves in weak nitric acid with brisk effervescence.
Captain Yorke estimates the quantity dissolved when the water is
saturated at a 10,000th part.<a id='r1235' /><a href='#f1235' class='c013'><sup>[1235]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>By far the greatest part of the lead, however, which disappears,
will be found in the white pearly crystals. This crystalline powder
is not,—as alleged by Guyton-Morveau, and after him by some
systematic writers, a hydrated oxide of lead, but, as stated above, a
particular variety of carbonate, containing more hydrated oxide than
exists in common white lead. At first I thought it was neutral carbonate.
Captain Yorke was led to suppose it hydrated oxide. In
1842 I found that, if it be exposed for some time to the action of
aërated water after the lead has been removed, it invariably consists
of two equivalents of neutral carbonate and one of hydrated oxide.</p>

<p class='c006'>It will be inferred from the preceding facts, that distilled water
for economical use should never be preserved in leaden vessels or
otherwise in contact with lead. Even the distilled water of aromatic
plants should not be so preserved, because the essential oil which communicates
to them their fragrance does not take away the power
which pure distilled water possesses of acting on lead. This fact
was first announced in the second edition of the present work. A
druggist in Edinburgh requested me to examine a reddish-gray crystalline,
pearly sediment formed copiously in a sample of orange-flower
water. I found this to be carbonate of lead coloured by the colouring
matter of the water, and obviously produced by the action of the
water on lead solder used instead of tin solder, and coarsely and
liberally applied to the seams of the copper vessel in which the water
had been imported from France. The filtered fluid did not contain a
particle of lead. The same observation has been since made by a
French pharmaceutic chemist, M. Barateau, who seems at a loss,
however, to account for the formation of the carbonate of lead.<a id='r1236' /><a href='#f1236' class='c013'><sup>[1236]</sup></a> It
appears from an inquiry of MM. Labarraque and Pelletier, conducted
at the request of the Prefecture of Paris, that the orange-flower water,
which is extensively used there, is often adulterated with lead in
solution. They impute this to careless distillation; for then some of
the decoction is driven over with the distilled liquid, and consequently
produces a fluid which becomes acetous by keeping and dissolves
the lead solder of the <i>estagnons</i> or copper vessels. Pure
orange-flower water does not acidify by keeping.<a id='r1237' /><a href='#f1237' class='c013'><sup>[1237]</sup></a> M. Chevallier in
a more recent investigation arrived at the same results, and found
that few specimens of the orange-flower water of Paris were altogether
free of lead.<a id='r1238' /><a href='#f1238' class='c013'><sup>[1238]</sup></a> In none of these inquiries have the authors adverted
to the action of pure water in forming carbonate of lead.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>
  <h5 class='c011'><i>Of the Action of Solutions of Neutral Salts on Lead.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The property which pure aërated water possesses of corroding lead
is variously affected by foreign ingredients which it may hold in solution.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of these modifying substances none are more remarkable in their
action than the neutral salts, which all impair the corrosive power of
the water. Important practical consequences flow from that action;
for it involves no less than the possibility of employing lead for most
of the economical purposes to which the ingenuity of man has applied
that useful metal. The first experimentalist who made it an
object of attention was Guyton-Morveau; whose experiments are
imperfect and in some respects erroneous. Having found that distilled
water corrodes lead, he proceeded to inquire why no change of
the kind takes place in some natural waters; and being aware that
most spring and river waters differ from that which has been distilled,
chiefly in containing sulphate of lime and muriate of soda, he tried a
solution of each of these salts, and discovered that the addition of a
certain quantity of either to distilled water takes away from it the
power of attacking lead,—that this preservative power is possessed
by so small a proportion as a 500th part of sulphate of lime in the water,—and
that the nitrates are also probably endowed with the same
singular property.<a id='r1239' /><a href='#f1239' class='c013'><sup>[1239]</sup></a> Here his researches terminated.</p>

<p class='c006'>Extending Guyton-Morveau’s inquiries to other proportions of
the same salts, and likewise to many other neutral salts, I was led to
the conclusion, that all of them without exception possess the
power of impairing the action of distilled water on lead. At least I
found this power to exist in the case of sulphates, muriates, carbonates,
hydriodates, phosphates, nitrates, acetates, tartrates, and arseniates.</p>

<p class='c006'>The degree of this preservative power differs much in different salts.
The acetate of soda is but an imperfect preventive when dissolved
in the proportion of a hundredth part of the water: white crystals are
formed, and the lead loses about a fourth of what is lost in distilled
water in the same time. On the contrary, arseniate of soda is a complete
preservative when dissolved in the proportion of a 12,000th;
and phosphate of soda and hydriodate of potass are almost effectual
preservatives in the proportion of a 30,000th part only of the water.<a id='r1240' /><a href='#f1240' class='c013'><sup>[1240]</sup></a>
Muriate of soda and sulphate of lime hold a middle place between
these extremes, and are both of them much more powerful than Guyton-Morveau
imagined: the former preserves in the proportion of a
2000th to the water, the latter in the proportion of nearly a 4000th.
Nitrate of potass is little superior to the acetate of soda: in the proportion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>of a hundredth it prevents the action of the water almost entirely;
but if the proportion be diminished to a 160th, the loss sustained
by the lead is fully a third of the loss in distilled water.</p>

<p class='c006'>When lead has been exposed for a few weeks to a solution of a
protecting salt and has acquired a thin film over its surface, it not
only is not acted on by the solution, but is even also rendered incapable
of being acted on by distilled water.</p>

<p class='c006'>The preservative power depends on the acid, not on the base of
the salt. The acetate, muriate, arseniate, and phosphate of soda
differ exceedingly in power. On the other hand, the sulphates of
soda, magnesia, and lime, as well as the triple sulphate of alumina
and potass, preserve as nearly as can be determined in the same proportion.</p>

<p class='c006'>When we attempt to ascertain the relative preserving power of the
neutral salts, it will appear that those whose acid forms with the lead
a soluble salt of lead are the least energetic; while those whose acid
forms an insoluble salt of lead are most energetic. The protecting
powers of acetate of soda, nitrate of potass, muriate of soda, sulphate
of lime, arseniate of soda, and phosphate of soda, are inversely as
the solubility of the acetate, nitrate, muriate, sulphate, arseniate, and
phosphate of lead. The existence of this ratio might naturally lead
to the inference that the protecting power depends simply on the salt
in solution being decomposed, so that there is formed on the surface
of the lead a thin crust consisting of the oxide of the metal in union
with the acid of the decomposed salt, and constituting an insoluble
film which is impermeable to aërated water: for example, that phosphate
of soda acts in the small proportion of a 30,000th part by forming
on the surface of the metal an impermeable film of phosphate of
lead, which is known to be one of the most insoluble of all the neutral
salts. But this is not altogether a correct statement of the fact.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the protection afforded is complete, as for example by a
27,000th of phosphate of soda, a 12,000th of arseniate of soda, or a
4000th of sulphate of soda, the lead undergoes no change in appearance
or in weight for several hours, or even days. At length the
surface becomes dull, then white, and gradually a uniform film is
formed over it. This film, examined at an early period, is found to
consist of carbonate of lead,—being entirely soluble in diluted
acetic acid, although the salts in solution is a sulphate or phosphate.
But after a few weeks the carbonate is mixed with a salt of lead, containing
the acid of a part of the neutral salt dissolved in the water:
if, after five or six weeks’ immersion in a preservative solution of
phosphate or sulphate of soda, the film on the lead be scraped off
and immersed in diluted acetic acid, effervescence and solution take
place, but a part of the powder remains undissolved; and if the protecting
salt has been the muriate of soda, the whole powder is dissolved,
but muriatic acid will be found in solution by its proper test,
the nitrate of silver.—In all such protecting solutions the lead gains
weight for some weeks; but at length it ceases to undergo farther
change, and is not acted on even if removed into distilled water.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>The crust, when formed thus slowly, adheres with great firmness.
The most careful analysis cannot detect any lead, either dissolved in
the water, or floating in it, or united with the insoluble matter left on
the side of the glass by evaporation. In short, the preservation of
the lead from corrosion, and of the water from impregnation with
lead, is complete.<a id='r1241' /><a href='#f1241' class='c013'><sup>[1241]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>When the protection afforded is not quite complete,—for example
in distilled water containing a 4000th of muriate of soda, a
6000th of sulphate of soda, a 15,000th of arseniate of soda, or a
35,000th of phosphate of soda,—besides a powdery crust, small
crystals, with several facettes, are sometimes formed on the lead,
while, at the same time, a minute white film will very slowly appear
on the bottom of the glass, on its side where it is left dry by the
evaporation of the water, and likewise on the surface of the water
itself. These detached films are composed of carbonate of lead,
with a little of the muriate, sulphate, arseniate, or phosphate of lead,
according to the nature of the acid in the alkaline salt which is
dissolved in the water. In the course of the changes now described,
the lead in general no longer gains, but loses weight.
The loss, however, is exceedingly small.—No lead can be discovered
in solution, if the water before evaporation is carefully
filtered.</p>

<p class='c006'>On progressively trying solutions of weaker and weaker preservative
power, it will be remarked, that the quantity of the detached
powder, and the proportion of carbonate in it, progressively increase;
and likewise, that what is formed on the lead adheres more and
more loosely. In distilled water and weak solutions of acetate of
soda, or nitrate of potass, the lead never becomes so firmly encrusted,
but that gentle agitation of the water will shake off the powder.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is worthy of notice that, although a small quantity of lead is
dissolved by distilled water after it has remained some time in contact
with the metal, yet not a trace is found in solution where a protecting
salt is present. In solutions even weakly preservative I never
could detect any lead dissolved. Thus, in distilled water containing
a 4000th of muriate of soda, or a 160th of nitre, the lead lost
weight, and loose crystals of carbonate were formed; yet even after
thirty days no lead could be found in solution by the process with which I
have always detected it in pure distilled water. Free exposure to
the air is probably in part the cause of this. For it will be seen afterwards
that some natural waters in passing through a long course
of lead pipes, within which the action goes on without direct access
of the atmosphere, contract an impregnation, which is invisible when
the water is newly drawn, but after a few hours’ exposure to the air
shows itself in the form of a white film and milkiness.</p>

<p class='c006'>The general result of these experiments appears to be, that neutral
salts in various, and for the most part minute, proportions, retard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>or prevent the corrosive action of water on lead,—allowing the
carbonate to deposit itself slowly, and to adhere with such firmness
to the lead as not to be afterwards removable by moderate agitation,
adding subsequently to this crust other insoluble salts of lead, the
acids of which are derived from the neutral salts in solution,—and
thus at length forming a permanent impermeable skreen, through
which the action of the water cannot any longer be carried on.</p>

<p class='c006'>An important subject of inquiry regards the natural causes by
which the preservative power of the neutral salts is impaired. This
topic I have not hitherto been able to examine with all the care
which is desirable.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the effect of the water of Edinburgh when highly charged
with carbonic acid, I was led to infer in former editions of this work
that an unusual quantity of carbonic acid is a counteracting agent.
For if Edinburgh water charged with it be corked up with some lead
rods in a phial half-filled with water, and half with atmospheric air, the
lead, which in common Edinburgh water, as will presently be mentioned,
hardly loses any of its brilliancy for six or seven days, becomes
quite white in twelve or sixteen hours. Subsequent experiments by
Captain Yorke seemed to him to render this conclusion doubtful;
nor do I attach much consequence to the observation just quoted.
On the other hand it is said Professor Daniell has found all waters
dissolve lead, if they contain an excess of carbonic acid.<a id='r1242' /><a href='#f1242' class='c013'><sup>[1242]</sup></a> The
point would be best settled by the effect of a natural carbonated
water passing through a long lead pipe.</p>

<h5 class='c011'><i>On the Action of Natural Waters on Lead.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>The preceding observations on the action of water on lead may
be resorted to for explaining many interesting facts, and correcting
some erroneous statements, which have been published by authors as
to the corrosion of lead by natural processes.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Rain and Snow-Water.</i>—It has been stated by Dr. Lambe that
rain-water does not corrode lead, that “its effect is so slight as not
to be discernible within a moderate compass of time.”<a id='r1243' /><a href='#f1243' class='c013'><sup>[1243]</sup></a> But this
observation is far from being correct. Rain or snow-water, collected
in the country at a distance from houses, and before it touches the
earth, being nearly as pure as distilled water, ought to act with equal
rapidity on lead. I have accordingly found by a comparative experiment
with that mentioned in p. <a href='#Page_401'>401</a>, that in twelve ounces of snow-water,
collected ten miles west from Edinburgh, and at some distance
from any house, twelve lead rods weighing 340 grains lost two
grains in eight days, and the usual crystals began to form in less than
an hour. But when collected in a great city, rain or snow-water is
much impaired in activity. Thus in an experiment made with eaves’-droppings
collected from the roof of my house in Edinburgh, after
half an hour of gentle rain from the south-east,—the first rain which
had fallen for several weeks,—there was no action at all. Yet even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>when collected in a great city, and in circumstances which at first
sight would appear not very favourable to its action,—for example
from eaves’-droppings a few hours after the beginning of a shower,—it
retains a little of its corroding property; and when collected in
like manner after twelve or twenty-four hours’ rain, it corrodes almost
as rapidly as distilled water. Thus with four ounces of eaves’-droppings
collected after the shower last alluded to had continued four
hours, the crystalline powder began to cover the bottom of the glass
in five hours, and in nine days three lead rods weighing fifty-seven
grains lost a fifth of a grain. And in another experiment made with
eaves’-droppings after a day’s steady rain from the north-east, the
powder began to form in half an hour, and the loss sustained by the
lead in thirty-three days was a grain and a third, being very nearly
what is lost in distilled water during the same time.</p>

<p class='c006'>We must obviously be prepared to look for an explanation of these
differences in the relative purity of the different waters. Accordingly,
in the eaves’-droppings at the beginning of the shower the nitrates
of baryta and silver caused, the former a distinct, the latter a faint
precipitation, which, as oxalate of ammonia had no effect, arose from
the presence of alkaline sulphates and muriates: but after a four
hours’ shower nitrate of baryta alone acted, and caused merely a
faint haze: and after a twenty-four hours’ shower, as well as in
snow-water from the country, none of the three tests had any effect
whatever.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hence, perhaps even in a town, but at all events certainly in the
country, it would be wrong to use for culinary purposes rain or snow-water
which has run from lead roofs or spouts recently erected.
When the roof or spout has been exposed for some time to the
weather the danger is of course much lessened, if not entirely removed;
because exposure to the weather encrusts it with a firmly
adhering coat of carbonate, through which, as already observed,
even distilled water will not act. But I believe it would be right to
condemn the turning even old leaden roofs to the purpose of collecting
water for the kitchen. Although the purest rain-water cannot
act on them when it is once fairly at repose, we do not know what
may be the effect of the impetus of the falling rain on the crust of
carbonate; and if the crust should happen to be thus worn considerably,
or detached by more obvious accidents, the corrosion
would then go on with rapidity as long as the shower lasted. Acid
emanations too disengaged in the neighbourhood, and other more
obscure causes may enable rain-water actually to dissolve even the
crust of carbonate.</p>

<p class='c006'>These remarks on the effect of rain-water on lead are pointedly
illustrated by what Tronchin has recorded of the circumstances connected
with the spreading of the lead colic at Amsterdam, about the
time he wrote his valuable essay on that disease. Till that period
lead colic was seldom met with in the Dutch capital. But soon after
the citizens began to substitute lead for tiles on the roofs of their
dwelling-houses, the disease broke out with violence and committed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>great ravages. Tronchin very properly ascribed its increase to lead
entering the body insidiously along with the water, which for culinary
purposes was chiefly collected from the roofs during rain. He
farther attempts to account for the rain-water having acquired the
power of corroding the lead, by supposing that it was rendered acid
in consequence of the roofs having been covered with decaying
leaves from trees which abounded in the city; and without a doubt
this explanation accords with the season at which the lead colic was
observed to be most frequent,—namely, the autumn. But he does
not seem to have been aware that rain-water itself possesses the corroding
property, independently of any extrinsic ingredient except the
gases it receives in its passage through the atmosphere.<a id='r1244' /><a href='#f1244' class='c013'><sup>[1244]</sup></a>—Mérat has
referred to a Dutch author, Wanstroostwyk, for an account of a
similar incident which happened at Haarlem.<a id='r1245' /><a href='#f1245' class='c013'><sup>[1245]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The co-operating effect of acid emanations in the atmosphere is
well exemplified by an interesting incident which occurred this year
in Manchester, as detailed in some documents put into my hands by
Dr. Hibbert Ware. A gentleman being seized with symptoms, which
in the opinion of his medical adviser were owing to the insidious
introduction of lead into the body, it was found by Mr. Davies that
the rain-water from a leaden roof, which had been used in the family
for nine years, contained a considerable impregnation of lead. At
first this excited some surprise, because the roof was an old one. But
on farther inquiry it was found, that the rain in descending contracted
an impregnation of hydrochloric acid from the vapours which escaped
from an adjoining manufactory. A portion of the water which was
sent to me contained so much lead dissolved that it became dark-brown
on the addition of hydrosulphuric acid, and a considerable
black precipitate was slowly deposited.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Spring Water.</i>—Most spring waters, unlike rain or snow-water,
have little or no action on lead, because they generally contain a considerable
proportion of muriates and sulphates.</p>

<p class='c006'>As an example of a spring water which does not act on lead at all,
the mineral water of Airthrey, near Stirling, may be mentioned. In
four ounces of water from the strongest spring at Airthrey, I kept for
thirty-five days three bright rods of lead weighing 47·007 grains; and
at the end of that period the rods were very nearly as brilliant as
when they were first put in, and weighed 47·004 grains. This result
is easily explained on considering the nature of the water. It contains
no less than a seventy-seventh part of its weight of saline matters,
which are chiefly muriates, and partly sulphates.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another good illustration occurred to me lately, which contrasts
well with some instances of an opposite description to be mentioned
presently. The house of Phantassie in East-Lothian was supplied
with water by a lead pipe from a distance of a mile. About a year
afterwards, when I had an opportunity of examining into the circumstances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>I found the cistern singularly clean and free of incrustation,
and the water quite free of lead. The composition of the water explained
these facts. It contains a 4,900th of salts, a large proportion
of which consists of carbonates of lime and magnesia.</p>

<p class='c006'>The water of Edinburgh is another example of spring water nearly
destitute of action on lead. But it is not so completely inactive as
the water of Airthrey. In four ounces of water three bright rods
weighing fifty-seven grains lost in seven days a 250th of a grain, in
twenty-one days a 100th, in thirty-five days a 66th, and in sixty-three
days a 59th of a grain. In seven days the lead was hardly
tarnished at all, and not a speck of powder could be seen in the
water, or on the glass. In twenty-one days, but still more in thirty-five
or sixty-three days, the lead was uniformly dull; and on the surface
of the water, as well as on the bottom of the glass, and on the
side where left dry by the evaporation of the water, there were many
white, filmy specks, which became black with the hydrosulphate of
ammonia. In another experiment 145 grains of lead kept for six
months in six ounces of Edinburgh water, which was filled up as it
evaporated, lost a fifteenth of a grain; and the white incrustation on
the bottom and sides of the glass gave a large proportion of black
precipitate when scraped together and treated with hydrosulphate of
ammonia. These experiments are of some practical importance. For
they show that the impregnation which the water of Edinburgh can
receive in a few days from being kept in lead is so small as to be
barely perceptible by the nicest analysis; but that the impregnation
may be material if the same portion of water is kept in lead for a considerable
length of time. Hence the perfect safety of the leaden cisterns
and service-pipes used in this city. The same portion of water
rarely remains in them above a single day, and therefore cannot become
impregnated in a degree that is appreciable by the nicest examination.
Dr. Thomson of Glasgow, in an interesting inquiry made
in 1815 into the purity of the water which supplies Tunbridge, has
stated that, when he lived in Edinburgh some years before, he could
always detect a minute trace of lead suspended in the water, which
at that time was brought six miles in leaden pipes.<a id='r1246' /><a href='#f1246' class='c013'><sup>[1246]</sup></a> I presume it is
owing to the main pipes being now made of iron that this impregnation
no longer exists. For I have found that the residue of two gallons
of water, very carefully collected by gentle evaporation of successive
portions in a small vessel, did not furnish the slightest trace
of lead, when strongly heated with black flux and then acted on by
nitric acid.<a id='r1247' /><a href='#f1247' class='c013'><sup>[1247]</sup></a> The feeble action of the Edinburgh water on lead arises
from the salts it holds in solution. It contains about a 12,000th part
of its weight of solid matter, of which about two-thirds are carbonate
of lime, and one-third consists of the sulphates and muriates of soda,
lime, and magnesia.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>Many instances might be quoted of spring waters which act with
inconvenient or dangerous rapidity on lead. But it is hardly worth
while mentioning more than one or two of these, because the nature
of the waters has been seldom described.</p>

<p class='c006'>A striking example was related by Dr. Wall of Worcester. A
family in that town, consisting of the parents and twenty-one children,
were constantly liable to stomach and bowel complaints; and
eight of the children and both parents died in consequence. Their
house being sold after their death, the purchaser found it necessary
to repair the pump; because the cylinder and cistern were riddled
with holes and as thin as a sieve. The plumber who renewed it informed
Dr. Wall that he had repaired it several times before, and in
particular had done so not four years before the former occupant
died.<a id='r1248' /><a href='#f1248' class='c013'><sup>[1248]</sup></a> The nature of the water was not determined. Most of the
water around Worcester is very hard; but this will not account for
its operation in the instance now described.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another incident of the same kind, but hardly so unequivocal in
its circumstances, was related in 1823 by Dr. Yeats of Tunbridge.
A plumber undertook to supply that town with water for domestic
purposes, and in 1814 laid a course of leaden pipes for a quarter of
a mile. In the subsequent year many cases of lead colic occurred
among the inhabitants who were supplied by those pipes; and one
lady particularly, who was a great water-drinker, lost the use of her
limbs for some months. The inhabitants naturally became alarmed;
iron pipes were substituted; and no case of colic appeared afterwards.
Mr. Brande analyzed the water which had passed through
the pipes and detected lead in it, while at the same time none could
be detected at the source.<a id='r1249' /><a href='#f1249' class='c013'><sup>[1249]</sup></a> Some uncertainty was supposed to have
been thrown over these statements by the analytic researches of Drs.
Thomson, Scudamore, and Prout, and Mr. Children.<a id='r1250' /><a href='#f1250' class='c013'><sup>[1250]</sup></a> But water
like that in question can scarce fail to act powerfully on lead in
favourable circumstances; for according to the analysis of Dr.
Thomson it is extremely pure, as it contains only a 38,000th part of
saline matter, three-fourths of which are a feebly protecting salt, the
muriate of soda.<a id='r1251' /><a href='#f1251' class='c013'><sup>[1251]</sup></a> I am satisfied, therefore, from my experiments,
and the facts which follow, that no such water could be safely conveyed
through new lead pipes; and that it would be dangerous even
to keep it long in a lead cistern. It is difficult to account for the
failure of the gentlemen above mentioned to find lead in the water,
except by supposing that they had analyzed what had been exposed
for some time to the air, and deposited its oxide of lead in the form
of carbonate.</p>

<p class='c006'>Since my attention was first turned to this subject, the three following
incidents have occurred to me, which show the danger of
conveying very pure water in long lead pipes. 1. A gentleman in
Dumfries-shire resolved to bring to his house in leaden pipes the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>water of a fine spring on his estate, from a distance of three-quarters
of a mile. As I happened to visit him at the time, I took the opportunity
of examining the action of a tumbler of the water on fresh
cut lead, and could not remark any perceptible effect in fourteen
days. It appeared to me, therefore, that the water might be safely
conveyed in lead pipes; and they were laid accordingly. No sooner,
however, did the water come into use in the family, than it was observed
to present a general white haze, and the glass decanters in
daily use acquired a manifest white, pearly incrustation. On examining
the cistern, the surface of the water, as well as that of the
cistern itself, where in contact with it, was found completely white,
as if coated with paint; and the water taken directly from the pipe,
though transparent at first, became hazy and white when heated or
left some hours exposed to the air. On afterwards analyzing the
water direct from the spring, I found it of very unusual purity; as it
contained scarcely a 22,000th of solid ingredients, which were sulphates,
muriates, and carbonates. The reader can be at no loss to
perceive why the experiment with a few sticks of lead in a tumbler
was not a correct representation of what was subsequently to go on
in the pipes: in fact, as the pipes were 4000 feet long, and three-fourths
of an inch in diameter, each portion of water may be considered
as passing successively over no less than 784 square feet of
lead before being discharged. The remedy employed in this case
will be mentioned presently [p. <a href='#Page_415'>415</a>]. 2. A gentleman in Banffshire
introduced a fine spring into his house from a distance of three-quarters
of a mile by means of a lead pipe. Two years and a half
afterwards he was attacked with stomach complaints, obstinate constipation,
and severe colic, for which he was under medical treatment
for three months, with only partial and temporary relief. At last
on leaving home and repairing to Edinburgh, he soon got quite well.
Two other members of his family were similarly, but more slightly
affected. On returning home some time afterwards, the same symptoms
began to show themselves; but he had not been many weeks
there, when his attention was accidentally drawn to a notice of my
experiments, and of the last case, in Chambers’s Journal. He then
saw that a white film lined the inside of the water-bottle in his dressing-room;
and the water was declared by a chemist to contain lead.
I lately had an opportunity of analyzing the water, and found it
to contain only a 16,500th of solid matter, the principal salt being
chloride of sodium, and the others being sulphates of magnesia and
lime, with very little carbonate. This, therefore, was exactly a case
in which action upon lead might have been anticipated, as the principal
proportion of the very small quantity of saline matter present
was a feebly protective salt. 3. The third instance occurred at a
country residence of Lord Aberdeen. Mr. Johnston, surgeon at
Peterhead, being called to visit the housekeeper, found her affected
with vomiting, constipation, acute pain at the pit of the stomach, retraction
of the navel, and great feebleness. Little improvement
was effected in three days, when Mr. Johnston, astonished at this,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>and reflecting on the cause, suddenly was attracted by the appearance
of a silvery film on the inside of his patient’s water-bottle, and recollected
at the same time my narrative of the Dumfries-shire case. He
then perceived that the disease was lead-colic, treated it accordingly,
and slowly accomplished a cure. The housekeeper’s niece, a young
girl who had resided only a few weeks with her, and who was the
only other individual that had lived in the house above a few days
together for more than a year before, had begun also to suffer from
the premonitory symptoms. About twelve months before this incident
happened, a spring of water, which had been analyzed and pronounced
extremely pure, was brought to the house in a lead pipe;
and the housekeeper had used this water for eight months before she
took ill. Mr. Johnston found that the water issued from the pipe was
quite clear, but that a white silvery film formed on its surface under
exposure to the air; and he ascertained that the first-drawn water
contained lead in solution, and that the film was carbonate of lead.
I had an opportunity of analyzing the water, which proved to be by
no means very pure, as it contained a 4460th of solids. But as the
solid matter consisted almost entirely of chlorides, namely, in a great
measure of chloride of sodium and a very little of the chlorides of
magnesium and calcium, as there was no carbonate present, and the
sulphates constituted only a 32,000th of the water,—it is plain from
the principles formerly laid down that the action which took place
was to be anticipated from the nature of the spring.<a id='r1252' /><a href='#f1252' class='c013'><sup>[1252]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>For other instances of the corrosive action of spring water on lead
the reader may refer to Dr. Lambe’s treatise. Dr. Lambe was led
by his researches to imagine that no spring water whatever was destitute
of this property in a dangerous degree. This wide conclusion
is not supported by valid facts. Yet his work contains several accurative
and instructive examples of the action in question. Thus
among other instances he mentions that he had found the water of
Warwick to act on lead with great rapidity, and once saw holes and
furrows in a cistern there, which was the second that had been used
in the course of ten years.<a id='r1253' /><a href='#f1253' class='c013'><sup>[1253]</sup></a> Sir G. Baker, in a letter to Dr. Heberden,
has related another striking instance of the same kind. Lord Ashburnham’s
house in Sussex was supplied from some distance with
water, which was conveyed in leaden pipes. The servants being
often affected with colic, which had even proved fatal to some of
them, the water was carefully examined, and found to contain lead.
The solvent power of the water was ascribed to its containing an
unusual quantity of carbonic acid gas.<a id='r1254' /><a href='#f1254' class='c013'><sup>[1254]</sup></a> This may be doubted.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the course of the preceding remarks, allusion has been made to
the danger of keeping the same portion of water for a length of
time in leaden cisterns, if it has the power of acting on lead even in
a trifling degree. The following illustrations deserve particular
notice.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was mentioned in p. <a href='#Page_409'>409</a>, as the result of experiments on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>small scale, that although the water of Edinburgh does not contract
a sensible impregnation of lead on remaining a few days in contact
with it, yet a sufficient action ensues in the course of a few months,
to show that it might be dangerous to keep that water long in a lead
cistern. After coming to this conclusion, I had an opportunity of
verifying it on a large scale. A cistern in my laboratory in the University
having been left undisturbed for four or five months with
about six inches of water in it, I found so large a quantity of pearly
crystals lying loose on the cistern and diffused through the water, that
when the whole was shaken up and transferred to a glass vessel, the
water appeared quite opaque. Mérat observes that at the laboratory
of the Medical Faculty of Paris there was procured by evaporating
six loads, or probably about 1000 pounds of water, which had been
kept two months in a leaden pneumatic trough, no less than two
ounces of finely crystallized carbonate of lead.<a id='r1255' /><a href='#f1255' class='c013'><sup>[1255]</sup></a> Water in such circumstances
has proved eminently poisonous. Thus, the crew of an
East India packet having been put on short allowance of water, in
consequence of being delayed by contrary winds, the men got their
share each in a bottle; but the officers united their shares and kept
it all in a lead cistern. In three weeks all the officers began to suffer
from stomach and bowel complaints, and had the lead colic for six
weeks; while the men continued to enjoy good health. The surgeon
detected lead in a tumbler of water without the process of concentration,
by adding to it the sulphuret of potass.<a id='r1256' /><a href='#f1256' class='c013'><sup>[1256]</sup></a> A similar accident
has been briefly alluded to by Van Swieten. He mentions, that he
was acquainted with a family who were all attacked with colica
pictonum in consequence of using for culinary purposes water collected
in a large leaden cistern and kept there for a long time.<a id='r1257' /><a href='#f1257' class='c013'><sup>[1257]</sup></a> The
composition of the water has not been mentioned in any of these instances;
but the water of Paris is so strongly impregnated with
calcareous salts, that in ordinary circumstances its action on lead
must be trifling.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was probably from confounding the consequences of keeping the
same water long in a lead cistern with the action in ordinary circumstances,
that Dr. Lambe was led into the error of supposing that all
spring waters whatever act on lead so powerfully, as to render it in
his opinion advisable to abandon the use of this metal in the fabrication
of pipes and cisterns. It must be admitted, however, that in all
likelihood many waters will contain a trace of lead, without being
kept more than the usual time in the pipe or cistern. For Dr. Lambe’s
results correspond to a certain extent with the more recent and accurate
researches of Dr. Thomson, who mentions many instances where
a faint trace of lead was found in the residue of the evaporation of a
large quantity of spring water by himself, as well as by Dr. Dalton,
Dr. Wollaston, and Mr. Children.<a id='r1258' /><a href='#f1258' class='c013'><sup>[1258]</sup></a> But, as Dr. Thomson properly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>adds, when the quantity does not exceed a 600,000th or a millionth
part of the water, as in these instances, it is ridiculous to imagine
that any harm can result to man from the constant use of it for domestic
purposes.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another fact of some practical consequence, which flows from
the experimental conclusions stated above is, that although it
may be perfectly safe to keep some waters in leaden cisterns, it
may be very unsafe to use covers of this metal, because the water
which condenses on the covers must be considered as pure as
distilled water. It has been found that white lead forms in much
larger quantity on the inside of the covers of cisterns than on
the cisterns themselves, where both are constructed of lead. A
remarkable illustration of this is mentioned in a paper read before
the Academy of Sciences at Paris in 1788 by the Comte de
Milly. About a year after getting two leaden cisterns erected
in his house, to keep the water of the Seine for general domestic
purposes, he was attacked with severe and obstinate colic;
which led him to examine his cisterns. He found that the sides,
where they were occasionally left exposed by the subsidence of
the water, and more especially the leaden cover, were lined with
a white liquid, which was constantly dropping from the lid into
the cistern, like the drops in caverns where stalactites are formed.
The water was in consequence so strongly impregnated
with lead as to give a dark precipitate with liver of sulphur.<a id='r1259' /><a href='#f1259' class='c013'><sup>[1259]</sup></a>
The reason of this occurrence is, that the water in the cistern is
a solution of preventive salts, but what reaches the lid is in a
manner distilled. In Edinburgh the lids of the cisterns are invariably
made of wood, whether on account of its superior cheapness
merely, or because a leaden cover had been found perishable,
I have not been able to discover.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be well to conclude these remarks on the action of spring
waters on lead with a general summary of the chief circumstances
to be adverted to in using lead for keeping or conveying water; to
which may be added a few hints for preventing action where it is
found to have taken place.</p>

<p class='c006'>The general results of the preceding inquiries are that rain or
snow-water for culinary use should not be collected from leaden roofs,
nor preserved nor conveyed in lead;—that the same rule applies to
spring waters of unusual purity, where for example the saline impregnation
does not exceed a 15,000th of the water;—that spring water
which contains a 10,000th or 12,000th of salts may be safely conveyed
in lead pipes, if the salts in the water be chiefly carbonates and sulphates;—that
lead pipes cannot be safely used, even where the water
contains a 4000th of saline matter, if this consist chiefly of muriates;—that
spring water, even though it contain a large proportion of
salts, should not be kept for a long period in contact with lead;—and
that cisterns should not be covered with lids of this metal.</p>

<p class='c006'>Where action is observed to take place in the instance of particular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>waters, it may in some cases be impossible to prevent it by any
attainable means. But the inquiries detailed above suggest two modes
by which a remedy may be generally found. It appears that, where
a crust of carbonate is allowed to form slowly and quietly on the
surface of lead, even distilled water ceases to have any material action;
and that the action is reduced almost to nothing if a crust be
thus formed in a solution containing a minute quantity of some
powerfully protecting salt, such as phosphate of soda. It appears
to me then that a remedy may be often found in the instance of unusually
pure spring waters—either by leaving the new pipes filled
with the water for a few months, care being taken not draw any water
from them in the interval,—or perhaps even more effectually by
filling the pipes for a similar period with a solution containing about
a 25,000th of phosphate of soda. I had determined to try the latter
plan with the pipes in the Dumfries-shire case mentioned above, but
recommended that in the first instance the pipes should be left for a
few months full of the water of the spring, and the stop-cocks kept
carefully shut; and on this being done for three or four months, it
was found that the water afterwards passed with scarcely any impregnation
of lead, and what little was contracted at first gradually diminished
in the course of time.—Probably neither of these methods
will be of more than temporary use, when the chief or only salt present
is chloride of sodium, even though the proportion be considerable.
Both plans seemed to answer for a time in the instance which
occurred at Lord Aberdeen’s (p. <a href='#Page_411'>411</a>); but after a while the action
recommenced, probably owing to the deposited carbonate being
slowly dissolved. At the time of publication of my paper in the
Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the cure appeared
complete, and was there represented to be so.</p>

<p class='c006'>I should add that an effectual remedy has been lately introduced
by a patent invention for covering lead pipes both externally and
internally with a thin coating of tin.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the remarks now made on the action of water on lead no account
has been taken of the effect of the galvanic fluid in promoting
it. This, however, is a most important co-operating agent, or rather
perhaps it ought to be considered a distinct power; for it acts with
energy where water alone acts least, namely, when there is saline
matter in solution, because then a galvanic current of greater force is
excited. In general it is necessary that two different metals be present
in the water before galvanic action be excited; but a very
slight difference may be sufficient. For example, it seems enough
that the lead contain here and there impurities, constituting alloys
slightly different from the general mass of the pipe or cistern. It
is probable that galvanic action may be thus excited by the joinings
being soldered with the usual mixture of lead and the more
fusible metals. At least I have seen pipes deeply corroded externally,
when made of sheets of lead rolled and soldered; and the action
was deepest on each side of the solder, which had itself entirely
escaped corrosion. Even inequalities in the composition of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>lead may have the same effect. Sheet lead long exposed to air or
water is sometimes observed to be corroded in particular spots;
and these will always be found in the neighbourhood of parts of
the metal differing in colour, hardness or texture from the general
mass. I have not analyzed such spots; but I conceive the supposition
now made is exceedingly probable, and supplies a ready explanation
of the corrosion. Similar effects may arise simply from
fragments of other metals lying long in contact with the lead.
They may also arise from portions of mortar being allowed to lie on
the lead; but the action here is not galvanic.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have no doubt that many of the instances of unusually rapid corrosion
of lead by water, such as that mentioned by Dr. Wall [p. <a href='#Page_410'>410</a>]
are really owing, not to the simple action of water, but to an action
excited obscurely in one or other of the ways now mentioned.</p>

<h5 class='c011'><i>Of the Action of Acidulous Fluids on Lead and its Oxide.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>Water acidulated with various acids acts on lead with different
degrees of rapidity.</p>

<p class='c006'>The effect of acidulation with <i>carbonic acid</i> has not yet been accurately
ascertained. The effect of <i>sulphuric acid</i> is peculiar. Distilled
water feebly acidulated with that acid acts much less rapidly
on lead than when quite pure. Thus I have found that, if it contained
a 4000th or even only a 7000th of sulphuric acid, fifty grains
of lead kept in it for thirty-two days gained a seventh or a twelfth of
a grain in weight, and were covered with beautiful crystals of sulphate
of lead. A minute trace of lead could be detected in the
water. <i>Hydrochloric acid</i> is somewhat more active as a solvent.
Distilled water containing a 3000th of that acid acquired in thirty-two
days a sweetish taste, and yielded by evaporation a considerable
quantity of muriate of lead, while the lead rods lost weight, and
were covered with acicular crystals of the same salt.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is much more important, however, to consider the effects of the
vegetable acids on lead and its oxide, because their solvent power
is a fruitful source of the accidental as well as intentional adulteration
of many articles of food and drink.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Acetic acid</i> in the form of common vinegar, even when much diluted,
attacks and dissolves metallic lead, if by exposing the surface
of the fluid to the air, a constant supply of oxygen be maintained to
produce oxidation. The <i>citric acid</i> will attack it under the same
circumstances, but acts more slowly. In a solution of five grains of
citric acid in twenty-four parts or two drachms of water, three lead
rods lost two grains in weight in nine weeks. The greater part of
the citrate of lead separated slowly in white powdery crystals; but a
small portion was dissolved by the excess of acid, and imparted to
the fluid a pleasant sweetness. <i>Tartaric acid</i> acts much less energetically.
In a comparative experiment with the last, the lead
gained nearly half a grain in weight by acquiring a crystalline coat
of tartrate of lead. But I could not detect any lead in solution; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>there was no loose powder. The tartrate of lead is very sparingly
soluble in an excess of its acid, so that a sweet taste cannot be communicated
by it to a fluid acidulated with tartaric acid. <i>Malic acid</i>,
according to MM. Chevallier and Ollivier, acts so quickly as a solvent,
that if a solution be kept in a lead vessel for three hours, the
metal may be detected in the fluid by any of its ordinary tests.<a id='r1260' /><a href='#f1260' class='c013'><sup>[1260]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The acids act with greater rapidity on the protoxide of lead than
on the metal; and the presence of air is of course not required to
enable them to effect its solution.</p>

<p class='c006'>The solvent power of the acids is liable to be counteracted by various
substances; the operation of which, however, has not been
well ascertained. It appears that substances containing gallic acid
or tannin throw down the lead; and on this account various adulterations
which would otherwise take place are either prevented or
corrected. It has been also ascertained by Proust, that the vegetable
acids do not attack lead when it is alloyed with tin. For as the
latter metal has a stronger attraction than the former for acids, no lead
can be oxidated before the tin undergoes that change.<a id='r1261' /><a href='#f1261' class='c013'><sup>[1261]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>From what has been said of the action of the vegetable acids, it
follows that the preparation or preservation of articles of food and
drink in leaden vessels is fraught with danger. For, if they contain
a vegetable acid, more particularly the acetic, as many of them do,
and if they are allowed to remain in the vessel for a moderate length
of time, they will be apt to be impregnated with the metal. In this
way lead has been often insidiously introduced into the food of man.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus milk has been poisoned by being kept in leaden troughs.
An instance of the kind has been related by Dr. Darwin. A farmer’s
daughter used to wipe the cream from the edge of the milk which
was kept in leaden cisterns, and being fond of cream, had a habit of
licking it from her finger. She was seized in consequence with the
symptoms of lead colic, afterwards with paralytic weakness of the
hands, and she died of general exhaustion.<a id='r1262' /><a href='#f1262' class='c013'><sup>[1262]</sup></a> The circumstances
under which the lead is acted on have not been carefully examined.
It appears to be sometimes used with safety. It will of course be
dissolved, if the milk should become sour.</p>

<p class='c006'>Rum has been also supposed to be sometimes adulterated with
lead by being left in contact with the metal. The dry belly-ache of
the West Indies, which appears to be the same disease with the lead
colic, has been ascribed by some to the same cause. But on this
subject precise information is still wanted. Dr. J. Hunter has stated,
that an epidemic colic, which attacked three of our regiments in Jamaica
during the years 1781 and 1782, and which seized almost
every man of them, was traced by him to the presence of lead in the
rum; and he endeavours to show that the spirit might dissolve the
lead in passing through the leaden worms of the distilling apparatus.<a id='r1263' /><a href='#f1263' class='c013'><sup>[1263]</sup></a>
He adds in another work, that, according to information communicated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>by Dr. Franklin, the legislature of Massachusetts passed an act
in 1723, prohibiting the use of leaden still-heads and worms in the
distillation of spirituous liquors.<a id='r1264' /><a href='#f1264' class='c013'><sup>[1264]</sup></a> It is certain that rum has been
often impregnated with lead; but it is by no means clear that Dr.
Hunter has successfully accounted for the mode in which the adulteration
is effected.</p>

<p class='c006'>Wine has been accidentally impregnated in like manner, in consequence
of the bottles having been rinsed with shot, and some of
the shot left behind. An interesting example of this has been related
in the Philosophical Magazine. Severe abdominal symptoms were
caused by a bottle of wine; and the cause was discovered to be the
action of the wine on some shot in the bottom of the bottle. The
shot had been so completely dissolved, that it crumbled when squeezed
between the fingers.<a id='r1265' /><a href='#f1265' class='c013'><sup>[1265]</sup></a> The illness in this instance must have been
owing to the arsenic contained in the shot, because the quantity of
lead was hardly sufficient to excite violent symptoms.—At one time
home-made British wines must have been frequently adulterated with
lead, from the makers being ignorant of the dangerous nature of the
adulteration. Sir G. Baker quotes the following receipt in a popular
cookery book of his time: “<i>To hinder wine from turning.</i>—Put a
pound of melted lead in fair water into your cask, pretty warm, and
stop it close.”<a id='r1266' /><a href='#f1266' class='c013'><sup>[1266]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>But by far the most remarkable adulteration of the kind now under
review is that of cider. At one time a disease in every respect the
same as the lead colic used to prevail in some of the south-west
counties of England at the cider season; and it was generally ascribed,
in consequence apparently of the opinion of Huxham, to the working
people indulging too freely in their favourite beverage during the
season of plenty. The subject, however, was carefully investigated
in 1767 by Sir George Baker, who succeeded in proving, that the
disease arose from the cider being impregnated with lead, sometimes
designedly for the purpose of correcting its acescency when spoiled,
but chiefly by accident, in consequence of the metal being used for
various purposes in the construction of the cider-house apparatus.
The substance of his researches is,—that a disease in all respects
the same with the lead colic was in his time so prevalent in Devonshire
as to have supplied 289 cases to the Exeter Hospital in five
years, and 80 to the Bath Infirmary in a single season (1766); while,
on the contrary, it was little, if at all, known in the adjoining counties
of Gloucester, Worcester, and Hereford, although cider is there an
equally common drink among all ranks:—that in the latter counties
lead was seldom or never used in constructing the apparatus of the
cider-houses, while in Devonshire it was used sometimes for lining
the presses, but more commonly for fastening the iron cramps, and
filling up the stone joinings of the grinding troughs, and for conveying
the liquor from vessel to vessel:—that lead did not exist in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>cider of Herefordshire, but might be detected both in the ripe cider,
and more especially in the must, of Devonshire:—that from eighteen
bottles of cider, a year in bottle, 4½ grains of metallic lead were procured.<a id='r1267' /><a href='#f1267' class='c013'><sup>[1267]</sup></a>
The accuracy of these facts, and the soundness of the conclusions
which Sir George Baker drew from them have been universally
admitted; and lead is now, I believe, completely excluded
from the cider apparatus.</p>

<p class='c006'>Notwithstanding the notoriety of these facts, accidents from adulterated
cider seem still to occur occasionally in France. So recently
as 1841 a set of cases which presented the incipient symptoms of
lead colic were traced by MM. Chevallier and Ollivier to cider having
been adulterated with lead to the amount of nearly two grains and
a half per quart, in consequence of a publican having kept his cider
for two days in a vessel lined with lead.<a id='r1268' /><a href='#f1268' class='c013'><sup>[1268]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>If lead is previously oxidated, the presence of vegetable acids in
articles kept in contact with it is still more likely to give rise to a
poisonous impregnation, than in the case of lead itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of accidental adulterations of this kind the most important is that
which arises from the action of vegetable acids on the glazing of
earthenware. This glaze is well known to contain generally a considerable
quantity of oxide of lead, and in consequence is more or
less easily dissolved by vegetable acids. A good example has been
noticed by Dr. Beck.<a id='r1269' /><a href='#f1269' class='c013'><sup>[1269]</sup></a> A family in Massachusetts, consisting of
eight persons, were all seized with spasmodic colic, obstinate costiveness,
and vomiting; and the disease was satisfactorily traced to a
store of stewed apples, which had been kept some months in an
earthenware vessel and had corroded the lead glazing. Another interesting
example has been described by Dr. Hohnbaum of Hildburghausen.
A family of five persons were all violently affected for
a long time with spasmodic colic, and some with partial palsy.
After examining many articles of food, Dr. Hohnbaum at last found
that the vinegar for dressing their salads was kept in a large earthenware
vessel capable of holding eight or ten quarts, and glazed with
lead; that an ounce of vinegar remaining in the vessel contained no
less than nine grains of lead; and that the whole glazing of the
vessel was completely dissolved.<a id='r1270' /><a href='#f1270' class='c013'><sup>[1270]</sup></a> Accidents like this appear from
the statements of the same author to have been common in Germany
not long ago. Luzuriaga attributes the great prevalence of colic in
Madrid and the neighbourhood to the general use in the kitchen of
earthenware glazed with lead.<a id='r1271' /><a href='#f1271' class='c013'><sup>[1271]</sup></a> Jacob imputes it to the same cause.<a id='r1272' /><a href='#f1272' class='c013'><sup>[1272]</sup></a>
But others have doubted the accuracy of this explanation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The effect of acids on lead glazing appears to be variable. Sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>they hardly act on it at all.<a id='r1273' /><a href='#f1273' class='c013'><sup>[1273]</sup></a> The difference probably depends
on differences in the composition of the glaze. Gmelin says, that if
there is little oxide of lead present, acids and fat do not corrode it;
but that potters often use too much, to render the glaze more fusible;
and that then it is easily corroded.<a id='r1274' /><a href='#f1274' class='c013'><sup>[1274]</sup></a> Westrumb states, that, if the
lead glaze is thoroughly vitrified and not cracked, the strongest acids
do not attack it.<a id='r1275' /><a href='#f1275' class='c013'><sup>[1275]</sup></a> Farther experiments are still required to elucidate
this subject.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not, however, by accident only that the food or drink of man
is subject to be poisoned with lead. Many articles are adulterated
with it designedly for a variety of purposes. These adulterations it
is necessary for the medical jurist to study.</p>

<p class='c006'>No kind of adulteration with lead is more common than that of
wine; which, when too acid and harsh from the first, or rendered
acescent by decay, may be materially improved in taste by the addition
of litharge.</p>

<p class='c006'>The practice of correcting unsound wines in this way seems to
have been well known at an early period. Betwixt the years 1498
and 1577, various decrees were passed against it by the German
emperors; and in some provinces the crime was even punished
capitally.<a id='r1276' /><a href='#f1276' class='c013'><sup>[1276]</sup></a> For some time afterwards the dangerous effects of the
practice appear to have been lost sight of in Germany. But towards
the close of the seventeenth century, the attention of physicians and
legislators in that country was pointedly directed to the subject by
various writers in the <i>Acta Germanica</i>.<a id='r1277' /><a href='#f1277' class='c013'><sup>[1277]</sup></a> The same practice has been
long prevalent in France. The famous endemic colic of Poitou,
which appeared in 1572, and raged for sixty or seventy years, has
been with justice ascribed in modern times to the adulteration of
wine with lead, and has given to the lead colic its scientific name of
<i>colica pictonum</i>. More recently, the practice became exceedingly
prevalent in Paris. About the year 1750, the farmers-general found
that for some years before that, 30,000 hogsheads of sour wine were
annually brought into Paris for the alleged purpose of making vinegar,
while the previous yearly imports did not exceed 1200. An
inquiry was accordingly set on foot; which led to the discovery, that
the vinegar merchants corrected the sour wines with litharge, and
thus made them marketable.<a id='r1278' /><a href='#f1278' class='c013'><sup>[1278]</sup></a> Notwithstanding the active system of
medical police in the French capital, the crime is not yet eradicated.
Indeed the small tart wines used so abundantly there by all ranks,
hold out great encouragement and facilities to its perpetration.</p>

<p class='c006'>The process employed for correcting the acescency of wine is not
precisely known. Some wines are easily corrected; Mérat found
that a bottle of harsh wine, which had a sharp, bitterish, rather acrid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>taste, took up in forty-eight hours twelve grains of litharge, and
became palatable.<a id='r1279' /><a href='#f1279' class='c013'><sup>[1279]</sup></a> With other wines this simple method will not
answer, because the colour is destroyed, and a taste is substituted
which has no resemblance to that of the genuine wine. Thus Orfila
remarked, that Burgundy, neutralized with litharge, acquired a
saccharine taste and became pale-red, because the insoluble salts of
lead which were formed, combined with and removed the colouring
matter.<a id='r1280' /><a href='#f1280' class='c013'><sup>[1280]</sup></a> On the whole, it is probable that the adulteration of wine
with lead can only be practised with success on the common tart
kinds, such as those used by the lower orders on the continent.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some excellent observations have been published on this subject
by Fourcroy. In order to render what he has said intelligible, it is necessary
to premise, that in the course of the fermentation of wine, the
bitartrate of potass, which accelerates the conversion of the sugar of
the fruit into alcohol, is itself partly converted into malic acid; that
in sound wine, therefore, there is a mixture of tartaric and malic
acids; but that if the malic acid originally existed in the fruit in too
great abundance, the fermentation of the sugar is imperfect, and the
wine is consequently both too acid and too weak; and lastly, that
all wines, if neglected, are apt to ferment too much, in consequence
of which they pass the vinous stage of fermentation, and become impregnated
with acetic acid.<a id='r1281' /><a href='#f1281' class='c013'><sup>[1281]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Now Fourcroy found that the oxide and other preparations of lead
correct acescency and harshness in wines, not so much by throwing
down the acids, as by combining with them in solution, and imparting
to the liquor the peculiar sweetness of lead. Hence tart wines,
which owe their acidity to too great a proportion of tartaric acid or
bitartrate of potass, cannot be improved by adulteration with oxide
of lead. For the bitartrate of potass cannot act at all as a solvent
on the oxides or carbonate of lead, and even pure tartaric acid takes
up so little, that wine containing it, could not acquire the sweet taste
which is the purpose of the adulteration. This statement I have
confirmed. But the case is very different when the wine contains
acetic acid, the presence of which is the general cause of spoiling or
acidity. For Fourcroy remarked, that acetic acid dissolves not only
oxide and carbonate of lead, but likewise the tartrate, notwithstanding
its great insolubility in water or in its own acid. Hence the presence
of tartaric acid in a wine spoiled by co-existence of the acetic,
will not prevent the liquor from taking up oxide of lead in sufficient
quantity to acquire an improved taste and flavour. Nay, an obvious
mode of correcting excessive acidity, produced by too much tartaric
acid, is to add tartaric acid, and then to treat the mixture with oxide
of lead. Fourcroy farther thinks, that the malic acid possesses the
same solvent power as the acetic over tartrate of lead, and that its
presence may therefore be the reason why some tart wines, which do
not contain the acetic acid, become nevertheless impregnated with
the poison. The solvent power of acetic acid is increased by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>presence of other vegetable principles in the wine.<a id='r1282' /><a href='#f1282' class='c013'><sup>[1282]</sup></a> I may add, that
I have found the citric acid to possess the same property with the
acetic and malic acids. It dissolves so much of the tartrate of lead
as to acquire a pleasant sweetness, unmixed with metallic astringency.</p>

<p class='c006'>The practice of adulterating wine with lead does not seem to have
been ever pursued to any material extent in Britain. Home-made
wines may be adulterated in this way, as may be inferred from the
receipt formerly quoted for preventing acescency. But I have never
heard that any such adulteration has been suspected in the foreign
wines usually drunk in this country. Considering, indeed, the nature
of these wines, and the class of people who alone make use of
them, it is not likely that adulteration with lead could be practised
with success. If the foreign wines used in Britain should become
acescent, lead could hardly restore their taste so thoroughly as to impose
on the consumer.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sometimes spirituous liquors and preserves have been adulterated
with lead, in consequence of sugar of lead having been used to clarify
them, or to render them colourless. Cadet de Gassicourt says
it is a common practice in France to clarify honey and sugar of grapes,
and to make brandy pale in this way; and M. Boudet has detected
lead in many samples of these articles in Paris.<a id='r1283' /><a href='#f1283' class='c013'><sup>[1283]</sup></a> Hollands has likewise
been poisoned in the same manner. Dr. Shearman mentions
his having detected an extensive adulteration of smuggled Geneva
by an excise officer, which had been sold and dispersed over an extensive
tract of country, and which committed great ravages among
the inhabitants.<a id='r1284' /><a href='#f1284' class='c013'><sup>[1284]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The adulterations hitherto noticed take place through means of the
chemical action of the adulterated articles on lead or its oxide. Some
other substances are occasionally contaminated by its compounds
being merely mechanically mixed with them. There is no end to
the number and variety of adulterations of this kind. But the following
will serve as examples. Gaubius once detected an adulteration
of butter with white lead at a time when it was very scarce in
Flanders, owing to a dreadful mortality among cattle.<a id='r1285' /><a href='#f1285' class='c013'><sup>[1285]</sup></a> An instance
of poisoning with lead, in consequence of cheese having been mixed
with red lead, is mentioned in the Repertory of Arts.<a id='r1286' /><a href='#f1286' class='c013'><sup>[1286]</sup></a> This variety
deserves to be remembered. Red lead was at one time a good deal
used to communicate the peculiar reddish-yellow colour, which is
supposed to characterize the finer qualities of certain kinds of English
cheese. In the Transactions of the Medical Society of London, a singular
instance has been related by Mr. Deering, of lead colic attacking
a whole family, and proving fatal to two of them, in consequence
of the insidious introduction of white lead into the body. Although
the nature of the symptoms in the several cases left no doubt that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>lead was the cause of them, it was long before the source of the
poison was discovered. Every vessel and article used in the kitchen
was in vain examined; when at length it was discovered that the
sugar used by the family had been taken from a barrel which had
formerly contained white lead, and that, as the sugar from the centre
of the barrel had been dug out, and given away to various friends,
the outer part of it next the white lead was chiefly used by the family
themselves.<a id='r1287' /><a href='#f1287' class='c013'><sup>[1287]</sup></a></p>

<h5 class='c011'><i>Process for detecting Lead in Organic Mixtures.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>In the first place, a little nitric acid should be added to the suspected
matter before filtration; for nitric acid redissolves any insoluble
compound formed by the salts of lead with albumen and other
animal principles, as well as some of those formed with vegetable
principles; and consequently renders it more probable, that the poison
will be detected in the first part of the analysis, if present at
all.<a id='r1288' /><a href='#f1288' class='c013'><sup>[1288]</sup></a> This being done, sulphuretted-hydrogen gas is to be transmitted
through the fluid part of the mixture; and if a dark-coloured
precipitate is formed, the whole is to be boiled and filtered to collect
the precipitate.</p>

<p class='c006'>In order to ascertain that the precipitate positively contains lead,
those who are accustomed to use the blowpipe may put the sulphuret
into a little hole in a bit of charcoal, and reduce it by the fine point
of a blowpipe-flame; when a single globule is procured, which is
easily distinguished by its lustre and softness. A better process, for
those not accustomed to the blowpipe, and perhaps a better test of
the existence of lead in all circumstances, is to heat the sulphuret to
redness in a tube, and to treat it with strong nitric acid, without heat
or with the aid of a gentle heat only. The lead is thus dissolved
without the sulphur being acted on. The solution is then to be
diluted with water, filtered, evaporated to dryness, and gently heated
to expel the excess of nitric acid. If the residue be dissolved in
water, it will present the usual characters of a lead solution when
subjected to the proper liquid tests. Of these the hydriodate of potass
is to be preferred when the quantity is too small for trying more of
them. But for this purpose care must be taken to expel all the excess
of nitric acid, because an excess will strike a yellow colour with the
test though lead be not present.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the preceding process should not detect lead in the filtered part
of the mixed fluid, then the insoluble matter left on the filter is to be
incinerated, and the residuum dissolved in nitric acid, and tested as
above. This branch, however, will be rarely required, if lead be
present, because the precaution of adding nitric acid, previous to
filtration, dissolves the lead from most of its compounds which are
insoluble in water. The process of incineration in medico-legal analysis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>generally should be avoided if possible, as it is not easily managed
by unpractised persons.—The present branch of the process
of analysis will be particularly required for the contents of the stomach
or vomited matter, when any sulphate or phosphate has been
given as an antidote.</p>

<p class='c006'>A process different from the preceding, and analogous to those for
detecting copper and antimony in complex organic mixtures, has
lately been proposed by Professor Orfila, especially for those cases in
which lead is to be sought for in the textures of the body, where
death is supposed to have been occasioned by it. The subject of
analysis, such as the liver, spleen, or kidneys, being cut into small
pieces, and boiled in distilled water, and the filtered decoction being
evaporated to dryness, the extract is to be carbonized with nitric acid
as directed under the head of copper (p. <a href='#Page_357'>357</a>); and care must be
taken that the heat be not raised to redness, so as to inflame the
mass. The residuum is then to be boiled with nitric acid; the solution
being evaporated to dryness to expel the excess of acid, the saline
matter left is to be redissolved and acted on by hydrosulphuric
acid gas; and the sulphuret thus formed may be recognized by the
means mentioned above.<a id='r1289' /><a href='#f1289' class='c013'><sup>[1289]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>A question has been recently started, whether all the processes for
detecting lead in the tissues of the human body are not rendered fallacious
by the alleged existence of lead in the healthy animal textures.
In the first place, however, it is doubtful, as will be seen presently,
whether lead ever exists naturally in the animal organs. But besides,
the fallacy, if a real one, is obviated by the process of Orfila; who
states that lead, naturally combined in the animal tissues, cannot be
indicated by his method, if the animal matter be charred by nitric
acid without deflagration. And farther, in regard to the tissues of
the stomach in cases of acute poisoning with the preparations of lead,
it appears that in most instances there may be seen on the villous coat
little white points, which are blackened by hydrosulphuric acid, a
phenomenon never occasioned by lead naturally contained in the substance
of the membrane. [See p. <a href='#Page_439'>439</a>.]</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> II.—<i>Of the Action of Lead and the Symptoms it excites in Man.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The effects of the preparations of lead on the body are very
striking. They differ according to the rapidity with which it enters
the system. Large doses of its soluble salts cause symptoms of irritant
poisoning. The gradual introduction of any of its oxidated preparations
in minute quantities brings on a peculiar and now well-known
variety of colic, which is often followed by partial palsy, and
in violent cases by apoplexy.</p>

<p class='c006'>The physiological effects and mode of action of the soluble salts
in irritating doses have been examined experimentally by Professor
Orfila, M. Gaspard, Dr. Schloepfer, and Dr. Campbell. Their experiments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>agree in showing that these poisons have a direct irritating
action, and a remote operation of an unknown kind; but the results
obtained by different experimentalists differ as to some of the details.
The acetate may be taken as a type of the whole genus.</p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila found that it was hardly possible to bring dogs under the
action of the acetate if swallowed in solution, because they speedily
discharged it all by vomiting. But if the salt was given in powder
in the dose of half an ounce, or if the solution was retained in the
stomach by a ligature on the gullet, the symptoms produced were
those of violent irritation in the first instance, succeeded by extreme
weakness and death, sometimes in nine hours, more generally not till
the second day or later. The appearances in the body were unnatural
whiteness of the villous coat when death was rapid, and vascular
redness when death was slower. The whiteness in the former
case Orfila ascribes to chemical action. But as neither this appearance
nor the redness in the latter case was considerable, while at the
same time the symptoms were not those of continuous irritation, he
was led to doubt whether the poison causes death in consequence of
its irritant properties. And the phenomena observed by him when
acetate of lead was injected into the jugular vein prove that death is
owing to certain remote effects. Introduced through this channel
thirteen grains killed a dog almost immediately, death being preceded
by no other symptom except convulsive respiration; five grains
killed another in five days, and the leading symptoms were weariness,
languor, staggering, and slight convulsions, none of which
symptoms appeared till the third day; and it is remarkable that in
neither animal could he find any morbid appearance on dissection.<a id='r1290' /><a href='#f1290' class='c013'><sup>[1290]</sup></a>
Mr. Blake states that large doses, such as a drachm, suddenly arrest
the heart’s action; but that small doses of three grains, injected into
the jugular vein, cause diminished action of that organ, and afterwards
gorging and hepatization of the lungs; and that when injected
backwards into the aorta from the axillary artery, this salt occasions
obstruction of the capillary circulation, indicated by increased arterial
pressure,—and then an action on the nervous system, producing
insensibility, violent movements of the tail, and at last arrestment of
the respiration. It may be inferred from Mr. Blake’s researches that
lead obstructs both the systemic and pulmonary capillaries, that it
acts powerfully on the nervous centre, and that it likewise depresses
the heart’s action when the dose is large.<a id='r1291' /><a href='#f1291' class='c013'><sup>[1291]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The experiments of Gaspard coincide with those of Orfila in assigning
considerable activity to the acetate of lead when it is directly
introduced into the blood,—the quantity of two or four grains generally
causing death in three or five days.<a id='r1292' /><a href='#f1292' class='c013'><sup>[1292]</sup></a> The experiments of Campbell
farther show that death may be induced by applying it to a
wound, and that the symptoms antecedent to death resemble those
remarked by Orfila when it is injected into a vein.<a id='r1293' /><a href='#f1293' class='c013'><sup>[1293]</sup></a> But the two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>last experimentalists differ from Orfila in assigning to sugar of lead a
property like that possessed by arsenic, of acting on the alimentary
canal, even when applied to a wound, or directly introduced into
the blood. For Campbell found the stomach corrugated and red,
and the small intestines also vascular; while Gaspard not only observed
analogous appearances after death, but even also witnessed
all the symptoms of violent dysentery during life. In farther proof
of the local irritating power of this poison, it may be added, that
when sugar of lead was injected into the rectum Campbell found it
to cause purging, tenesmus, itching of the anus, and great debility.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have found that the nitrate of lead is powerfully irritant and
corrosive in the dose of 400 grains. This quantity dissolved in four
ounces of water killed a strong dog in sixteen hours, producing violent
efforts to vomit and diarrhœa. And after death the whole inner
membrane of the gullet and stomach, and the villi of the upper half
of the small intestines, were uniformly white, brittle, and evidently
disintegrated; and the mucous coat of the great intestines was bright
red in parallel lines.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only inquiries I have hitherto met with, which assign to lead
in continued small doses the power of producing in animals the peculiar
colic and palsy often produced by it in man are those of Schloepfer,
related in his thesis on the effects of poisons when injected into
the windpipe. He found that the acetate, introduced through this
channel in successive doses of ten grains, brought on all the symptoms
of <i>colica pictonum</i>, preceded by oppressed breathing, and ending
fatally with palsy and convulsions in the course of three weeks.<a id='r1294' /><a href='#f1294' class='c013'><sup>[1294]</sup></a>
More recently Dr. Wibmer, in the course of some experiments on
the long-continued use of acetate and carbonate of lead, remarked
weakness and stiffness of the limbs in dogs; and in the rabbit I have
observed in the like circumstances gradually increasing weakness,
ending in complete palsy of the fore-legs.</p>

<p class='c006'>The compounds of lead seem to produce their effects on the animal
body through the medium of absorption. At all events they are absorbed
in the course of their action, and are diffused throughout the
animal textures. Lead was long sought for with variable and dubious
success in the fluids and solids of men and animals killed by
it or labouring under its effects. But the late improvements in physiological
science and chemical analysis have demonstrated, that it
may always be detected in favourable circumstances in the liver and
kidneys, often in the spleen and in the urine, and sometimes even in
the muscles. Wibmer was the first who satisfactorily proved its
presence. In dogs poisoned slowly by the acetate or carbonate of
lead in frequent small doses, and dying with symptoms of lead-colic
and palsy, he found the metal distinctly in the liver, muscles, and
spinal cord, and more obscurely in the blood, by drying and deflagrating
the animal matter with nitre, acting on the residue with
nitric acid, neutralizing the solution, and testing it with hydrosulphuric
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>acid, carbonate of potash, and iodide of potassium.<a id='r1295' /><a href='#f1295' class='c013'><sup>[1295]</sup></a> On
repeating these experiments, I succeeded in detecting lead in very
minute quantity in the lumbar and dorsal muscles of rabbits, but not
any where else.<a id='r1296' /><a href='#f1296' class='c013'><sup>[1296]</sup></a> Professor Orfila has since frequently found lead,
by means of his method of analysis described at page <a href='#Page_424'>424</a>, in the
kidneys, liver, and urine of animals which had taken large doses of
acetate of lead, and once in the urine of a girl who had swallowed
above an ounce of the acetate twenty-five hours before the urine
was passed.<a id='r1297' /><a href='#f1297' class='c013'><sup>[1297]</sup></a> About the same time M. Ausset, under the directions
of Lassaigne, detected lead largely in the blood and urine of a horse
during life, and in the liver and kidneys after death.<a id='r1298' /><a href='#f1298' class='c013'><sup>[1298]</sup></a> Mr. Alfred
Taylor found traces of it in the milk of a cow accidentally poisoned
by carbonate of lead.<a id='r1299' /><a href='#f1299' class='c013'><sup>[1299]</sup></a> M. Tanquerel Desplanches says it has been
detected by M. Devergie and himself in the palsied parts of persons
who had died of colica pictonum;<a id='r1300' /><a href='#f1300' class='c013'><sup>[1300]</sup></a> and Dr. Budd observes, that Mr.
Miller found lead in abundance in the paralysed extensors of the
hand in a man who died in a London Hospital of the epileptic form
of the effects of this poison.<a id='r1301' /><a href='#f1301' class='c013'><sup>[1301]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>These facts seem to outweigh the negative results obtained by
others. Nor are they invalidated by the alleged existence of lead in
the healthy animal textures. For in the first place,—although M.
Devergie says he has always found traces of lead in the substance of
the stomach and intestines of men and women, who had not used
preparations of lead or been in any way exposed to it,<a id='r1302' /><a href='#f1302' class='c013'><sup>[1302]</sup></a> and Professor
Orfila confirmed these observations by also finding traces of
lead in the alimentary canal under similar circumstances,<a id='r1303' /><a href='#f1303' class='c013'><sup>[1303]</sup></a>—the
conclusion flowing from their researches is after all doubtful; for in
a later inquiry MM. Danger and Flandin could not find any lead,
unless it had been purposely introduced into the body.<a id='r1304' /><a href='#f1304' class='c013'><sup>[1304]</sup></a> And secondly,—Devergie
adds to his remarks, that the quantity of lead
he found in the textures and secretions of those who had died of
lead-colic was far greater than in those who had not been exposed to
lead preparations before death; and Orfila ascertained that the process
by which he detects adventitious lead is incapable of indicating that
which may be present naturally in the body.<a id='r1305' /><a href='#f1305' class='c013'><sup>[1305]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It is probable that all the preparations of lead are poisonous except
the metal, and perhaps also the sulphuret. The experimentalists
at the Veterinary School of Lyons found that nearly four ounces of
the metal might be given to a dog without even vomiting being excited;
and Orfila remarked that an ounce of carefully prepared sulphuret
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>had as little effect.<a id='r1306' /><a href='#f1306' class='c013'><sup>[1306]</sup></a> The effects, which have been occasionally
ascribed to lead-shot, and which will be mentioned by and
by [<i>see</i> p. <a href='#Page_435'>435</a>], seem at variance with these experiments, but cannot
outweigh such precise negative results. It is probable that irritant
poisoning can be produced only by those compounds which are soluble,
such as the acetate, subacetate, and nitrate. It appears indeed
from the experiments of Orfila with the acetate and my own with the
nitrate, that these compounds are true corrosives, and of no mean
energy when given in large doses moderately diluted.</p>

<p class='c006'>The insoluble compounds, such as the carbonate, red oxide and
protoxide, possess little irritant power. The experimentalists of
Lyons found litharge to be irritant in large doses of half an ounce.<a id='r1307' /><a href='#f1307' class='c013'><sup>[1307]</sup></a>
Orfila gave dogs large doses of the red oxide and carbonate without
observing any signs of irritation in the stomach. A case has been
published of a young woman who swallowed accidentally an ounce
and a half of the carbonate without any bad effect whatever either at
the time or afterwards;<a id='r1308' /><a href='#f1308' class='c013'><sup>[1308]</sup></a> and Dr. Ogston of Aberdeen has informed
me he met with a similar case, that of a girl who took an ounce
with the view of destroying herself, but without sustaining any harm
whatever. In a remarkable case, published by Mr. Cross of London,
in which six drachms were taken accidentally by a pregnant female
instead of magnesia, vomiting and violent colic were produced, and
afterwards fainting, paralysis of the extensor muscles, and contraction
of the flexors; all of which symptoms, however, after enduring
without abatement till eight hours after the poison was swallowed,
gradually disappeared under antidotes and laxatives. But such a
case bears no great resemblance either to the acute or chronic form
of poisoning with lead, and was probably hysterical.<a id='r1309' /><a href='#f1309' class='c013'><sup>[1309]</sup></a> Orfila has
found that an ounce and a quarter of sulphate of lead had no effect
whatever on a dog.<a id='r1310' /><a href='#f1310' class='c013'><sup>[1310]</sup></a> Mr. Taylor mentions a case where the chloride
of lead caused vomiting, but no other ill consequence.<a id='r1311' /><a href='#f1311' class='c013'><sup>[1311]</sup></a> Dr.
Cogswell found that three drachms of iodide of lead caused in a dog
merely depression and weakness for a few days; but forty grains
killed a rabbit in twelve days, with symptoms of exhaustion and
constipation; and doses frequently repeated, to the amount of eleven
drachms in eighteen days, killed a dog under symptoms nearly the
same.<a id='r1312' /><a href='#f1312' class='c013'><sup>[1312]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It may be presumed that all the compounds of lead which are soluble
in water or in the animal fluids may produce in favourable circumstances
the lead colic and palsy. Dr. A. T. Thomson, indeed,<a id='r1313' /><a href='#f1313' class='c013'><sup>[1313]</sup></a>
has endeavoured to show by some experiments, that the carbonate
is the only compound of lead which possesses this singular power;
and that if the acetate of lead produces similar effects, it is only because
that salt usually contains an excess of oxide which becomes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>carbonate from the action of free carbonic acid in the stomach and
other parts of animals, or because the salt is decomposed by double
decomposition from the accidental presence of alkaline carbonates.
It does not appear to me, however, that the researches of Dr. Thomson,
taken along with the prior inquiries of other physiologists, will
bear out this conclusion. The experiments of Wibmer in particular
would seem to show that the carbonate is at least not more active
than the acetate; nor does it appear probable that the small doses
of acetate given by him, seldom exceeding two or three grains at a
time, could yield any carbonate in the alimentary canal of a dog,
where there is commonly much free muriatic acid. Farther, in many
of the instances of lead colic related above as produced by cider,
wine, and other acid substances acting on lead or its oxide, the acid
must have been so greatly in excess, that it was scarcely possible
that carbonate of lead could have been formed afterwards by any
ordinary accident. And even supposing the carbonate to be more
active than other compounds in occasioning colic and palsy, as Dr.
Thomson’s inquiries would tend to show, the fact may be admitted
without necessarily leading to the inference, that it is the only active
compound of lead, or that other preparations must be converted into
the carbonate before they can act as slow poisons. For the superior
activity of the carbonate may be owing to the great obstinacy with
which its impalpable powder adheres to moist membranous surfaces,
and the consequent greater certainty of its ultimate absorption. It
certainly appears at least but consistent with a general law, to which
hitherto no undoubted exception has been found, that the carbonate
must be dissolved before it can act constitutionally.</p>

<p class='c006'>The symptoms observed in man from the preparations of lead are
of three kinds. One class of symptoms indicate inflammation of the
alimentary canal: another spasm of its muscles: and a third injury
of the nervous system, sometimes apoplexy, more commonly palsy,
and that almost always partial and incomplete. Each of these classes
of symptoms may exist independently of the other two; but the last
two are more commonly combined.</p>

<p class='c006'>The irritant effects of large doses of the soluble salts of lead come
first under consideration. Of these the acetate, or sugar of lead may
be taken as an example.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here it will, in the first instance, be observed that, according to
the experiments mentioned above, the acetate of lead, though certainly
an irritant poison, is not very energetic,—being much less so
than the vulgar generally believe, and far inferior to most of the
metallic poisons hitherto treated of. This farther appears from the
experience of physicians as to its effects in medicinal doses. The
acetate has been often given in pretty large doses in medical practice;
and although it has sometimes excited colic when continued
too long, ordinary irritation of the stomach seems to have been rarely
observed. Mr. Daniell, in a paper on its effects as a remedy for
mercurial salivation, states that he gave it in doses of ten grains three
times a day, and that he never observed it to excite any other unpleasant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>symptom except slight colic, which seldom came on till after
the fourth dose.<a id='r1314' /><a href='#f1314' class='c013'><sup>[1314]</sup></a> I have often given it in divided doses to the
amount of eighteen grains daily for eight or ten days, without remarking
any unpleasant symptom whatever, except once or twice
slight colic. Van Swieten even mentions a case in which it was
given to the amount of a drachm daily for ten days before it caused
any material symptom.<a id='r1315' /><a href='#f1315' class='c013'><sup>[1315]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Yet facts are not wanting to prove that acetate of lead in an improper
dose will produce violent and immediate effects. The symptoms
are then either those of simple irritation, or more commonly those of
inflammation united with the peculiar spasmodic colic of lead, and
sometimes followed by convulsions and coma, or by local palsy.</p>

<p class='c006'>In one of Sir George Baker’s essays there is an instance of immediate
and violent symptoms having been caused by a drachm taken
twice with a short interval between the doses. The subject was a
soldier who took it in milk to cure a diarrhœa. Five hours after the
first dose he was seized with pain in the bowels and a feeling of distension
round the navel. After the second these symptoms became
much more acute; and he was soon after seized with bilious vomiting,
loss of speech, delirium, and profuse sweating, while the pulse
fell down to 40. He recovered, however, with the aid of diluents
and cathartics.<a id='r1316' /><a href='#f1316' class='c013'><sup>[1316]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>A case which proved rapidly fatal has been related in a French
journal. A drummer in a French regiment, who was much given to
drinking, stole some Goulard’s extract, and drank it for wine.
Neither the first symptoms nor the dose could be ascertained. On the
second day he was affected with loss of appetite, paleness, costiveness,
and excessive debility; on the third day he had severe and
excessive colic, drawing in of the belly, loss of voice, cold sweats,
locked jaw, and violent convulsions; and he expired before the
evening of the same day. The morbid appearances will be mentioned
in their proper place. Sugar of lead was detected in the
stomach.<a id='r1317' /><a href='#f1317' class='c013'><sup>[1317]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In both these instances the disorder excited partook very much of
the character of the spasmodic colic which is caused by the gradual
introduction of lead into the body; and in the last the whole course
of the man’s illness was very like that of the worst or most acute
form of <i>colica pictonum</i>. But in another example which came under
my own notice, the symptoms were more nearly those of ordinary
irritation,—namely, vomiting, burning, and pricking pain in the throat,
gullet, and stomach, with trifling colic subsequently; but the patient
recovered in two or three days. The quantity taken was supposed
to exceed a quarter of an ounce. So, too, in a case which occurred
to M. Villeneuve of Paris, the symptoms were chiefly vomiting and
purging, with faintness and some convulsions. His patient swallowed
intentionally above an ounce of acetate of lead in solution.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>Sulphate of soda and sulphate of magnesia were given promptly as
antidotes; in an hour the symptoms had abated materially; and
next day she was well.<a id='r1318' /><a href='#f1318' class='c013'><sup>[1318]</sup></a> This was the case in which Orfila found
lead in the urine. Of the same nature, also, are two cases briefly
alluded to by Mr. Taylor, as having been caused in London in 1840
by Goulard’s extract. The subjects, who were children, were
seized with vomiting, purging, and other symptoms like those of
Asiatic cholera; and both died within thirty-six hours.<a id='r1319' /><a href='#f1319' class='c013'><sup>[1319]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In another instance, related by Mr. Iliff of London, where an
ounce of the acetate was accidentally swallowed in solution, the
symptoms were at first colic pains and vomiting, in the course of a
few hours vomiting and tenderness, and, after these symptoms receded,
a peculiar state of rigidity and numbness, which was not
entirely removed for several days. In this case no remedies were
used for three hours; and even two hours later, when the stomach-pump
was resorted to on account of the slightness of the vomiting,
lead was found in the first fluid withdrawn,—a new proof of the
feeble action of acetate of lead, compared with some other metallic
poisons.<a id='r1320' /><a href='#f1320' class='c013'><sup>[1320]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>So much for the operation of the acetate of lead in large doses.
Physicians, however, are much better acquainted with the effects of
lead when introduced in the body continuously and insidiously in
minute quantities. For all tradesmen who work much with its preparations
are apt to suffer in this way, and many other persons have
been brought under its action in consequence of articles of food and
drink being impregnated with it. The disease which is thus induced
may be divided into two distinct stages.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first stage is an affection of the alimentary canal, the leading
feature of which is violent and obstinate colic. This symptom at
times begins abruptly during a state of sound health; but much more
commonly it is ushered in by a deranged state of the stomach, not
unlike common dyspepsia, seldom so severe as to excite alarm, and
commonly imputed at first to a wrong cause. There is general uneasiness
and depression, a dingy yellowish complexion, weakness and
numbness in the limbs, a sweetish styptic taste and fetid breath, a
slaty tint of the teeth and gums, with a blue line along the margin
of the gums where they touch the teeth, a slow hard pulse, great
emaciation, loss of appetite and tendency to indigestion. This state,
which was first well characterized by Mr. Wilson<a id='r1321' /><a href='#f1321' class='c013'><sup>[1321]</sup></a> of Leadhills, and
has lately been more fully described by M. Tanquerel,<a id='r1322' /><a href='#f1322' class='c013'><sup>[1322]</sup></a> is of great moment
as apprizing the workman of the necessity of taking active measures
for preventing the more formidable effects, which otherwise are
sure to follow. Of the warning symptoms none is so invariable or so
characteristic as the blue line along the edge of the gums, an appearance
which was first noticed by Dr. Burton of St. George’s,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>London,<a id='r1323' /><a href='#f1323' class='c013'><sup>[1323]</sup></a> and has been since observed in every case of lead colic,
whether impending or present.—If alarm be not taken in time, the
obscure complaints hitherto mentioned become attended by and by
with uneasy sensations in the stomach, stretching ere long throughout
the whole belly. At the same time the stomach becomes irritable,
and the food is rejected by vomiting. Cramps in the pit of the stomach
then arise, and extend to the rest of the belly, till at length the complete
colic paroxysm is formed. The pain is sometimes pretty constant;
sometimes it ceases at intervals altogether; but much more
commonly there are remissions rather than intermissions; and it is
remarked that both the remissions and exacerbations are much longer
than those of common colic. The pain is very generally, yet not
invariably, relieved by pressure; even strong pressure seldom causes
any uneasiness, provided it be not made on the epigastrium; nay,
some patients have been known to bear, with relief to the paroxysms,
the weight of two or three people standing on the belly.<a id='r1324' /><a href='#f1324' class='c013'><sup>[1324]</sup></a> The belly
is almost always hard, the abdominal muscles being contracted:
sometimes it is rather full, more commonly the reverse, and the navel
is often drawn in so as almost to touch the spine. The bowels all
the while are obstinately costive. Either there is no discharge from
them at all; or scanty, knotty fæces are passed with much straining
and pain. This state, long supposed to depend on spasm, is now
known to arise on the contrary from paralysis, of the intestinal muscular
coat. In a few instances diarrhœa takes the place of the opposite
affection. The urine is commonly diminished. The saliva
has been described as greater than natural in quantity and bluish in
colour; but Dr. Burton says he did not observe a single instance of
this in forty cases which he carefully examined. From the beginning,
or more generally after a few hours or days, the limbs are racked
with diffuse cutting pains; which, according to Tanquerel, affect
chiefly the limbs, especially near the joints, are worst at night, are
often attended with cramps, and are relieved by pressure. The
aspect of the countenance is dull, anxious, and gloomy: in advanced
cases the expression of gloomy anxiety exceeds that of almost all
other diseases. It appears from the latest works on this disease
published in France, and particularly from the able treatise of Mérat,
that the pulse is rarely accelerated, but on the contrary often retarded.<a id='r1325' /><a href='#f1325' class='c013'><sup>[1325]</sup></a>
This does not accord with the experience of some earlier
writers;<a id='r1326' /><a href='#f1326' class='c013'><sup>[1326]</sup></a> and in the few cases I have seen in this city the pulse has
been always frequent. It cannot be questioned, however, that, as
Mérat states, fever is not essential. The skin has a dull, dirty, cadaverous
appearance, is often, though not always hot, and in either
case is bedewed with irregular, clammy, cold perspiration.</p>

<p class='c006'>This, the first stage of colica pictonum, may end in three ways.
In the first place, the patient may recover at once from it as from an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>ordinary colic; and it is consolatory to know, that a first attack,
taken under timely management, is for the most part easily made
to terminate in that favourable manner. In such circumstances it
rarely endures beyond eight days. But it is exceedingly apt to
recur, if, for example, the patient expose himself to what in ordinary
circumstances would cause merely a common colic or diarrhœa;
and if he returns to a trade which exposes him again to the
poison of lead, the disease is sure to recur sooner or later, and repeatedly,
unless he observes the greatest precautions. In one or
other of these returns, sometimes even in the first attack, the colic is
not succeeded by complete recovery, but gives place to another more
obstinate and more alarming disease. This secondary affection is of
two sorts. One, which occurs chiefly in fatal cases, is a species of
apoplexy. The other, which does not of itself prove fatal, is partial
palsy.</p>

<p class='c006'>In violent and neglected cases of colica pictonum, the colic becomes
attended in a few days with giddiness, great debility, torpor,
and sometimes delirium; as the torpor advances the pains in the belly
and limbs abate; at length the patient becomes convulsed and comatose,
from which state very few recover. Tanquerel, who is
unnecessarily minute in subdividing the various affections produced
by the poison of lead, distinguishes four kinds of affections of the
head, coma, epilepsy, delirium, and a combination of all these.<a id='r1327' /><a href='#f1327' class='c013'><sup>[1327]</sup></a> A
very rare termination allied to that now described is sudden death
during the colic stage, without any symptom which would lead one to
suspect its approach. A case of this kind has been related by M.
Louis. His patient, five minutes after talking to the attendant of his
ward, was found at his bedside in the agony of death; and no cause
for so sudden a death could be found on dissection.<a id='r1328' /><a href='#f1328' class='c013'><sup>[1328]</sup></a> Somewhat similar
was a case which occurred in 1838 at the hospital of La Charité
at Paris. A man labouring for three days severely under the colic
stage of the disease, began to breathe stertorously soon after straining
at stool, and died in three hours.<a id='r1329' /><a href='#f1329' class='c013'><sup>[1329]</sup></a> In a case which occurred to Dr.
Elliotson death was owing to concomitant perforation of the stomach,
a concurrence which was probably accidental, but which was also
once observed by Dr. Copland.<a id='r1330' /><a href='#f1330' class='c013'><sup>[1330]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In cases, on the other hand, which have not been neglected, and
particularly when the attack is not the first, the departure of the colic
often leaves the patient in a state of extreme debility, which by and
by is found to be a true partial palsy, more or less complete. This
affection is sometimes present before the colic departs, but is apt to
escape notice till the pain abates. Occasionally it supervenes on a
sudden, but more generally it is preceded by a sense of weariness,
numbness and tremor of the parts. The palsy is of a peculiar kind.
It affects chiefly the upper extremities, and is attended with excessive
muscular emaciation. The loss of power and substance is most remarkable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>in the muscles which supply the thumb and fingers; and in
every case which I have seen the extensors suffered more than the flexors.
The paralysis is hardly ever complete, except perhaps in the extensors
of the fingers. When it is considerable, the position of the hands is
almost characteristic of the disease. The hands are constantly bent,
except when the arms hang straight down by the side; they dangle
loosely when the patient moves; he cannot extend them, and
raises one arm with the aid of the other. The palsy is attended, according
to Tanquerel, with diminished heat in the parts, and feeble
pulsation in the arteries which supply them. There is seldom any
loss of sensation in the affected parts. But the paralysis sometimes
affects the nerves of the other senses. Thus two cases of paralysis
of the nerves of vision have been related by Dr. Alderson of
Hull;<a id='r1331' /><a href='#f1331' class='c013'><sup>[1331]</sup></a> and Tanquerel says this affection is not uncommon in Paris,
and is attended with dilated and immovable pupils. The latter
author also once met with deafness in the same circumstances.—Patients
affected with lead palsy usually complain of racking pains in
the limbs and arms, digestion is feeble, and trivial causes renew the
colic. From this deplorable condition it is still possible to restore
the sufferer to health, chiefly by rigorous attention to regimen. But
he too often dies in consequence of a fresh attack of colic as soon as
he returns to his fatal trade.</p>

<p class='c006'>The lead palsy, however, does not always come on in this regular
manner. Sometimes the primary stage of colic is wanting, so that
the wasting of the muscles and loss of power are the first symptoms.
I have seen a characteristic example of the kind in a sailor who had
been employed for a month in painting a vessel. He had great
weakness and wasting of the arms and hands, particularly of the ball
of the thumb; but except a tendency to indigestion, costiveness, and
transient slight pain of the belly, he had suffered no previous disorder
of the intestines. I have seen the paralytic affection confined to
the extensors of one hand in a compositor, and Dr. Chowne met with
a similar affection of both hands in a gas-fitter.<a id='r1332' /><a href='#f1332' class='c013'><sup>[1332]</sup></a> Dr. Bright observed
palsy without colic in the case of a painter three times in the course
of seven years.<a id='r1333' /><a href='#f1333' class='c013'><sup>[1333]</sup></a>—In like manner, according to Tanquerel, the neuralgic
affection may occur severely without any precursory colic;
and the same author has witnessed both coma and convulsions in the
same circumstances.</p>

<p class='c006'>Colica pictonum, with the collateral disorders specified above, is
the only disease which has been distinctly traced to the operation of lead
insidiously introduced into the body. But many other disorders have
been ascribed to its agency. Boerhaave seems to have imagined that
consumption might be so induced; and Dr. Lambe thought that to
this cause may be traced the increased prevalence of “scrofula,
phthisis, dropsy, chronic rheumatism, stomach complaints, hypochondriasis,
and the host of nervous complaints which infest modern
life.”<a id='r1334' /><a href='#f1334' class='c013'><sup>[1334]</sup></a> These conjectures are wholly destitute of foundation in fact.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>In whatever form lead is habitually applied to the body, it is apt to
bring on the train of symptoms mentioned above;—the inhalation of
its fumes, the habitual contact of any of its compounds with the skin,
the prolonged use of them internally as medicines, or externally as
unguents and lotions, and the accidental introduction of them for a
length of time with the food, may sooner or later equally induce
colica pictonum.</p>

<p class='c006'>Instances have occurred of colic being produced by the prolonged
employment of the compounds of lead inwardly in medical practice.
Such cases are so uncommon that it is evident some strong constitutional
tendency must co-operate. But it is in vain to deny, as some
do, that the medicinal employment of preparations of lead internally
is unattended with any risk whatever of slow poisoning. Dr. Billing
of Mulhausen relates a case of death, apparently from the
comatose affection succeeding the colic stage of poisoning with lead,
in the instance of a boy of fifteen, to whom he gave acetate of lead
in gradually increasing doses for six weeks, till he took two grains
daily.<a id='r1335' /><a href='#f1335' class='c013'><sup>[1335]</sup></a> Tanquerel met with a case of colic produced by 130 grains
taken in fourteen days, and another occasioned by 149 grains in
sixteen days.<a id='r1336' /><a href='#f1336' class='c013'><sup>[1336]</sup></a> Sir George Baker has mentioned similar instances.<a id='r1337' /><a href='#f1337' class='c013'><sup>[1337]</sup></a>
It would even appear that metallic lead may have the same effect
when taken inwardly. Thus Dr. Ruva of Cilavegno has related
the case of a man who was violently attacked with the colic form of
the effects of lead after taking six ounces of shot by direction of a
quack for the cure of dyspepsia, and was seized again with the same
symptoms six days afterwards on taking four ounces more. On the
second occasion he had violent colic, great feebleness of the limbs,
constant vomiting of any thing he swallowed, severe headache, and
other analogous symptoms, of which he was not effectually cured
for seven weeks.<a id='r1338' /><a href='#f1338' class='c013'><sup>[1338]</sup></a> A case somewhat similar, but less severe, has been
described by Dr. Bruce.<a id='r1339' /><a href='#f1339' class='c013'><sup>[1339]</sup></a>—With regard to lead colic being excited by
unguents and lotions applied to the surface of the body, Sir George
Baker mentions a case of violent colic brought on by litharge ointment
applied to the vagina; he adds that children have been thrown
into convulsions by the same substance sprinkled on sores: and he
quotes Zeller for a case where symptoms of poisoning were occasioned
by sprinkling the axilla with it, as a cure for redness of the
face.<a id='r1340' /><a href='#f1340' class='c013'><sup>[1340]</sup></a> Dr. Wall, in a letter to the preceding author, mentions his
having seen the bowels affected by Goulard’s extract applied to
ulcers; in another paper he has given two unequivocal cases, in
one of which colic was brought on by saturnine lotions applied to
a pustular disease, and in the other by immersing the legs twice
a day for ten days in a bath of the solution of acetate of lead:<a id='r1341' /><a href='#f1341' class='c013'><sup>[1341]</sup></a>
and lately Dr. Taufflieb of Barr observed lead colic to arise from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>the continued use of diachylon plaster during eleven weeks for
dressing an extensive ulcer.<a id='r1342' /><a href='#f1342' class='c013'><sup>[1342]</sup></a> Such accidents are exceedingly rare,
and some auxiliary cause must have favoured the operation of the
poison in the cases now noticed; for every one knows that free
use is made of lead unguents and lotions, yet we seldom hear of
any bad consequences.—These cases, however, will probably remove
the doubts which some entertain of the possibility of lead
colic being induced by the application of the compounds of lead
to the sound skin in those trades which compel the workmen to
be constantly handling them. At the same time it must be admitted,
that in all these trades there exists a more obvious and
ready channel for the introduction of the poison; because the
workmen are either exposed to breathe its fumes, or are apt to
transfer its particles from the fingers into the stomach with their
food.—Of all exposures none is more rapid and certain than breathing
the vapours or dust of the preparations of lead. But for that
very reason workmen who are so exposed seldom suffer; because
the greatness of the risk has led to the discovery of means to avert
it, and the openness of the danger renders it easy for the workmen
to apply them. Tanquerel mentions a singular case of a woman
who was attacked in consequence of the fine dust of white lead
ascending through chinks in the floor from a room below, where a
perfumer was in the practice of grinding and sifting that substance.<a id='r1343' /><a href='#f1343' class='c013'><sup>[1343]</sup></a>—It
may be added that Dr. Otto of Copenhagen has published an
extraordinary instance of fatal lead-colic, originating in the habitual
use of Macuba snuff adulterated with twenty per cent. of red lead.<a id='r1344' /><a href='#f1344' class='c013'><sup>[1344]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>To these observations on the various ways in which lead insidiously
enters the system a few remarks may be added on the trades
which expose workmen to its influence. The most accurate information
on this subject is contained in the work of Mérat.</p>

<p class='c006'>He places foremost in the list miners of lead. In this country
miners are now rarely affected, because the frequency of colica pictonum
among them formerly led their masters to study the subject,
and to employ proper precautions for removing the danger. It has
been stated by Dr. Percival, and is generally thought, that the whole
workmen in lead mines are apt to be attacked with the colic,—those
who dig the sulphuret as well as those who roast the ore.<a id='r1345' /><a href='#f1345' class='c013'><sup>[1345]</sup></a>
If this idea were correct, it would be in contradiction with the
general principle in toxicology, that the metals are not poisonous
unless oxidated. But the opinion is in all probability founded
on error; for, according to information communicated to me by
Mr. Braid, and confirmed since by personal investigation, the workmen
at Leadhills who dig and pulverize the ore, although liable to
various diseases connected with their profession, and particularly
to pectoral complaints, never have lead colic till they also work at
the smelting furnaces.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>Next to miners may be ranked manufacturers of litharge, red-lead
and white-lead. The workmen at these manufactories are exposed
to inhale the fumes from the furnaces or the dust from the pulverizing
mills. It has been chiefly among the workmen of a former white-lead
manufactory in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh that I have
had an opportunity of witnessing the lead colic. By a simple
change the proprietor made in the process, and which will be
mentioned presently, the disease was almost extirpated some years
before the manufactory was given up.</p>

<p class='c006'>Next in order, perhaps in the same class with colour-makers, are
house-painters. The causes of their liability is the great quantity of
the preparations of lead contained in the paints they use. It would
appear that lead colic is most frequent among people of that trade
in cities of the largest size. In Geneva, as I am informed by my
friend Dr. C. Coindet of that place, colica pictonum is now almost
unknown and never occurs among painters. In Edinburgh it is also
little known among painters. A journeyman painter, a patient of
mine in the Infirmary, had been seventeen years in the trade, and
yet did not know what the painters’ colic or lead palsy meant. In
London, according to the Dispensary reports, and in Paris, according
to the tables of Mérat, many workmen of that trade suffer. I have
been informed by an intelligent workman, once a patient of mine,
who had been a journeyman painter both in London and Edinburgh,
that the number of his acquaintances who had been affected
with colic in the metropolis was incomparably greater than here.
This man ascribed the difference to the working hours being more
in the former place, so that the men had not leisure enough to
make it worth their while to clean themselves carefully in the intervals.
This appears a rational explanation. I do not know how
the great prevalence of colic among painters in Paris is to be accounted
for.</p>

<p class='c006'>Plumbers, sheet-lead manufacturers, and lead-pipe makers, are also
for obvious reasons apt to suffer; but as they are not necessarily exposed
to the vapours of lead, and suffer only in consequence of handling
it in the metallic form, it ought to be an easy matter to protect
them. They themselves conceive that a very hazardous part of
their occupation is the removing the melted lead from the melting pot,
to make the sheets or pipes; but this operation cannot be dangerous
if the melting pots are properly constructed.</p>

<p class='c006'>A few cases of lead colic occur among glass-blowers, glaziers, and
potters, who use the oxide of lead in their respective trades.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are a few also among lapidaries and others, who use it for
grinding and polishing, and among grocers and colourmen who sell
its various preparations. Printers seldom suffer from the colic, but
are generally thought liable to partial palsy of the hands, which is ascribed
to frequent handling of the types. I have met with one case
apparently of this nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lead is not the only metal to which the power of inducing colica
pictonum has been ascribed. Mérat has mentioned several instances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>of the disease occurring among brass-founders and other artizans who
work with copper.<a id='r1346' /><a href='#f1346' class='c013'><sup>[1346]</sup></a> Tronchin quotes Scheuchzer for a set of well-marked
cases in a convent of monks, where the malady was supposed
to have been traced to all the utensils for preparing and keeping their
food having been made of untinned copper.<a id='r1347' /><a href='#f1347' class='c013'><sup>[1347]</sup></a> The same author mentions
two cases, one of which came under his immediate notice, where
the apparent cause was the long-continued use of antimonial preparations
internally.<a id='r1348' /><a href='#f1348' class='c013'><sup>[1348]</sup></a> Mérat likewise found a few iron-smiths and white-iron-smiths
in the lists kept at one of the Parisian hospitals.<a id='r1349' /><a href='#f1349' class='c013'><sup>[1349]</sup></a> Chevallier
alleges that colic occurs at times among money-changers at
Paris, and others who constantly handle silver.<a id='r1350' /><a href='#f1350' class='c013'><sup>[1350]</sup></a> Cases have even
been noticed by Mérat among varnishers, plasterers, quarrymen, stone-hewers,
marble-workers, statuaries, saltpetre-makers;<a id='r1351' /><a href='#f1351' class='c013'><sup>[1351]</sup></a> and Tronchin
enumerates among its causes the immoderate use of acid wine or
of cider, checked perspiration, sea-scurvy, and melancholy. But the
only substance besides lead, whose operation in producing colica
pictonum has been traced with any degree of probability, is copper;
and even among artizans who work with copper the disease is very
rare. As to the other tradesmen mentioned by Mérat, it is so very
uncommon among them, that we may safely impute it, when it does
occur, to some other agent besides what the trade of the individual
exposes him to; and in general the secret introduction of lead into
the body may be presumed to be the real cause. Still, however, the
connection of colica pictonum with other causes besides the poison of
lead is upheld by so many facts, and is believed by so many authorities,
that this disease cannot be safely assumed, even in its most characteristic
form, as supplying undoubted evidence of the introduction
of lead into the system. Dr. Burton thinks it will when the blue line
at the edge of the gums is seen.</p>

<p class='c006'>The work of Mérat contains some interesting numerical documents,
illustrative of the trades which expose artisans to colica pictonum.
They are derived from the lists kept at the hospital of La Charité in
Paris, during the years 1776 and 1811. The total number of cases
of colica pictonum in both years was 279. Of these, 241 were artisans
whose trades exposed them to the poison of lead, namely, 148
painters, 28 plumbers, 16 potters, 15 porcelain-makers, 12 lapidaries,
9 colour-grinders, 3 glass-blowers, 2 glaziers, 2 toy-men, 2 shoemakers,
a printer, a lead-miner, a leaf-beater, a shot-manufacturer. Of
the remainder, 17 belonged to trades in which they were exposed to
copper, namely, 7 button-makers, 5 brass-founders, 4 braziers, and a copper-turner.
The remaining twenty-one were tradesmen, who worked
little, or not at all with either metal, namely, 4 varnishers, 2 gilders,
2 locksmiths, a hatter, a saltpetre-maker, a winegrocer, a vine-dresser,
a labourer, a distiller, a stone-cutter, a calciner,<a id='r1352' /><a href='#f1352' class='c013'><sup>[1352]</sup></a> a soldier, a house-servant,
a waiter, and an attorney’s clerk.—Age or youth seems not
to afford any protection against the poison. Of the 279 cases, 24
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>were under twenty, and among these were several painter-boys not
above fifteen years old; 113 were between nineteen and thirty; 66
between twenty-nine and forty; 38 between thirty-nine and fifty; 28
between forty-nine and sixty; and 10 older than sixty. These proportions
correspond pretty nearly with the relative number of workmen
of similar ages.—Among the 279 cases fifteen died, or 5·4 per
cent.</p>

<p class='c006'>There seems to have lately been little or no diminution in the frequency
of the disease in Paris. In 1833–4–5–6, there were treated in
the hospitals 1541 cases, or 385 annually; of whom one in 39½ died.
And in 1839–40–41 there were 761 cases, or 252 annually; of whom
one in 24½ died. Of 302 cases in 1841 no fewer then 266 were from
white-lead manufactories.<a id='r1353' /><a href='#f1353' class='c013'><sup>[1353]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> III.—<i>Of the Morbid Appearances caused by Lead.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The morbid appearances caused by poisoning with lead are in some
respects peculiar.</p>

<p class='c006'>In acute poisoning, from the irritant action of its soluble salts, as
in the case of the drummer poisoned by Goulard’s extract, the lower
end of the gullet, the whole stomach and duodenum, part of the
jejunum, and the ascending and transverse colon, have been found
much inflamed, and the villous coat of the stomach as if macerated.
In Mr. Taylor’s two cases Dr. Bird found the villous coat of the stomach
gray, but otherwise natural; and the intestines were much contracted.</p>

<p class='c006'>The stomach in the first of these cases contained a reddish-brown,
sweetish, styptic fluid, in which lead was detected by chemical analysis,<a id='r1354' /><a href='#f1354' class='c013'><sup>[1354]</sup></a>—an
important medico-legal fact, since the man survived
nearly three days. Some valuable observations have been made by
Professor Orfila as to the presence of lead in the textures of the stomach
in such instances. When small doses of acetate or nitrate of
lead were administered to dogs and allowed to act for two hours
only, the villous coat presented numerous streaks of white points,
which contained lead, as hydrosulphuric acid blackened them. These
points, though less distinct, were still visible, when the animals were
allowed to live four days after the excess of salt had been removed;
and even after seventeen days, although no such appearance remained,
lead could still be detected in the tissues of the stomach.<a id='r1355' /><a href='#f1355' class='c013'><sup>[1355]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The blood in animals is sometimes altered. Dr. Campbell found
it fluid. In a dog poisoned with litharge, the experimentalists of
the Veterinary School at Lyons found it of a vermilion colour in the
veins, and brighter than usual in the arteries.<a id='r1356' /><a href='#f1356' class='c013'><sup>[1356]</sup></a> Mitscherlich also found
it unusually red and firmly coagulated.<a id='r1357' /><a href='#f1357' class='c013'><sup>[1357]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The appearances in the bodies of those who have died of the various
forms of lead colic are different, and wholly unconnected with
inflammation.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>The valuable work of Mérat contains four inspections after death
from the acute or comatose form of colica pictonum. The bodies
were plump, muscular and fat. The alimentary canal was quite
empty, and the colon much contracted,—in one to an extraordinary
degree. The mucous coat of the alimentary canal was everywhere
healthy. He therefore infers that the disease is an affection of the
muscular coat only. It is a striking circumstance, and conformable
with what will be afterwards established in regard to the true narcotics,
that although both of the men died convulsed and comatose,
no morbid appearance was visible within the head.<a id='r1358' /><a href='#f1358' class='c013'><sup>[1358]</sup></a> Another case,
which confirms the foregoing facts, has been described by Mr. Deering.
It was that of a lady who died convulsed after suffering in the
usual manner, and in whose body no trace of disease could be detected
any where.<a id='r1359' /><a href='#f1359' class='c013'><sup>[1359]</sup></a> Senac informed Tronchin that he had dissected
above fifty cases of colica pictonum, and found no morbid appearances.<a id='r1360' /><a href='#f1360' class='c013'><sup>[1360]</sup></a>
Schloepfer’s observations on animals are to the same effect.
In rabbits which died of colica pictonum the great intestines were
excessively contracted, but all the other organs of the body were
healthy except the liver, which was dark and brittle.<a id='r1361' /><a href='#f1361' class='c013'><sup>[1361]</sup></a> Mitscherlich observed
in his animals extravasation of blood into the intestines, also
sometimes into the cavities of the pleura and peritoneum, and occasionally
under the peritoneal covering of the kidneys.<a id='r1362' /><a href='#f1362' class='c013'><sup>[1362]</sup></a> The only
instance I have met with where morbid appearances were found
within the head, was in a case mentioned by Sir G. Baker, of a gentleman
who died apoplectic after many attacks of colica pictonum,
and in whom the brain was found unusually soft, and blood extravasated
on its surface to the amount of an ounce.<a id='r1363' /><a href='#f1363' class='c013'><sup>[1363]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The appearances in those who have been long affected with the
paralytic form of colica pictonum have been rarely observed in modern
times. I am indebted to my late colleague, Dr. Duncan, Junior,
for an account of the appearances in the intestinal canal of a plumber,
who had been long and frequently afflicted with colica pictonum and
its sequelæ. The intestines were dark, tender, and far advanced in
putrefaction. The cardiac orifice of the stomach was so narrow that
it would admit a goose-quill. The mesenteric glands were enlarged
and hardened. The thoracic duct was surrounded by many large
bodies like diseased glands, exactly of the colour of lead, and composed
of organized cysts containing apparently an inorganic matter.
The analysis of this matter was unfortunately neglected. The muscles
in similar circumstances are much diseased. When the paralysis
is not of long standing, it appears from the experiments of
Schloepfer (whose animals survived about three weeks), that the
whole muscular system becomes pale, bloodless, and flaccid. When
the palsy is of long standing, this change increases so much, that
the muscles in some parts, as in the arms and thumbs, acquire the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>colour and general aspect of white fibrous tissue. Some observations
on the nature of these changes will be found in the essays of
Sir G. Baker.<a id='r1364' /><a href='#f1364' class='c013'><sup>[1364]</sup></a> The facts are communicated by Mr. John Hunter.
On examining the muscles of the arm and hand of a house-painter
who was killed by an accident, Mr. Hunter found them all of a cream
colour, and very opaque, their fibres distinct, and their texture unusually
dry and tough. These alterations he at first imagined might
have been the result merely of the palsy and consequent inactivity
of the muscles, but on finding the same alterations produced by the
direct action of sugar of lead on muscle, he inferred that the poison
gradually effected a change either on the muscles directly, or on the
blood which supplied them.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a late elaborate inquiry into the pathology of lead-colic, M.
Tanquerel has arrived at the conclusion, that “the pathological
phenomena are not caused by anatomical changes cognisable by the
senses,” and that such appearances as may be found are the effects,
not the cause, of the disease.<a id='r1365' /><a href='#f1365' class='c013'><sup>[1365]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> IV.—<i>Of the Treatment of Poisoning with Lead.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The treatment of poisoning with lead, and the mode of protecting
workmen from its influence, will now require a few remarks.</p>

<p class='c006'>For the irritant form of poisoning, a safe and effectual antidote
exists in any of the soluble alkaline or earthy sulphates. If none of
these be at hand, then the alkaline carbonates may be given, particularly
the bicarbonates, which are not so irritating as the carbonates.
The phosphate of soda is also an excellent antidote. If the
patient does not vomit, it will be right also to give an emetic of the
sulphate of zinc. In other respects, the treatment does not differ
from that of poisoning with the irritants generally.</p>

<p class='c006'>Colica pictonum is usually treated in this country with great success
by a practice much followed here in colic and diarrhœa of all
kinds,—the conjunction of purgatives with anodynes. A full dose
of a neutral laxative salt is given, and an hour afterwards a full dose
of opium. Sometimes alvine discharges take place before the opium
acts, more commonly not till its action is past, and occasionally not
for a considerable time afterwards. But the pain and vomiting subside,
the restlessness and irritability pass away, and the bowels return
nearly or entirely to their natural condition. Sometimes it is necessary
to repeat the practice. It is almost always successful. I have
seldom seen the second dose fail to remove the colic, leaving the
bowels at worst in a state of constipation. Dr. Alderson of Hull,
who has had many opportunities of treating the workmen of a white-lead
manufactory there, says powerful purgatives, such as croton-oil,
are highly serviceable in severe cases, and are borne well notwithstanding
the extreme debility often present.<a id='r1366' /><a href='#f1366' class='c013'><sup>[1366]</sup></a> M. Tanquerel
says he has found this treatment more effectual in Paris than any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>other means.<a id='r1367' /><a href='#f1367' class='c013'><sup>[1367]</sup></a> When the pulse is full and strong, I have seen venesection
premised with apparent advantage; in some instances it
appeared to me to be called for by the flushing of the face and the
violence of the spasms; and I have never seen it otherwise than a
safe remedy, notwithstanding the fears expressed by Dr. Warren and
others.<a id='r1368' /><a href='#f1368' class='c013'><sup>[1368]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The hospital of La Charité in Paris has long enjoyed a high reputation
for the treatment of this disease. In the first place a decoction
is given of half an ounce of senna in a pound of water, mixed with
half an ounce of sulphate of magnesia and four ounces of the wine of
antimony. Next day an ounce of sulphate of magnesia and three
grains of tartar-emetic are administered in two pounds of infusion of
cassia, to keep up the operation of the first laxative. In the evening
a clyster is given, containing twelve ounces of wine and half as much
oil. After this the patient is made to vomit with tartar-emetic, then
drenched with <i>ptisanes</i> for several days, and the treatment is wound
up with another dose of the first purgative succeeded by gentle anodynes.
I am not aware of any particular advantage possessed by
this complicated and tormenting method of cure, which is not equally
possessed by the simpler plan pursued in Britain.</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1831 M. Gendrin announced to the French Institute that he had
found sulphuric acid to be at once the most effectual remedy, and the
most certain preventive, for the injurious effects of lead; and he has
subsequently spoken in strong terms of the utility of this treatment.<a id='r1369' /><a href='#f1369' class='c013'><sup>[1369]</sup></a>
But the experience of others does not bear out his conclusions.<a id='r1370' /><a href='#f1370' class='c013'><sup>[1370]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Among the many other methods of cure that have been proposed
for the primary stage of this disease, salivation by mercury deserves
to be particularized. It appears to have been often used with success,
the colic yielding as soon as ptyalism sets in.<a id='r1371' /><a href='#f1371' class='c013'><sup>[1371]</sup></a> If the case,
however, is severe, there is no time to lose in waiting for the action
of the mercury to commence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The treatment in the advanced period of the disease, when palsy
is the chief symptom remaining, depends almost entirely on regimen.
The patient must for a time at least quit altogether his unlucky trade.
He should be allowed the most generous food he can digest. He
ought to take frequent gentle exercise in the open air, but never to
fatigue. The hands being the most severely injured of the affected
parts, and at the same time the most important to the workman, the
practitioner’s attention should be directed peculiarly to the restoration
of their muscular power. This appears to be most easily brought
about by frictions, electricity, and regulated exercise, the hands
being also supported in the intervals by splints extending from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>elbows to the fingers. The dragging of the emaciated muscles by
the weight of the dangling hands certainly seems to retard recovery.—Strychnia
has also been repeatedly found of service in restoring
muscular action. Tanquerel states that electricity and strychnia, but
especially the latter, have appeared to him by far the most efficacious
remedies both for muscular paralysis and for amaurosis.—In the
head affections the best treatment consists in relying on nature and
merely combating symptoms; and blood-letting is of no use, however
much it may seem to be indicated by the coma and convulsions.</p>

<p class='c006'>When a person has been once attacked with colica pictonum, he is
more easily attacked again. Hence if he is young enough, he should,
if possible, change his profession for one in which he is not brought
into proximity with lead. Few, however, have it in their power to
do so. The prophylaxis, therefore, or mode of preventing the influence
of the poison, becomes a subject of great importance; and
more particularly when we consider the vast number of workmen in
different trades, whose safety it is intended to secure.</p>

<p class='c006'>On this subject many useful instructions are laid down in the work
of Mérat. He very properly sets out with insisting on the utmost
regard being paid to cleanliness,—a point too much neglected by
most artizans, and particularly by those to whom it is most necessary,
the artizans who work with the metals. In proof of the importance
of this rule, he observes he knew a potter, who contracted the lead
colic early in life when he was accustomed to go about very dirty,
but for thirty years after had not any return of it, in consequence
simply of a scrupulous attention to cleanliness. In order to secure
due cleanliness three points should be attended to. In the first place,
the face and hands should be washed once a day at least, the mouth
well rinsed, and the hair occasionally combed. Secondly, frequent
bathing is of great consequence, both with a view to cleanliness and
as a general tonic; so that masters should provide their workmen
with sufficient means and opportunities for practising it. Lastly, the
working clothes should be made, not of woollen, but of strong, compact
linen, should be changed and washed at least once and still
better twice a week, and should be worn as little as possible out of
the workshop. While at work a cap of some light impervious material
should always be worn.</p>

<p class='c006'>Next to cleanliness, the most important article of the prophylaxis
relates to the means for preventing the food being impregnated with
lead. For this end it is essential that the workmen never take their
meals in the workshop, and that before eating they wash their lips
and hands with soap and water, and brush out all particles of dirt
from the nails. It is also of moment that they breakfast before going
to work in the morning.</p>

<p class='c006'>Derangements of the digestive organs should be watched with
great care. If they appear to arise from the poison of lead, the individual
should leave off work with the very first symptom, and take
a laxative. Habitual constipation should be provided against.</p>

<p class='c006'>The nature of the diet of the workmen is of some consequence. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>should be as far as possible of a nutritive and digestible kind. Mérat
condemns in strong terms the small tart wines generally used by the
lower ranks of his countrymen. They constitute a very poor drink
for all artizans; and are peculiarly ill adapted for those who work with
lead, because, besides being at times themselves adulterated with that
poison, they are also apt to disorder the bowels by their acidity. Beer
is infinitely preferable. Various articles of diet have been recommended
as tending to impede the operation of the poison. Hoffmann recommends
brandy, the efficacy of which few workmen will dispute. There
is some reason for believing that the free use of fat and fatty articles
of food is a preservative. Dehaen was informed by the proprietor and
the physician of a lead mine in Styria, that the work-people were once
very liable to colic and palsy, but that, after being told by a quack
doctor to eat a good deal of fat, especially at breakfast, they were
exempt for three years.<a id='r1372' /><a href='#f1372' class='c013'><sup>[1372]</sup></a> Another fact of the kind was communicated
to Sir George Baker by a physician at Osterhoüt, near Breda. The
village contained a great number of potters, among whom he did not
witness a single case of lead colic in the course of fifteen years; and
he attributes their immunity to their having lived much on cheese,
butter, bacon, and other fatty kinds of food.<a id='r1373' /><a href='#f1373' class='c013'><sup>[1373]</sup></a> Mr. Wilson says, in
his account of the colic at Leadhills in Lanarkshire, that English
workmen, who live much on fat meat, suffer less than Scotchmen,
who do not.<a id='r1374' /><a href='#f1374' class='c013'><sup>[1374]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Professor Liebig says that lead colic is unknown in all white-lead
manufactories, where the workmen use as a beverage lemonade or
sugar-water acidulated with sulphuric acid; and it was stated above
that the same announcement has been made by Mr. Gendrin. This,
however, is doubtful. The prophylactic effects of sulphuric acid have
been denied in France by M. Tanquerel,<a id='r1375' /><a href='#f1375' class='c013'><sup>[1375]</sup></a> and M. Grisolle;<a id='r1376' /><a href='#f1376' class='c013'><sup>[1376]</sup></a> the latter
of whom in particular says that no advantage whatever was derived
from it at the white-lead manufactory of Clichy near Paris.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some have likewise proposed as an additional preservative, that
the exposed parts of the body should be anointed with oily or fatty
matters. But Mérat maintains with some reason, that the lead will
be thereby enabled to penetrate the cuticle more easily by friction and
pressure.</p>

<p class='c006'>The observance of the preceding rules will depend of course in a great
measure on the intelligence and docility of the workmen. It would
appear that particular care should be taken in hot weather, statistical
facts having shown that three times as many workmen are attacked in
Paris during the month of January as in July.<a id='r1377' /><a href='#f1377' class='c013'><sup>[1377]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Some other objects of much consequence are to be attained by the
humanity and skill of the masters.</p>

<p class='c006'>The workshop should be spacious, and both thoroughly and systematically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>ventilated, the external air being freely admitted when
the weather will allow, and particular currents being established, by
which floating particles are carried away in certain invariable and
known courses. Miners and others who work at furnaces in which
lead is smelted, fused, or oxidated, should be protected by a strong
draught through the furnaces. According to Mr. Braid, wherever
furnaces of such a construction were built at Leadhills, the colic disappeared;
while it continued to recur where the furnaces were of the
old, low-chimneyed form. Manufacturers of litharge and red-lead
used formerly to suffer much in consequence of the furnaces being so
constructed as to compel them to inhale the fine dust of the oxides.
In drawing the furnaces the hot material is raked out upon the floor,
which is two or three feet below the aperture in the furnace; and the
finer particles are therefore driven up and diffused through the apartment.
But this obvious danger is now completely averted by a subsidiary
chimney, which rises in front of the drawing aperture, and
through which a strong current of air is attracted from the apartment,
the hot material on the ground performing the part of a fire.</p>

<p class='c006'>In white-lead manufactories a very important and simple improvement
has been effected of late in some places by abandoning the
practice of dry-grinding. In all manufactories of the kind, the ultimate
pulverizing of the white lead has been long performed under
water. But in general the preparatory process of rolling, by which
the carbonate is separated from the sheets of lead on which it is formed,
continues to be executed dry. This is a very dangerous operation,
because the workmen must inhale a great deal of the fine dust of the
carbonate. In a white-lead manufactory which formerly existed at
Portobello, the process was entirely performed under water or with
damping; and to this precaution in a great measure was imputed the
improvement effected by the proprietor in the health of the workmen,
and their superior immunity from disease over those of Hull and other
places, where the same precaution was not taken at that time. The only
operation latterly considered dangerous at the Portobello works was
the emptying of the drying stove, and the packing of the white lead
in barrels; and the dust diffused in that process was kept down as
much as possible by the floor being maintained constantly damp. By
these precautions, by making the workmen wash their hands and faces
before leaving the works for their meals, and by administering a brisk
dose of castor oil on the first appearance of any complaint of the
stomach or bowels, the manufacturer succeeded in extirpating colica
pictonum entirely for several years.—This trade continues to be a
very pernicious one in France; for no fewer than 266 cases of colic
were admitted into the Parisian hospitals in 1841 from the white-lead
manufactories in and near the capital. Yet facts are not wanting there
to prove that with proper care the disease may be all but extirpated.
A French manufacturer, whose workmen at one time suffered severely,
had no case of colic among them for nine years after breaking them
in to the observance of due precautions.<a id='r1378' /><a href='#f1378' class='c013'><sup>[1378]</sup></a> Another says, from his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>own experience and information obtained at other works, he is satisfied
the risk is very much greater among the intemperate than among
sober workmen.<a id='r1379' /><a href='#f1379' class='c013'><sup>[1379]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING WITH BARYTA.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>Baryta and its salts, the last genus of the metallic irritants which
requires particular notice, are commonly arranged among earthy substances,
but on account of their chemical and physiological properties,
may be correctly considered in the present place. These poisons
are worthy of notice, because they are not only energetic, but likewise
easily procured, so that they may be more extensively used,
when more generally known.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> I.—<i>Of the Chemical Tests for the preparations of Baryta.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Three compounds of this substance may be mentioned, the pure
earth or oxide, the muriate, or chloride of barium, and the carbonate.
The pure earth, however, is so little seen, that it is unnecessary
to describe its chemical or physiological properties.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>Carbonate of Baryta</i> is met with in two states. Sometimes it
is native, and then commonly occurs in radiated crystalline masses,
of different degrees of coarseness of fibre, nearly colourless, very
heavy, and effervescing with diluted muriatic acid. It is also sold
in the shops in the form of a fine powder of a white colour, prepared
artificially by precipitating a soluble salt of baryta with an alkaline
carbonate. It is best known by its colour, insolubility in water,
solubility with effervescence in muriatic acid, and the properties of
the resulting muriate of baryta.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>Muriate of Baryta</i>, or chloride of barium, is the most common
of the compounds of this earth, having been for some time used
in medicine for scrofulous and other constitutional disorders. It is
procured either by evaporating the solution of the carbonate in hydrochloric
acid, or by decomposing a more common mineral, the sulphate,
by means of charcoal aided by heat, dissolving in boiling
water the sulphuret so formed, and decomposing this sulphuret by
hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is commonly met with in the shops irregularly crystallized in
tables. It has an acrid, irritating taste, is permanent in the air, and
dissolves in two parts and a half of temperate water.</p>

<p class='c006'>The solution is distinguished from other substances by the following
chemical characters. From all other metallic poisons hitherto mentioned,
it is easily distinguished by means of hydrosulphuric acid,
which does not cause any change in barytic solutions. From the
alkaline and magnesian salts it is distinguished by the effects of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>alkaline sulphates, which have no visible action except on the barytic
solution, and cause in it a heavy white precipitate, insoluble in
nitric acid. From the chlorides of calcium and strontium, it is to be
distinguished by evaporating the solution till it crystallizes. The
crystals are known not to be chloride of calcium, because they are
not deliquescent. The chloride of strontium (which resembles that
of barium in many properties, but which must be carefully distinguished,
as it is not poisonous), differs in the form of the crystals,
which are delicate six-sided prisms, while those of the barytic salt
are four-sided tables, often truncated on two opposite angles, sometimes
on all four,—by its solubility in alcohol, which does not take up
the chloride of barium,—and by its effect on the flame of alcohol,
which it colours rose-red, while the barytic salts colour it yellow.
The chloride of barium is known from other soluble barytic salts,
by the action of nitrate of silver, which throws down a white precipitate.</p>

<p class='c006'>Vegetable and animal fluids do not decompose the solution of
chloride of barium, except by reason of the sulphates and carbonates
which most of them contain in small quantities. But the action of
its tests may be distinguished, although the salt has not undergone decomposition.
In that case the most convenient method of analysis is to
add a little nitric acid, which will dissolve any carbonate of baryta
that may have been formed,—to filter and then throw down the
whole baryta in the form of sulphate, by means of the sulphate of
soda,—and to collect the precipitate, and calcine it with charcoal for
half an hour in a platinum spoon or earthen crucible, according to the
quantity. A sulphuret of baryta will thus be procured, which is to be
dissolved out by boiling water, and decomposed after filtration by muriatic
acid. A pure solution is thus easily obtained. Orfila has lately
proposed a process more complex in its details, but the same in principle.<a id='r1380' /><a href='#f1380' class='c013'><sup>[1380]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> II.—<i>Of the Action of the Salts of Baryta, and the Symptoms they excite in Man.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The action of the barytic salts on the body is energetic. Like
most metallic poisons, they seem to possess a twofold action,—one
local and irritating, the other remote and indicated by narcotic symptoms.
This narcotic action is more decided and invariable than in
the instance of any of the metallic poisons hitherto noticed. Such
at least is the result of the experiments of Sir B. Brodie,<a id='r1381' /><a href='#f1381' class='c013'><sup>[1381]</sup></a> which have
since been amply confirmed by Professor Orfila<a id='r1382' /><a href='#f1382' class='c013'><sup>[1382]</sup></a> and Professor
Gmelin.<a id='r1383' /><a href='#f1383' class='c013'><sup>[1383]</sup></a> Orfila found that when the chloride was injected into the
veins of a dog in the dose of five grains only, death ensued in six
minutes, and was preceded by convulsions, at first partial, but afterwards
affecting the whole body. Sir B. Brodie found the same
effects follow in twenty minutes, when ten grains were applied to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>wound in the back of a rabbit,—the convulsions being preceded by
palsy, and ending in coma. Half an ounce when injected into the
stomach excited the same symptoms in a cat, and proved fatal in
sixty-five minutes, though the animal vomited. Schloepfer observed,
that when a scruple, dissolved in two drachms of water, was injected
into the windpipe of a rabbit, it fell down immediately, threw back
its head, was convulsed in the fore-legs, and died in twelve minutes.<a id='r1384' /><a href='#f1384' class='c013'><sup>[1384]</sup></a>
Gmelin observed in his experiments that it caused slight inflammation
of the stomach, and strong symptoms of an action on the brain,
spine, and voluntary muscles. He found the voluntary muscles destitute
of contractility immediately after death; yet the heart continued to contract
vigorously for some time, even without the application of any stimulus.
From some experiments made on horses by Huzard and Biron, by
order of the Société de Santé of Paris, it appears that the hydrochlorate,
when given to these animals in the dose of two drachms daily, produced
sudden death about the fifteenth day, without previous symptoms of
any consequence.<a id='r1385' /><a href='#f1385' class='c013'><sup>[1385]</sup></a> In the experiments now related, very little appearance
of inflammation was found in the parts to which the poison
was directly applied. It is also worthy of remark that the heart does
not seem to have been particularly affected; and yet according to the
recent researches of Mr. Blake, the barytic salts are the most powerful
of all inorganic poisons in their action on the heart, when they
are injected into the veins. A quarter of a grain of the chloride appreciably
depresses arterial action; two grains completely arrest the
heart’s contractions in twelve seconds; and when it is injected back
into the aorta from the axillary artery, it causes at first some obstruction
to the capillary circulation, but soon arrests the action of the
heart, as when it is introduced into the veins.<a id='r1386' /><a href='#f1386' class='c013'><sup>[1386]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The pure earth appears to produce nearly the same effects in an
inferior dose. When swallowed, the symptoms of local irritation
are more violent; but death ensues in a very short space of time, and
is preceded by convulsions and insensibility. The stomach after
death is found of a reddish-black colour, and frequently with spots of
extravasated blood in its villous coat.</p>

<p class='c006'>The carbonate in a state of minute division is scarcely less active
than the hydrochlorate, since it is dissolved by the acid juices of the
stomach. A drachm killed a dog in six hours; vomiting, expressions
of pain, and an approach to insensibility preceded death; and
marks of inflammation were found in the stomach.<a id='r1387' /><a href='#f1387' class='c013'><sup>[1387]</sup></a> Pelletier made
many experiments on the poisonous properties of the carbonate.
Fifteen grains of the native carbonate killed one dog in eight hours,
and another in fifteen.<a id='r1388' /><a href='#f1388' class='c013'><sup>[1388]</sup></a> Dr. Campbell found it to be a dangerous
poison, even when applied externally. Twelve grains introduced
into a wound in the neck of a cat, excited on the third day languor,
slow respiration, and feeble pulse; towards evening the animal became
affected with convulsions of the hind-legs and with dilated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>pupils; and death followed not long afterwards.<a id='r1389' /><a href='#f1389' class='c013'><sup>[1389]</sup></a> This substance,
before its real nature was known, used at one time to be employed
in some parts of England as a variety of arsenic for poisoning rats.</p>

<p class='c006'>The salts of baryta are absorbed in the course of their action. The
chloride has been detected by Dr. Kramer both in the blood and
urine by incineration with carbonate of potash, washing the ashes
with weak solution of carbonate of potash, dissolving the residue in
diluted nitric acid, and testing the solution for baryta.<a id='r1390' /><a href='#f1390' class='c013'><sup>[1390]</sup></a> Orfila has also
obtained baryta, by his process alluded to above, in the liver, kidneys,
and spleen of animals killed by the chloride.<a id='r1391' /><a href='#f1391' class='c013'><sup>[1391]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The symptoms produced by the salts of baryta in man have seldom
been particularly described. An instance is shortly noticed in the
Journal of Science, where an ounce of the hydrochlorate was taken
by mistake for Glauber’s salt, and proved fatal. The patient immediately
after swallowing it felt a sense of burning in the stomach;
vomiting, convulsions, headache, and deafness ensued; and death
took place within an hour.<a id='r1392' /><a href='#f1392' class='c013'><sup>[1392]</sup></a> A similar case, fatal in two hours, has
been related by Dr. Wach of Merseburg. A middle-aged woman
who, though generally in good health, had suffered for a day or two
from pains in the stomach, took one morning a solution of half an
ounce of chloride of barium by mistake for sulphate of soda. She
was soon seized with sickness, retching, convulsive twitches of the
hands and feet, vomiting of clear mucus, great anxiety, restlessness,
and loss of voice; and she died under constant efforts to vomit, and
violent convulsive movements, but with her faculties entire.<a id='r1393' /><a href='#f1393' class='c013'><sup>[1393]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Unpleasant effects have been observed from too large doses of the
chloride administered medicinally. A case is mentioned in the
Medical Commentaries of a gentleman who was directed to take a
solution as a stomachic, but swallowed one evening by accident so
much as seventy or eighty drops. He had soon after profuse purging
without tormina, then vomiting, and half an hour after swallowing
the salt excessive muscular debility, amounting to absolute paraplegia
of the limbs. This state lasted about twenty-four hours, and then
gradually went off.<a id='r1394' /><a href='#f1394' class='c013'><sup>[1394]</sup></a> I have known violent vomiting, gripes, and
diarrhœa produced in like manner by a quantity not much exceeding
the usual medicinal doses.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Wilson of London has lately described a distinct case of poisoning
with the carbonate. The quantity taken was half a tea-cupful;
but emetics were given, and operated before any symptoms showed
themselves. In two hours the patient complained of dimness of
sight, double vision, headache, tinnitus, and a sense of distension in
the stomach, and subsequently of pains in the knees and cramps of
the legs, with occasional vomiting and purging next day; for some
days afterwards the head symptoms continued, though more mildly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>and she was much subject to severe palpitations; but she was in the
way of recovery when the account of her case was published.<a id='r1395' /><a href='#f1395' class='c013'><sup>[1395]</sup></a> Mr.
Parkes mentions that, according to information communicated to
him by the proprietor of an estate in Lancashire, where carbonate of
baryta abounds, many domestic animals on his estate died in consequence
of licking the dust of the carbonate, and that it once proved
fatal to two persons, a woman and her child, who took each about a
drachm.<a id='r1396' /><a href='#f1396' class='c013'><sup>[1396]</sup></a> Dr. Johnstone says he once swallowed ten grains of this
compound, without experiencing any bad effect.<a id='r1397' /><a href='#f1397' class='c013'><sup>[1397]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> III.—<i>Of the Morbid Appearances caused by the Salts of Baryta.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>In animals the mucous membrane of the stomach is usually found
of a deep-red colour, unless death take place with great rapidity, in
which case the alimentary canal is healthy. In all the animals,
which in Dr. Campbell’s experiments were killed by the application
of the muriate to wounds, the brain and its membranes were much
injected with blood; and in one of them the appearances were precisely
those of congestive apoplexy.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Wach’s case the stomach was dark brownish-red externally,
and the small intestines brighter red. Internally the stomach presented
uniform deep redness, with clots of blood, and bloody mucus
scattered over it; and near the cardiac end there was a perforation,
above half an inch in diameter within, and half as wide at the outside,
and surrounded with swollen edges and extensive thickening
of the villous coat. The small intestines were internally very red
and lined with red mucus interspersed with clots of blood. The
great intestines were extremely contracted. The lungs were gorged,
the heart full of dark liquid blood, and the cerebral vessels distended.
Chloride of barium was detected in the stomach and intestines. The
perforation in this case was evidently an accidental concurrence.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> IV.—<i>Of the Treatment.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The treatment of this variety of poisoning consists chiefly in the
speedy administration of some alkaline or earthy sulphate, such as
the sulphate of soda or sulphate of magnesia. The poison is thus
immediately converted into the insoluble sulphate of baryta, which is
quite inert. Two drachms of muriate of baryta were injected by
Orfila into the stomach of a dog, and eight minutes afterwards two
drachms of sulphate of soda. The gullet was then secured by a
ligature. At first efforts were made to vomit, and in an hour sulphate
of baryta was discharged with the alvine evacuations. There
was neither insensibility nor convulsions; and the next morning the
animal evidently suffered only from the ligature on the gullet. This
fact not only proves the efficacy of the sulphate, but likewise shows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>that in the kinds of poisoning where diarrhœa occurs, the poison is
very soon discharged, and ought therefore to be looked for in the
evacuations from the bowels.<a id='r1398' /><a href='#f1398' class='c013'><sup>[1398]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>A few observations may be here added on the effects of the salts
of <i>strontia</i> on the animal frame. These compounds bear a close
resemblance to the salts of baryta, and the two earths were consequently
long confounded together till Dr. Hope pointed out their
distinctions. One of the most striking differences is, that the salts
of the strontia are very feebly poisonous. Some experiments of this
purport were made by M. Pelletier of Paris,<a id='r1399' /><a href='#f1399' class='c013'><sup>[1399]</sup></a> and by Blumenbach;
but the most accurate researches are those of Professor Gmelin. He
found that ten grains of the chloride in solution had no effect when
injected into the jugular vein of a dog,—that two drachms had no
effect when introduced into the stomach of a rabbit,—that half an
ounce was required to cause death in that way,—that two drachms
of the carbonate had no effect,—and that two drachms of the nitrate,
dissolved in six parts of water and given to a rabbit, merely caused
increase of the frequency and hardness of the pulse and a brisk diarrhœa.<a id='r1400' /><a href='#f1400' class='c013'><sup>[1400]</sup></a>
Mr. Blake also found that small doses of the salts of strontia
have little effect when injected into the veins; but that forty grains
arrest the action of the heart in fifteen seconds.<a id='r1401' /><a href='#f1401' class='c013'><sup>[1401]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<p class='c005'>The fourth order of the irritant poisons contains a great number of
genera derived from the vegetable kingdom, and at one time commonly
arranged in a class by themselves under the title of Acrid
Poisons. The order includes many plants of the natural families
<i>Ranunculaceæ</i>, <i>Cucurbitaceæ</i>, and <i>Euphorbiaceæ</i>, and other plants
scattered throughout the botanical system. It likewise comprehends
a second group consisting of some acrid poisons from the animal
kingdom, namely, cantharides, poisonous fishes, poisonous serpents,
and animal matters become poisonous by disease or putrefaction.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>OF POISONING WITH THE VEGETABLE ACRIDS.</h4>

<p class='c012'>The vegetable acrids are the most characteristic poisons of this
order. They will not require many details, as they are seldom resorted
to for criminal purposes, and their mode of action, their symptoms,
and their morbid appearances are nearly the same in all.</p>

<p class='c006'>We are chiefly indebted to Professor Orfila for our knowledge of
their <i>mode of action</i>. He has subjected them to two sets of experiments.
In the first place, he introduced the poison in various doses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>into the stomach, sometimes tying the gullet, sometimes not: and,
secondly, he applied the poison to the subcutaneous cellular tissue
by thrusting it into a recent wound.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the former way he found that, unless the gullet was tied, the
animal soon discharged the poison by vomiting, and generally recovered;
but that, if the gullet was tied, death might be caused in
no long time by moderate doses. The symptoms were seldom remarkable.
Commonly efforts were made to vomit; frequently diarrhœa
followed; then languor and listlessness; sometimes, though not
always, expressions of pain; very rarely convulsions; and death
generally took place during the first day, often within three, six, or
eight hours. The appearances in the dead body were redness over
the whole mucous coat of the stomach, at times remarkably vivid,
often barely perceptible, and occasionally attended with ulcers; very
often a similar state of the whole intestines, more especially of the
rectum; and in some instances a slight increase of density, with
diminished crepitation, in patches of the lungs.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the poison, on the other hand, was applied to a recent
wound of the leg, the animal commonly whined more or less; great
languor soon followed; and death took place on the first or second
day, without convulsions or any other symptom of note. It was
seldom that any morbid appearance could then be discovered in the
bowels. But in every instance active inflammation was found in the
wound, extending to the limb above it and even upwards on the
trunk. Every part affected was gorged with blood and serum; and
an eschar was never formed. The appearances in short were precisely
those of diffuse inflammation of the cellular tissue, when it
proves fatal in its early stage.<a id='r1402' /><a href='#f1402' class='c013'><sup>[1402]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Since these poisons do not appear to act more energetically through
a wound than through the stomach, it has been generally inferred
that they do not enter the blood, and consequently that the local
impression they produce is conveyed to distant organs through the
nerves. This inference is correct in regard to such species of the
vegetable acrids as act in small doses. But the validity of the conclusion
may be questioned when the poison acts only in large doses,
as in the case with many of those now under consideration. For
they cannot be applied to a wound over a surface equal to that of
the stomach, and may therefore be more slowly absorbed in the
former than in the latter situation. And, in point of fact, a few
plants of the present order have been found to act through the medium
of absorption, as soon as chemistry discovered their active
principles, and thus enabled the physiologist to get rid of fallacy by
using the poison in small quantity. This principle has been proved
to be in some plants a peculiar resin, in others a peculiar extractive
matter, in others an oil, in others an alkaloid, and in others a neutral
crystalline matter. But in all there exists some principle or other
in which are concentrated the poisonous properties of the plant.
Some of these principles appear to act through the medium of the
blood.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>There is no doubt, however, but many plants of the present order,
as well as their active principles, have a totally different and very
peculiar action. They produce violent spreading inflammation of
the subcutaneous cellular tissue, and acute inflammation of the stomach
and intestines, without entering the blood; and death is the
consequence of a sympathy of remote organs with the parts directly
injured.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to their forming a natural order of poisons, it is evident, that if
a general view be taken of their properties, they are distinguished
by obvious phenomena from the three orders hitherto noticed. But if
their effects on man be alone taken into account, when of course their
influence on the external surface of the body must be left out of view,
nothing will be discovered to distinguish them from several of the
metallic irritants.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>symptoms</i> occasioned in man by the irritant poisons of the
vegetable kingdom, are chiefly those indicating inflammation of the
villous coat of the stomach and intestines. When taken in large
doses, they excite vomiting soon after they are swallowed; by which
means the patient’s life is often saved. But sometimes, like the
mineral poisons that possess emetic properties, the vegetable acrids
present a singular uncertainty in this respect: they may be retained
without much inconvenience for some length of time. If this should
happen, or if the dose be less, in which case vomiting may not be
produced at all, or if only part of a large dose be discharged at an
early period by vomiting,—the other phenomena they give rise to
are sometimes fully developed. The most conspicuous symptom then
is diarrhœa, more or less profuse. The diarrhœa and vomiting are
commonly attended by twisting pain of the belly, at first remittent,
but gradually more constant, as the inflammation becomes more and
more strongly marked. Tension, fulness and tenderness of the belly,
are then not unfrequent. The stools may assume all the characters
of the discharges in natural inflammation of the intestinal mucous
membrane, but an additional character worthy of notice is the appearance
of fragments of leaves or flowers belonging to the plant which
has been swallowed. At the same time there is generally excessive
weakness. Sometimes, too, giddiness and a tendency to delirium
have been observed. But the latter symptoms are rare: if they
occurred frequently, it would be necessary to transfer any poison
which produced them to the class of narcotico-acrids.</p>

<p class='c006'>The properties now mentioned have long ago attracted the attention
of physicians, and led them to introduce many vegetable irritants
into the materia medica. In fact they comprehended a great number
of the most active, or, as they are technically called, drastic
purgatives. Among others, elaterium, euphorbium, gamboge, colocynth,
scammony, croton, jalap, savin, stavesacre, are of this description.
The effect of most of them, however, is so violent and uncertain,
that few are now much used except when combined with other
milder laxatives.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>morbid appearances</i> they leave in the dead body are the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>with those noticed under the head of their mode of action,—more or
less redness of the stomach, ulceration of its villous coat, redness of
the intestines, and especially of the rectum and colon, which are often
inflamed when the small intestines are not visibly affected.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the following account of the particular poisons of this order, a
very cursory view will be taken of their physical and chemical properties.
A knowledge of these properties will be best acquired from
any author on the materia medica; and an account of them would be
misplaced in a work which professes to describe only the leading
objects of the medical jurist’s attention.</p>

<p class='c006'>A great number of genera might be arranged under the present
head. But the following list comprehends all which require mention.
<i>Euphorbia</i>, or spurge, the <i>ricinus</i>, or castor-oil tree, the <i>jatropha</i>,
or cassava-plant, croton-oil, <i>elaterium</i>, or squirting cucumber, <i>colocynth</i>,
or bitter-apple, <i>bryony</i>, or wild cucumber, <i>ranunculus</i>, or buttercup,
<i>anemone</i>, <i>stavesacre</i>, <i>celandine</i>, <i>marsh marigold</i>, <i>mezereon</i>, <i>spurge-laurel</i>,
<i>savine</i>, <i>daffodil</i>, <i>jalap</i>, <i>manchineel</i>, <i>cuckow-pint</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first plants to be noticed belong to the natural order <i>Euphorbiaceæ</i>,
namely, the euphorbia, ricinus, jatropha, and croton.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Euphorbium.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'><i>Euphorbium</i> is the inspissated juice of various plants of the genus
euphorbia or spurge, but is principally procured from the <i>E. officinarum</i>,
a species that abounds in Northern Africa. It contains a variety
of principles; but its chief ingredient is a resin, in which its active
properties reside. It has been analysed by Braconnot, Pelletier,
Brandes,<a id='r1403' /><a href='#f1403' class='c013'><sup>[1403]</sup></a> and Drs. Buchner and Herberger. According to Brandes
the resin forms above 44 per cent. of the crude drug, and is so very
acrid, that the eyelid is inflamed by rubbing it with the finger which
has touched the resin, even although it be subsequently washed with
an alkali.<a id='r1404' /><a href='#f1404' class='c013'><sup>[1404]</sup></a> According to the most recent analysis, that of Drs. Buchner
and Herberger, this resin is a compound substance, which consists
of two resinous principles, one possessing in some degree the
properties of an acid, and the other the properties of a base. The
latter, which they have called euphorbin, is considered by them the
true active principle of euphorbium.<a id='r1405' /><a href='#f1405' class='c013'><sup>[1405]</sup></a> It will be mentioned under
the head of Jalap, that they have taken the same view of the nature
of other resinous poisons.</p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila found that a large dog was killed in twenty-six hours and a
half by half an ounce of powder of euphorbium introduced into the
stomach, and retained there by a ligature on the gullet.</p>

<p class='c006'>The whole coats of the stomach, but especially the villous membrane,
were of a deep-red or almost black colour; the colon, and still
more the rectum, were of a lively red internally, and their inner
membrane was checkered with little ulcers. Two drachms of the
powder thrust into a wound in the thigh, and secured by covering it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>with the flaps of the incision, killed a dog in twenty-seven hours;
and death was preceded by no remarkable symptom except great
languor. The wounded limb was found after death highly inflamed,
and the redness and sanguinolent infiltration, which were alluded to
in the general observations on the vegetable acrids, extended from
the knee as high up the trunk as the fifth rib,—a striking proof of
the rapidity with which this variety of inflammation diffuses itself.<a id='r1406' /><a href='#f1406' class='c013'><sup>[1406]</sup></a>
Mr. Blake concludes from his experiments, that euphorbium, when
injected in a state of solution in the jugular vein, acts by obstructing
both the pulmonary and systemic capillaries, and so preventing the
passage of the blood into the left side of the heart; but that the heart
is not primarily acted on.<a id='r1407' /><a href='#f1407' class='c013'><sup>[1407]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The most common symptoms occasioned in man by euphorbium
are violent griping and purging, and excessive exhaustion; but it appears
probable that narcotic symptoms are also at times induced. A
case of irritant poisoning with it has been related in the Philosophical
Transactions; but it is not a pure one, as a large quantity of camphor
was taken at the same time. Much irritation was produced in the
alimentary canal; but by the prompt excitement of vomiting and the
subsequent use of opium the patient soon recovered.<a id='r1408' /><a href='#f1408' class='c013'><sup>[1408]</sup></a> Mr. Furnival
has related a fatal case which arose from a farrier having given a man
a tea-spoonful by mistake for rhubarb. Burning heat in the throat and
then in the stomach, vomiting, irregular hurried pulse, and cold perspiration
were the leading symptoms; and the person died in three
days. Several gangrenous spots were found in the stomach, and its
coats tore with the slightest touch.<a id='r1409' /><a href='#f1409' class='c013'><sup>[1409]</sup></a> The operation of this substance
is so violent and uncertain, that it has long ceased to be employed
inwardly in the regular practice of medicine, and has been even excluded
from some modern Pharmacopœias. It is still used by farriers
as an external application; and in the Infirmary of this city I met with
a fatal case of poisoning in the human subject, which was supposed
to have been produced by a mixture containing it, and intended to
cure horses of the grease. Pyl has related the proceedings in a prosecution
against a man for putting powder of euphorbium into his maid-servant’s
bed; and from this narrative it appears, that, when applied
to the sound skin, it causes violent heat, itching and smarting, succeeded
by inflammation and blisters.<a id='r1410' /><a href='#f1410' class='c013'><sup>[1410]</sup></a> Dr. Veitch denies that the
powder has any such power;<a id='r1411' /><a href='#f1411' class='c013'><sup>[1411]</sup></a> but the effects described by Pyl correspond
with popular belief.</p>

<p class='c006'>Probably all the species of euphorbium possess the same properties
as <i>E. officinarum</i>. Orfila found that the juice of the leaves of E.
<i>cyparissias</i> and <i>lathyris</i> produces precisely the effects described above.
Sproegel applied the juice of the latter to his face, and was attacked
in consequence with an eruption like nettle-rash; and he found that
it caused warts and hair to drop out.<a id='r1412' /><a href='#f1412' class='c013'><sup>[1412]</sup></a> Vicat mentions analogous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>facts, and Lamotte notices the case of a patient who died in consequence
of a clyster having been prepared with this species instead of
the mercurialis.<a id='r1413' /><a href='#f1413' class='c013'><sup>[1413]</sup></a> The seeds and root of the <i>E. lathyris</i> or caper-spurge
are used by the inhabitants of the northern Alps in the dose of fifteen
grains as an emetic; and very lately the oil of the seeds has been employed
in Italy as an active purgative, which in the dose of two or
eight grains is said to possess all the efficacy of croton oil.<a id='r1414' /><a href='#f1414' class='c013'><sup>[1414]</sup></a> MM.
Chevallier and Aubergier have also found the seeds of the <i>E. hybeua</i>
and their expressed oil to be very energetic. The seeds yield 44 per
cent. of oil, which in the dose of ten drops produces copious watery
evacuations without pain, and resembles closely croton-oil in its
effects.<a id='r1415' /><a href='#f1415' class='c013'><sup>[1415]</sup></a> The <i>E. esula</i> appears to be a very active species. Scopoli
says that a woman who took thirty grains of the root died in half an
hour, and that he once knew it cause fatal gangrene when imprudently
applied to the skin of the belly.<a id='r1416' /><a href='#f1416' class='c013'><sup>[1416]</sup></a> Withering observes that all the indigenous
species blister and ulcerate the skin, and that many of them
are used by country people for these purposes.<a id='r1417' /><a href='#f1417' class='c013'><sup>[1417]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>I have no where seen any notice taken by authors of narcotic symptoms
as the effect of poisoning with euphorbium; and indeed this
substance has always been considered a pure irritant. I am informed,
however, by the Messrs. Herring, wholesale druggists in
London, that their workmen are subject to headache, giddiness and
stupor, if they do not carefully avoid the dust thrown up while it is
ground in the mill; and that the men themselves are familiarly acquainted
with this risk. An analogous fact has likewise been communicated
to me by Dr. Hood of this city, relative to the effects of
the seeds of the <i>E. lathyris</i>. A child two years of age ate some of
the seeds, and soon after vomited severely, which is the usual effect.
Drowsiness, however, succeeded; and after a few returns of vomiting,
which were promoted by an emetic, deep sleep gradually came
on, broken by convulsions, stertorous breathing and sighs. Sensibility
was somewhat restored by blood-letting and the warm bath;
after which the tendency to sleep was interrupted by frequent agitation
and exercise in the open air. The vomiting then recurred for
a time; but the child eventually got well.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with the Seeds of the Castor-Oil Tree.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'><i>Castor-oil</i> at present so extensively used as a mild and effectual
laxative, is nevertheless derived from a plant hardly inferior in activity
as a poison to that just considered. It is the expressed oil of
the seeds of the <i>Ricinus communis</i> or Palma Christi. Much discussion
has taken place as to the source of the acrid properties of this
seed, some supposing that they reside in the embryo, others in the perisperm,
others in the cotyledon, others in a principle formed from the oil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>by heat; and the question is scarcely yet settled. It is certain, however,
that, although castor oil owes its occasional acridity to changes
effected by the heat to which it is sometimes exposed in the process
of separation, nevertheless the cotyledons are in themselves acrid.<a id='r1418' /><a href='#f1418' class='c013'><sup>[1418]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Two or three of the seeds will operate as a violent cathartic. Bergius,
as quoted by Orfila, says he knew a stout man who was attacked
with profuse vomiting and purging after having masticated a
single seed. Lanzoni met with an instance where three grains of the
fresh seeds, taken by a young woman, caused so violent vomiting,
hiccup, pain in the stomach, and faintness, that for some time her
life was considered in great danger.<a id='r1419' /><a href='#f1419' class='c013'><sup>[1419]</sup></a> Mr. Alfred Taylor met with
three cases of poisoning with castor-oil seeds. Two sisters, who
took each from two to four seeds, suffered severely; and a third,
who took twenty, died in five days, with symptoms like those of malignant
cholera.<a id='r1420' /><a href='#f1420' class='c013'><sup>[1420]</sup></a> Climate probably affects their activity; for I have
known a person eat without any effect several seeds ripened in the
open air in this neighbourhood. Dogs vomit so easily that they may
take thirty seeds without material inconvenience, if the gullet is
not tied. But if the gullet is secured, a much less quantity will
occasion death in six hours. They produce violent inflammation
when applied to a wound.<a id='r1421' /><a href='#f1421' class='c013'><sup>[1421]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with the Physic-nut.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The plants of the genus <i>Jatropha</i>, belonging to the same natural
family, have all of them the same acrid properties as the castor-oil
tree. The seeds of the <i>J. curcas</i>, the physic-nut of the West Indies,
when applied in the form of powder to a wound, produce violent
spreading inflammation of the subcutaneous cellular tissue; and when
introduced into the stomach they inflame that organ and the intestines.<a id='r1422' /><a href='#f1422' class='c013'><sup>[1422]</sup></a>
Four seeds will act on man as a powerful cathartic.<a id='r1423' /><a href='#f1423' class='c013'><sup>[1423]</sup></a> I have
known violent vomiting and purging occasioned by a few grains of
the cake, left after expression of the fixed oil from the bruised seeds;
and in some experiments performed a few years ago, I found that
twelve or fifteen drops of the oil produced exactly the same effects
as an ounce of castor-oil, though not with such certainty. In the last
edition of this work some observations were made, on the authority
of MM. Pelletier and Caventou, respecting the properties of a pure
oil and a volatile acid, supposed by them to exist in the physic-nut;
but they analyzed the croton seed by mistake for it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Two other species have been also examined, but not with care,
namely, the <i>Jatropha multifida</i>, and the <i>Jatropha</i> or <i>Janipha manihot</i>.
It is probable that the seeds of both are acrid, and also the oil which
may be extracted from them by pressure. But a much more interesting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>part of the latter species in a toxicological point of view is the
root; the juice of which is a most energetic poison. The <i>Janipha
manihot</i>, or cassava-plant, has two varieties, one of which produces
a small, spindle-shaped, bland root, called, in the West Indies, sweet
cassava, while the other has a much larger, bitter, poisonous root,
called bitter cassava, and in universal use for obtaining the well-known
amylaceous substance, tapioca. The juice of the bitter
variety is watery, and so poisonous that, according to Dr. Clark
of Dominica, negroes have been killed in an hour by drinking
half a pint of it.<a id='r1424' /><a href='#f1424' class='c013'><sup>[1424]</sup></a> It has been commonly, but erroneously, arranged
among acrid poisons. It really belongs to the narcotic class, for it
occasions coma and convulsions. And we now know the cause of
this extraordinary anomaly in the natural family to which the species
belongs; because MM. Henry and Boutron ascertained that the juice
imported into France, as well as what they expressed from fresh roots
sent from the West Indies, contains hydrocyanic acid, produces in
animals all the usual effects of that poison, and is rendered inert by
such means as will remove the acid,—for example, by the addition
of nitrate of silver.<a id='r1425' /><a href='#f1425' class='c013'><sup>[1425]</sup></a> I confirmed this singular discovery in 1838 by
examination of some well-preserved juice from Demerara. It is easy
to see how tapioca, which is obtained from the poisonous root by
careful elutriation, becomes quite bland during the process.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Manchineel.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The <i>manchineel</i> [<i>Hippomane mancinella</i>], another plant of the same
natural family, contains a milky juice, which is possessed of very
acrid properties. Orfila and Ollivier have made some careful experiments
with it on animals,<a id='r1426' /><a href='#f1426' class='c013'><sup>[1426]</sup></a> and M. Ricord has since added some
observations on its effects on man.<a id='r1427' /><a href='#f1427' class='c013'><sup>[1427]</sup></a> From the former it appears that
two drachms of the juice applied to a wound in a dog will cause death
in twenty-eight hours, by exciting diffuse cellular inflammation; and
that half that quantity will prove fatal in nine hours when introduced
into the stomach. From the observations of M. Ricord it follows
that inflammation is excited wherever the juice is applied,
even in the sound skin; but he denies the generally received notion,
that similar effects ensue from sleeping under the branches of the tree,
or receiving drops of moisture from the leaves. This notion, however,
it is right to add, has been adopted by other recent authors.
Descourtils, for example, states that it is dangerous to sleep under the
tree; that drops of rain from the leaves will blister any part of the
skin on which they fall; and that on these accounts the police of St.
Domingo were in the practice of destroying the trees wherever they
grew.<a id='r1428' /><a href='#f1428' class='c013'><sup>[1428]</sup></a> Other species of Hippomane are equally poisonous. The
<i>H. biglandulosa</i> and <i>H. spinosa</i> are peculiarly so, especially the latter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>which is known to the negroes of St. Domingo by the name of
Zombi apple, and is familiarly used by them as a potent poison.<a id='r1429' /><a href='#f1429' class='c013'><sup>[1429]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Croton.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The oil of the <i>Croton Tiglium</i> has been familiarly known for some
years as a very powerful hydragogue cathartic in the dose of a few
drops; and therefore little doubt could exist that both the oil and
the seed which yields it must be active irritant poisons in moderate
doses. Accordingly it has been lately found by experiments in Germany
that forty seeds will kill a horse in the course of seven hours;<a id='r1430' /><a href='#f1430' class='c013'><sup>[1430]</sup></a>
and Rumphius mentions that it was a common poison in his time at
Amboyna among the natives. I have known most violent watery
purging and great prostration caused by four drops of the expressed
oil. A fatal case of poisoning with it occurred not long ago in France.
A young man who swallowed two drachms and a half of the oil by
mistake, instead of using it as an embrocation, was soon seized with
tenderness of the belly, violent efforts to vomit, cold sweating, laborious
respiration, blueness of the lips and fingers, and an almost imperceptible
pulse,—then with profuse, involuntary discharges by
stool, burning along the throat and gullet, and insensibility of the
skin;—and in four hours he expired. The villous coat of the
stomach was soft, but not otherwise injured.<a id='r1431' /><a href='#f1431' class='c013'><sup>[1431]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The activity of the seed and oil seems to depend on a peculiar
volatile acid, which was discovered by MM. Pelletier and Caventou
when they analysed the croton seed by mistake as the seed of the
<i>Jatropha curcas</i>, or physic-nut. When the oil was saponified by potash
and then freed of the acid by distillation, it became inert. On the
other hand, the acid was found by them to excite inflammation of the
stomach, and spreading inflammation of the cellular tissue, according as
it was administered internally or applied to a wound.<a id='r1432' /><a href='#f1432' class='c013'><sup>[1432]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The next natural family in which plants are to be found that possess
the properties of the acrid poisons, is the <i>Cucurbitaceæ</i>, or gourds.
This family, it should be remarked, does not in general possess poisonous
properties. On the contrary, they are, with a few exceptions,
remarkably mild; and many of them supply articles of luxury for
the table. The melon, gourd, and cucumber belong to the order.
The only poisons of the order which have been examined with any
care are elaterium, bryony, and colocynth.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Bryony.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The roots of the <i>Bryonia alba</i> and <i>Dioica</i> possesses properties essentially
the same with those of euphorbium. The <i>B. dioica</i> is a native
of Britain, where it grows among hedges, and is usually known by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>the name of wild vine, or bryony. The flowers are greenish, and are
succeeded by small, red berries. The root, which is the most active
part of the plant, is spindle-shaped, and varies in size from that of a
man’s thigh to that of a radish.</p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila found that half an ounce of the root introduced into the
stomach of a dog, killed it in twenty-four hours, when the gullet was
tied; and that two drachms and a half applied to a wound brought
on violent inflammation and suppuration of the part, ending fatally
in sixty hours.<a id='r1433' /><a href='#f1433' class='c013'><sup>[1433]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Bryony root owes its power to an extractive matter discovered in
it by Brandes and Firnhaber, to which the name of Bryonine has
been given. According to the experiments of Collard de Martigny,
bryonine acts on the stomach and on a wound exactly as the root
itself, but more energetically. When introduced into the cavity of the
pleura it causes rapid death by true pleurisy, ending in the effusion
of fibrin.<a id='r1434' /><a href='#f1434' class='c013'><sup>[1434]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Before bryony-root was expelled from medical practice, it was
often known to produce violent vomiting, tormina, profuse watery
evacuations, and fainting. Pyl mentions a fatal case of poisoning
with it, which happened at Cambray in France. The subject was a
man who took two glasses of an infusion of the root to cure ague, and
was soon after seized with violent tormina and purging, which nothing
could arrest, and which soon terminated fatally.<a id='r1435' /><a href='#f1435' class='c013'><sup>[1435]</sup></a> Orfila quotes a
similar case from the Gazette de Santé, which proved fatal within
four hours, in consequence of a strong decoction of an ounce of the
root having been administered, partly by the mouth and partly in a
clyster, to repel the secretion of milk.<a id='r1436' /><a href='#f1436' class='c013'><sup>[1436]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Colocynth.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Colocynth, or bitter-apple, is another very active and more common
acrid derived from a plant of the same family, the Cucumis colocynthis.
It is imported into this country in the form of a roundish,
dry, light fruit, as big as an orange, of a yellowish-white colour, and
excessively bitter taste. Its active principle is probably a resinoid
matter discovered by Vauquelin, which is very soluble in alcohol and
sparingly so in water, but which imparts even to the latter an intensely
bitter taste.<a id='r1437' /><a href='#f1437' class='c013'><sup>[1437]</sup></a> It is termed Colocynthin.</p>

<p class='c006'>According to the experiments of Orfila, colocynth powder or its
decoction produces the usual effects of the acrid vegetables on the
stomach and on the subcutaneous cellular tissue. Three drachms
proved fatal in fifteen hours to a dog through the former channel
when the gullet was tied, and two drachms killed another when applied
to a wound.<a id='r1438' /><a href='#f1438' class='c013'><sup>[1438]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>A considerable number of severe cases of poisoning with this substance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>have occurred in the human subject; and a few have proved
fatal. Tulpius notices the case of a man who was nearly carried off
by profuse, bloody diarrhœa, in consequence of taking a decoction
of three colocynth apples.<a id='r1439' /><a href='#f1439' class='c013'><sup>[1439]</sup></a> Orfila relates that of a rag-picker, who,
attempting to cure himself of a gonorrhœa by taking three ounces
of colocynth, was seized with vomiting, acute pain in the stomach,
profuse diarrhœa, dimness of sight, and slight delirium; but he recovered
under the use of diluents and local blood-letting.<a id='r1440' /><a href='#f1440' class='c013'><sup>[1440]</sup></a> In 1823
a coroner’s inquest was held at London on the body of a woman
who died in twenty-four hours, with incessant vomiting and purging,
in consequence of having swallowed by mistake a tea-spoonful and
a half of colocynth powder.<a id='r1441' /><a href='#f1441' class='c013'><sup>[1441]</sup></a> M. Carron d’Annecy has communicated
to Orfila the details of an instructive case, which also proved
fatal. The subject was a locksmith, who took from a quack two
glasses of decoction of colocynth to cure hemorrhoids, and was soon
after attacked with colic, purging, heat in the belly, and dryness of
the throat. Afterwards the belly became tense and excessively tender,
and the stools were suppressed altogether. Next morning he had
also retention of urine, retraction of the testicles and priapism. On
the third day the retention ceased, but the other symptoms continued,
and the skin became covered with clammy sweat, which preceded
his death only a few hours. The intestines were red, studded with
black spots, and matted together by fibrinous matter; the usual fluid
of peritonitis was effused into the belly; the villous coat of the
stomach was here and there ulcerated; and the liver, kidneys, and
bladder also exhibited traces of inflammation.<a id='r1442' /><a href='#f1442' class='c013'><sup>[1442]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Elaterium.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Elaterium, which is procured from a third plant of the cucurbitaceæ,
the <i>Momordica elaterium</i> or squirting cucumber, possesses
precisely the same properties with the two preceding substances. It
appears, however, to be more active; for a single grain has been
known to act violently on man. There can be no doubt that small
doses will prove fatal; but its strength and consequently its effects
are uncertain. British elaterium, which is the feculence that subsides
in the juice of the fruit, is the most powerful; French elaterium,
which is the extract of the same juice, is much weaker; and a still
weaker preparation sometimes made is an extract of the juice of the
whole plant. The plant itself is probably poisonous. But the only
case in point with which I am acquainted is a singular instance of
poisoning, apparently produced in consequence of the plant having
been carried for some time betwixt the hat and head. A medical
gentleman in Paris, after carrying a specimen to his lodgings in his
hat, was seized in half an hour with acute pain and sense of tightness
in the head, succeeded by colic pains, fixed pain in the stomach,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>frequent watery purging, bilious vomiting, and some fever. These
symptoms continued upwards of twelve hours.<a id='r1443' /><a href='#f1443' class='c013'><sup>[1443]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The active properties of this substance reside in a peculiar crystalline
principle, discovered by Mr. Morries-Stirling, and named by
him <i>Elaterine</i>. It is procured by evaporating the alcoholic infusion
of elaterium to the consistence of thin oil, and throwing it into boiling
distilled water; upon which a white crystalline precipitate is
formed, and more falls down as the water cools. This precipitate
when purified by a second solution in alcohol and precipitation by
water, is pure elaterine. In mass it has a silky appearance. The
crystals are microscopic rhombic prisms, striated on the sides. It is
intensely bitter. It does not dissolve in the alkalis, or in water, is
sparingly soluble in diluted acids, but easily soluble in alcohol, ether,
and fixed oil. It has not any alkaline reaction on litmus.—It is a poison
of very great activity. A tenth of a grain, as I have myself witnessed,
will sometimes cause purging in man; and a fifth of a grain in two
doses, administered at an interval of twenty-four hours to a rabbit,
killed it seventeen hours after the second dose. The best British
elaterium contains 26 per cent. of it, the worst 15 per cent.; but
French elaterium does not contain above 5 or 6 per cent.<a id='r1444' /><a href='#f1444' class='c013'><sup>[1444]</sup></a> These facts account
for the great irregularity in the effects of this drug as a cathartic.
The principle discovered by Mr. Morries-Stirling was also discovered
about the same time by Mr. Hennell<a id='r1445' /><a href='#f1445' class='c013'><sup>[1445]</sup></a> of London.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with the Ranunculaceæ.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The natural family of the Ranunculaceæ abounds in acrid poisons.
Indeed few of the genera included in it are without more or less acrid
property.</p>

<p class='c006'>The genus <i>Ranunculus</i> is of some interest to the British toxicologist,
because many species grow in this country, and unpleasant accidents
have been occasioned by them. The most common are the
<i>R. bulbosus</i>, <i>acris</i>, <i>sceleratus</i>, <i>Flammula</i>, <i>Lingua</i>, <i>aquatilis</i>, <i>repens</i>,
<i>Ficaria</i>, which are all abundant in the neighbourhood of this city.
The <i>Ranunculus acris</i> is the only species that has been particularly
examined. Five ounces of juice, extracted by triturating the leaves
with two ounces of water, killed a stout dog in twelve hours when
taken internally. Two drachms of the aqueous extract applied to a
wound killed another in twelve hours by inducing the usual inflammation.<a id='r1446' /><a href='#f1446' class='c013'><sup>[1446]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Krapf, as quoted in Orfila’s Toxicology, found by experiments on
himself, that two drops of the expressed juice of the <i>Ranunculus
acris</i> produced burning pain and spasms in the gullet and griping in
the lower belly. A single flower had the same effect. When he
chewed the thickest and most succulent of the leaves, the salivary
glands were strongly stimulated, his tongue was excoriated and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>cracked, his teeth smarted, and his gums became tender and bloody.<a id='r1447' /><a href='#f1447' class='c013'><sup>[1447]</sup></a>
Dr. Withering alleges that it will blister the skin. A man at Bevay
in the north of France, after swallowing by mistake a glassful of the
juice which had been kept for some time as a remedy for vermin on
the head, was seized in four hours with violent vomiting and colic,
and expired in two days.<a id='r1448' /><a href='#f1448' class='c013'><sup>[1448]</sup></a> The acridity of the genus ranunculus is
entirely lost by drying, either with or without artificial heat. The <i>R.
acris</i>, however, is far from being the most active species of the genus.
The taste of the leaves of <i>R. bulbosus</i>, <i>alpestris</i>, <i>gramineus</i>, and
<i>Flammula</i>, and also of the unripe germens of <i>R. sceleratus</i>, is much
more pungent. The <i>R. repens</i>, <i>Ficaria</i>, <i>auricomus</i>, <i>aquatilis</i>, and
<i>Lingua</i>, I have found to be bland.</p>

<p class='c006'>The genus <i>Anemone</i> produces similar effects on the animal economy.
The most pungent species I have examined are the <i>A. pulsatilla</i>, <i>A.
hortensis</i>, and <i>A. coronaria</i>; the <i>A. nemorosa</i> and <i>A. patens</i> are less
active; and the <i>A. hepatica</i>, as well as the <i>A. alpestris</i>, are bland.
The powder of the <i>A. pulsatilla</i> causes itching of the eyes, colic and
vomiting, if in pulverizing it the operator do not avoid the fine dust
which is driven up; and Bulliard relates the case of a man who, in
applying the bruised root to his calf for rheumatism, was attacked
with inflammation and gangrene of the whole leg.<a id='r1449' /><a href='#f1449' class='c013'><sup>[1449]</sup></a> The same
author mentions an instance where violent convulsions were produced
by an infusion of the <i>A. nemorosa</i>, and the person was for some time
thought to be in great danger.<a id='r1450' /><a href='#f1450' class='c013'><sup>[1450]</sup></a> The acridity of the anemone is retained
under desiccation even in the vapour-bath; but is very
slowly lost under exposure to the air, not entirely, however, in two
months. The ripe fruit of the <i>A. hortensis</i> is bland. The activity
of the anemones is owing to a volatile oil, which, when left for some
time in the water with which it passes over in distillation is converted
into a neutral crystalline body called anemonine, and a peculiar acid
termed anemonic acid.<a id='r1451' /><a href='#f1451' class='c013'><sup>[1451]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>Caltha palustris</i>, or marsh marigold, a plant closely allied in
external characters to the ranunculus, is considered by toxicologists
a powerful acrid poison. Wibmer observes that it has an acrid,
burning taste,<a id='r1452' /><a href='#f1452' class='c013'><sup>[1452]</sup></a>—a remark which has been also made by Haller.<a id='r1453' /><a href='#f1453' class='c013'><sup>[1453]</sup></a>
On the continent the flower buds are said to be sometimes pickled
and used for capers on account of their pungency. The following
set of cases which happened in 1817 near Solingen will show that in
some localities it possesses energetic and singular properties. The
poison was taken accidentally by a family of five persons, in consequence
of their having been compelled by the badness of the times
to try to make food of various herbs. They were all seized half an
hour after eating with sickness, pain in the abdomen, vomiting, headache,
and ringing in the ears, afterwards with dysuria and diarrhœa,
next day with œdema of the whole body, particularly of the face, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>on the third day with an eruption of pemphigous vesicles as large as
almonds, which dried up in forty-eight hours. They all recovered.<a id='r1454' /><a href='#f1454' class='c013'><sup>[1454]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Notwithstanding these apparently pointed facts, however, I have
no doubt that the marsh marigold is in some circumstances bland,
and is commonly so in this country, or at least but feebly poisonous.
Haller, in speaking of its acrid taste, adds that when young it is
eaten with safety by goats. For my own part I have never been
able to remark any distinct acridity in tasting it either before inflorescence,
or in the young flower-buds, or in any part of the plant
while in full flower. It produces a peculiar, disagreeable impression
on the back of the tongue, when collected in dry situations; but
never occasions that pungent acridity which so remarkably characterizes
many species of ranunculus, anemone, and clematis.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>stavesacre</i>, or <i>Delphinium staphysagria</i>, another plant of the
same natural family, is interesting in a scientific point of view,
because its properties have been distinctly traced to a peculiar alkaloid.
The seeds, which alone have been hitherto examined, were
analyzed by MM. Lassaigne and Feneulle, who, besides a number of
inert principles, discovered in them an alkaloid, possessing in an
eminent degree the poisonous qualities of the seeds. This alkaloid
is solid, white, pulverulent but crystalline, fusible like wax, very
bitter and acrid, almost insoluble in water, very soluble in ether and
alcohol, and capable of forming salts with most of the acids.<a id='r1455' /><a href='#f1455' class='c013'><sup>[1455]</sup></a> It
has been named <i>delphinia</i>. It was also discovered about the same
time by Brandes.<a id='r1456' /><a href='#f1456' class='c013'><sup>[1456]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila found that six grains of it diffused through water, introduced
into the stomach of a dog and retained there with a ligature on the
gullet, brought on efforts to vomit, restlessness, giddiness, immobility,
slight convulsions, and death in two or three hours. The
same quantity, if previously dissolved in vinegar, will cause death
in forty minutes. In the former case, but not in the latter, the inner
coat of the stomach is found to be generally red.<a id='r1457' /><a href='#f1457' class='c013'><sup>[1457]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>An ounce of the bruised seeds themselves killed a dog in fifty-four
hours when introduced into the stomach, and two drachms applied
to a wound in the thigh killed another in two days. In the former
animal a part of the stomach was crimson-red; in the latter there
was extensive subcutaneous inflammation reaching as high as the
fourth rib.<a id='r1458' /><a href='#f1458' class='c013'><sup>[1458]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Besides these four genera of the ranunculaceæ many other genera
of the same natural order are equally energetic. The <i>Clematis vitalba</i>
or traveller’s-joy is said to be acrid, but does not taste so: the <i>C.
flammula</i>, however, is pungently acrid to the taste; it reddens and
blisters the skin; and when swallowed excites inflammation in the
stomach. The <i>trollius</i> or globe flower is also considered acrid; and
its root in appearance, smell, and taste, has been said to resemble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>closely that of the black hellebore. The herb, however, in Scotland,
has certainly none of the peculiar acrid pungency of the ranunculus,
anemone, or clematis, but is on the contrary bland. Some other genera
of equal power have been usually arranged with the narcotico-acrid
poisons on account of their action on the nervous system; and
probably some of the present group of acrids might with equal propriety
be removed to the same class.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of plants possessing acrid properties and interspersed throughout
other natural families, the only species I shall particularly notice
are the mezereon, cuckow-pint, gamboge, daffodil, jalap-plant, and
savine.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Mezereon.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The <i>mezereon</i> and several other species of the genus Daphne to
which it belongs are powerfully acrid. They belong to the natural
order Thymeleæ. The active properties of the bark of mezereon have
been traced to a very acrid resin; and those of the allied species,
<i>Daphne alpina</i>, to a volatile, acrid acid.<a id='r1459' /><a href='#f1459' class='c013'><sup>[1459]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The experiments of Orfila have been confined to a foreign species,
the <i>D. Gnidium</i> or <i>garou</i> of the French. Three drachms of the powder
of its bark retained in the stomach of a dog killed it in twelve
hours; and two drachms applied to a wound killed another in two
days.<a id='r1460' /><a href='#f1460' class='c013'><sup>[1460]</sup></a> The action of the other species has not been so scientifically
investigated; but fatal accidents have arisen from them when taken
by the human species. Children have been tempted to eat the berries
of the <i>D. mezereon</i> by their singular beauty; and some have died
in consequence. Three such cases, not fatal, have been related by
Dr. Grieve of Dumfries. Two of the children had violent vomiting
and purging: in the third narcotic symptoms came on in five hours,
namely, great drowsiness, dilatation of the pupils, extreme slowness
of the pulse, retarded respiration, and freedom from pain.<a id='r1461' /><a href='#f1461' class='c013'><sup>[1461]</sup></a> Vicat
relates the case of a man who took the wood of it for dropsy, and
was attacked with profuse diarrhœa and obstinate vomiting, the last
of which symptoms recurred occasionally for six weeks.<a id='r1462' /><a href='#f1462' class='c013'><sup>[1462]</sup></a> A fatal
case, in a child about eight years of age, occurred a few years ago
in this city. Linnæus in his <i>Flora Suecica</i> says that six berries will
kill a wolf, and that he once saw a girl die of excessive vomiting
and hæmoptysis, in consequence of taking twelve of them to check
an ague.<a id='r1463' /><a href='#f1463' class='c013'><sup>[1463]</sup></a> The <i>D. laureola</i> or spurge-laurel, a common indigenous
species, abounding in low woods, is said by Withering to be very
acrid, especially its root.<a id='r1464' /><a href='#f1464' class='c013'><sup>[1464]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Cuckow-pint.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The <i>Arum maculatum</i>, or cuckow-pint, one of our earliest spring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>flowers, not uncommon in moist ground, under the shelter of woods,
is one of the most violent of all acrid vegetables inhabiting this country.
I have known acute burning pain of the mouth and throat, pain
of the stomach and vomiting, colic and some diarrhœa, occasioned
by eating two leaves. The genus possesses the same properties in
other climates, the several species being everywhere among the most
potent acrid poisons in their respective regions. The <i>Arum seguinum</i>,
or dumb cane of the West Indies, is so active that two drachms of
the juice have been known to prove fatal in a few hours.<a id='r1465' /><a href='#f1465' class='c013'><sup>[1465]</sup></a> It is not
a little remarkable that the acridity of the arum is lost not merely by
drying, but likewise by distillation. I have observed that when the
roots are distilled with a little water, neither the distilled water nor
the residuum possesses acridity. Reinsch says he has eaten powder
of arum root, which, though not acrid to the taste, produced severe
burning of the throat not long after it was swallowed.<a id='r1466' /><a href='#f1466' class='c013'><sup>[1466]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Gamboge.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The familiar pigment and purgative <i>gamboge</i> is one of the pure
acrids, and possesses considerable activity. It appears from the researches
of Orfila,<a id='r1467' /><a href='#f1467' class='c013'><sup>[1467]</sup></a> some experiments by Schubarth,<a id='r1468' /><a href='#f1468' class='c013'><sup>[1468]</sup></a> and various
earlier inquiries quoted by Wibmer,<a id='r1469' /><a href='#f1469' class='c013'><sup>[1469]</sup></a> that two drachms will kill a
sheep; that a drachm and a half will kill a dog if retained by a ligature
on the gullet, while much larger doses have little effect without
this precaution, as the poison is soon vomited; that an ounce has
little effect on the horse; that eighteen grains will prove fatal to the
rabbit within twenty-four hours; and that the symptoms are such as
chiefly indicate an irritant action. Orfila farther found that it produces
intense spreading inflammation when applied to a recent wound,
and in this way may occasion death as quickly and with as great certainty
as when administered internally.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gamboge in its action on man is well known to be one of the
most certain and active of the drastic cathartics, from three to seven
grains being sufficient to cause copious watery diarrhœa, commonly
with smart colic. Larger doses will induce hypercatharsis. A
drachm has proved fatal, as is exemplified by a case in the German
Ephemerides where the symptoms were excessive vomiting, purging,
and faintness.<a id='r1470' /><a href='#f1470' class='c013'><sup>[1470]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Under this head are probably to be arranged the repeated cases,
which have lately occurred in this country, of fatal poisoning with a
noted quack nostrum, Morison’s pills. Almost every physician in
extensive practice has met with cases of violent hypercatharsis occasioned
by the incautious use of these pills; and three instances are
now on record where death was clearly occasioned by them.<a id='r1471' /><a href='#f1471' class='c013'><sup>[1471]</sup></a> No
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>toxicologist will feel any surprise at such results, when he learns that
one sort contains, besides aloes and colocynth, half a grain of gamboge,
and another three times as much, in each pill; and that ten,
fifteen, or even twenty pills are sometimes taken for a dose once or
oftener in the course of the day.<a id='r1472' /><a href='#f1472' class='c013'><sup>[1472]</sup></a> The symptoms in the cases alluded
to were sickness, vomiting and watery purging, pain, tension, fulness,
tenderness, and heat in the abdomen, with cold extremities and sinking
pulse; and in the dead body the appearances were great redness
of the stomach with softening of its villous coat, in the intestines
softening and slate-gray coloration of the same coat, and in one instance
intestinal ulceration.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gamboge is one of the poisons whose energy seems to be irregularly
modified by the co-existence of certain constitutional states in
disease. Physicians in Britain cannot but be startled to hear of the
practice, prevailing among the followers of Rasori in Italy, of administering
this purgative in doses of a drachm and upwards in inflammatory
diseases. But it is nevertheless undeniable, that it has been
given to that extent in such circumstances, with no further consequence
than brisk purging. Professor Linoli mentions two cases of
inflammatory dropsy, in which he gave gamboge-powder in gradually
increasing doses, till he reached in one instance an entire
drachm, and in the other 86 grains. In the course of a month one
of his patients got 1044 grains, and the other took 850 grains in
twelve days. Both recovered from their dropsy, and the purging was
never great.<a id='r1473' /><a href='#f1473' class='c013'><sup>[1473]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Daffodil.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The common <i>daffodil</i>, the <i>Narcissus pseudo-narcissus</i> of botanists,
though commonly arranged with the vegetable acrids, seems not entitled
to a place among them. At least the experiments of Orfila
rather tend to show that it acts through absorption on the nervous
system. Four drachms of the aqueous extract of this plant secured
in the stomach in the usual way killed a dog in less than twenty-four
hours; and one drachm applied to a wound killed another in six
hours. In both cases vomiting or efforts to vomit seemed the only
symptom of note; and in both the stomach was found here and there
cherry-red. The wound was not much inflamed.<a id='r1474' /><a href='#f1474' class='c013'><sup>[1474]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Jalap.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'><i>Jalap</i>, the powder of the root of the <i>Ipomæa purga</i>, and a common
purgative, is an active poison in large doses; and this every one
should know, as severe and even dangerous effects have followed its
incautious use in the hands of the practical joker. Its active properties
reside in a particular resinous principle. It contains a tenth of
its weight of mixed resin, which, like the resin of euphorbium, has
been separated by Drs. Buchner and Herberger into two, one possessing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>some of the properties of acids, the other some of the properties
of bases; and the latter they consider the active principle,
and have accordingly named Jalapine.<a id='r1475' /><a href='#f1475' class='c013'><sup>[1475]</sup></a> Mr. Hume of London some
time ago procured from the crude drug a powdery substance, to which
he gave the same name, and which he conceived to be the active
principle. His analysis has not been generally relied on by chemists;
but it is not improbable that his principle differs little from that of the
German chemists.</p>

<p class='c006'>The action of jalap has been examined scientifically by M. Felix
Cadet de Gassicourt, who found that it produced no particular symptom
when injected into the jugular vein of a dog in the dose of
twenty-four grains, or when applied to the cellular tissue in the dose
of a drachm. But when rubbed daily into the skin of the belly and
thighs it excited in a few days severe dysentery; when introduced
into the pleura it excited pleurisy, fatal in three days; when introduced
into the peritonæum it caused peritonitis and violent dysentery,
fatal in six days; and when introduced into the stomach or the
anus, the animals died of profuse purging in four or five days, and
the stomach and intestines were then found red and sometimes ulcerated.
Two drachms administered by the mouth proved fatal.<a id='r1476' /><a href='#f1476' class='c013'><sup>[1476]</sup></a>
<i>Scammony</i>, which is procured from another species of the same
family, the <i>Convolvulus scammonea</i>, has been found by Orfila to be
much less active. Four drachms given to dogs produced only
diarrhœa.<a id='r1477' /><a href='#f1477' class='c013'><sup>[1477]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Savin.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The leaves of the <i>Juniperus sabina</i>, or savin, have been long
known to be poisonous. They have a peculiar heavy, rather disagreeable
odour, and a bitter, acrid, aromatic, somewhat resinous
taste. They yield an essential oil, which possesses all their qualities
in an eminent degree.</p>

<p class='c006'>A dog was killed by six drachms of the powdered leaves confined
in the stomach. It appeared to suffer pain, died in sixteen hours,
and exhibited on dissection only trivial redness of the stomach.
Two drachms introduced into a wound of the thigh caused death after
the manner of the other vegetable acrids in two days; and besides
inflammation of the limb there was found redness of the rectum.<a id='r1478' /><a href='#f1478' class='c013'><sup>[1478]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Savin is a good deal used in medicine for stimulating old ulcers
and keeping open blistered surfaces; which may be done without
danger, although it cannot be applied to a fresh wound without risk
of diffuse inflammation. Both the powder and the essential oil are
of some consequence in a medico-legal point of view, as they have
been often used with the intent of procuring abortion. The oil is
generally believed by the vulgar to possess this property in a peculiar
degree. Doubts, however, may be entertained whether any such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>property exists independently of its operation as a violent acrid on the
bowels. It has certainly been taken to a considerable amount without
the intended effect; of which Foderé has noticed an unequivocal example.
The woman took daily for twenty days no less than a hundred
drops of the oil, yet carried her child to the full time.<a id='r1479' /><a href='#f1479' class='c013'><sup>[1479]</sup></a> The
powder has likewise been taken to a large extent without avail. A
female, whose case is noticed by Foderé, took without her knowledge
so much of the powder that she was attacked with vomiting,
hiccup, heat in the lower belly, and fever of a fortnight’s duration;
nevertheless she was not delivered till the natural time.<a id='r1480' /><a href='#f1480' class='c013'><sup>[1480]</sup></a> There is
no doubt, however, that if given in such quantity as to cause violent
purging, abortion may ensue; but unless there is naturally a predisposition
to miscarriage, the constitutional injury and intestinal irritation
required to induce it are so great, as to be always attended
with extreme danger, independent of the uterine disorder. Of this
train of effects the following case, for which I am indebted to Mr.
Cockson of Macclesfield, is a good illustration. A female applied to
a pedlar to supply her with the means of getting rid of her pregnancy:
and under his direction appears to have taken a large quantity
of a strong infusion of savin-leaves on a Friday morning and
again next morning. A very imperfect account was obtained of the
symptoms, as no medical man witnessed them; but it was ascertained
that she had violent pain in the belly and distressing strangury.
On the Sunday afternoon she miscarried; and on the ensuing Thursday
she died. Mr. Cockson, who examined the body next day,
found extensive peritonæal inflammation unequivocally indicated by
the effusion of fibrinous flakes,—the uterus presenting all the signs
of recent delivery,—the inside of the stomach of a red tint, checkered
with patches of florid extravasation,—and its contents of a greenish
colour, owing evidently to the presence of a vegetable powder, as
was proved by separating and examining it with the microscope.
My colleague Dr. Traill has communicated to me the particulars of
a similar case. A servant-girl, after being for some time in low
spirits, was seized with violent colic pains, frequent vomiting, straining
at stool, tenderness of the belly, dysuria and general fever;
under which symptoms she died after several days of suffering. The
stomach was inflamed, in parts black, and at the lower curvature
perforated. The uterus with its appendages was very red, and contained
a fine <i>membrana decidua</i>, but no ovum. The lower intestines
were inflamed. There was found in the stomach a greenish powder,
which, when washed and dried, had the taste of savin.</p>

<p class='c006'>A singular case is quoted by Wibmer of a woman who died from
taking an infusion of the herb for the purpose of procuring miscarriage,
and in whom death seems to have been occasioned by the
gall-bladder bursting in consequence of the violent fits of vomiting.<a id='r1481' /><a href='#f1481' class='c013'><sup>[1481]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In a charge of wilful abortion the mere possession of oil of savin
would be a suspicious circumstance, because the notion that it has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>the power of causing miscarriage is very general among the vulgar;
while it is scarcely employed by them for any useful purpose. The
leaves in the form of infusion are in some parts of England a popular
remedy for worms; and the oil is used in regular medicine as an
emmenagogue.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following list includes all the other plants which have been
either ascertained experimentally to belong to the present order, or
are believed on good general evidence to possess the same or analogous
properties.</p>

<p class='c006'>By careful experiment Orfila has ascertained that the Gratiola
officinalis, Rhus radicans and Rhus toxicodendron, Chelidonium majus
and Sedum acre, possess them; and the following species are also
generally considered acrid, namely, Rhododendron chrysanthum and
ferrugineum, Pedicularis palustris, Cyclamen Europæum, Plumbago
Europæa, Pastinaca sativa, Lobelia syphilitica and longiflora, Hydrocotyle
vulgaris. To these may be added the common elder or Sambucus
nigra, the leaves and flowers of which caused in a boy, once
a patient of mine, dangerous inflammation of the mucous membrane
of the bowels lasting for eight days.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING WITH CANTHARIDES.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>The second group of the present Order of poisons comprehends
most of those derived from the animal kingdom. In action they
resemble considerably the vegetable acrids, their most characteristic
effect being local inflammation; but several of them also induce
symptoms of an injury of the nervous system.</p>

<p class='c006'>This group includes cantharides, poisonous fishes, venomous serpents,
and decayed or diseased animal matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first of these is familiarly known as a poison even to the common
people. I am not aware that it has ever been used for the purpose
of committing murder. But on account of its powerful effect
on the organs of generation it has often been given by way of joke,
and sometimes taken for the purpose of procuring abortion. Fatal
accidents have been the consequence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The appearance of the fly is well known. When in powder, as
generally seen, it has a grayish-green colour, mingled with brilliant
green points. It has a nauseous odour and a very acrid burning
taste. Alcohol dissolves its active principle. This principle appears
from a careful analysis by M. Robiquet to be a white, crystalline,
scaly substance, insoluble in water, but soluble in alcohol as
well as in oils, and termed cantharidin.<a id='r1482' /><a href='#f1482' class='c013'><sup>[1482]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In compound mixtures cantharides may generally be detected by
the green colour and metallic brilliancy even of its finest powder, if
examined in the sunshine—and sometimes by making an etherial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>extract of the suspected matter, and producing with this extract the
usual effects of a blister on a tender part of the arm. By these two
tests Barruel discovered cantharides in chocolate cakes, part of which
had been wickedly administered to various individuals.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the late important researches of M. Poumet<a id='r1483' /><a href='#f1483' class='c013'><sup>[1483]</sup></a> it appears, that
cantharides cannot be detected by its chemical properties in the contents,
or on the inner surface, of the alimentary canal of animals
poisoned with it; and that in such circumstances it is seldom to be
discerned even by the shining green colour of its particles, unless
the matter to be examined be dried. The method he recommends
for a medico-legal investigation is to detach the stomach, small intestines,
and great intestines, each separately from the body,—to
wash out their contents with rectified spirit, and dry the pulpy fluid
on sheets of glass,—to dry the stomach and intestines by distending
them, removing their mesentery, and hanging them up vertically
with a weight attached to stretch them,—and then to examine both
the surface of the glass, and the inside of the stomach and intestines
with the aid of sunshine or a bright artificial light. In this way cantharides
may be detected, by the peculiar green hue of its powder,
in most cases where this poison may have proved fatal; for M.
Poumet constantly found it in dogs. The same author ascertained
that the green particles generally abound most in the contents of the
great intestine or on its inner membrane, next in the small intestines,
and least of all in the stomach; and that they may be seen in the
bodies of animals at least seven months after interment. Orfila had
previously ascertained, that cantharides powder may be recognized
by its brilliancy in various organic mixtures after interment for nine
months.<a id='r1484' /><a href='#f1484' class='c013'><sup>[1484]</sup></a> Poumet farther states that the green particles of cantharides
may be confounded with the particles of other coleopterous
insects, and also somewhat resemble particles of copper and tin.
But he with reason asks, what possible accident could introduce the
powder of any other coleopterous insect into the alimentary canal?
And as to particles of copper or tin, he ascertained, that, unlike cantharides,
these substances are visible in the contents, or on the tissues,
of the stomach and intestines only before desiccation, and
never after it.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section I.</span>—<i>Of the Action of Cantharides and the Symptoms it excites in Man.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Cantharides, either in the form of powder, tincture, or oily solution,
is an active poison both to man and animals. As to its action
on animals, Orfila found that a drachm and a half of a strong oleaginous
solution, injected into the jugular vein of a dog, killed it in
four hours with symptoms of violent tetanus; that three drachms of
the tincture with eight grains of powder suspended in it caused
death in twenty-four hours, if retained in the stomach by a ligature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>on the gullet,—insensibility being then the chief symptom; and
that forty grains of the powder killed another dog in four hours and
a half, although he was allowed to vomit. In all the instances in
which it was administered by the stomach, that organ was found
much inflamed after death; and generally fragments of the poison
were discernible if it was given in the form of powder. When applied
to a wound the powder excites surrounding inflammation; and
a drachm will in this way prove fatal in thirty-two hours without any
particular constitutional symptom except languor.<a id='r1485' /><a href='#f1485' class='c013'><sup>[1485]</sup></a> M. Poumet has
since obtained results not materially different.</p>

<p class='c006'>These experiments do not furnish any satisfactory proof of the absorption
of the poison, but rather tend to show that it does not enter
the blood. Such a conclusion, however, must not be too hastily
drawn; since its well-known effects on man when used in the form
of a blister lead to the conclusion that it is absorbed, and that it produces
its peculiar effect on the urinary system through the medium
of the circulation. On account of the magnitude of the dose required
to produce severe effects on animals, Orfila’s experiments on the
stomach and external surface of the body cannot, for reasons formerly
assigned (<a href='#Page_452'>452</a>) be properly compared together.</p>

<p class='c006'>The effect of cantharides, when admitted directly into the blood,
seems much less than might be expected. Mr. Blake found that an
infusion of two drachms injected into the jugular vein of a dog,
caused some difficulty of breathing, irregularity of the pulse, and diminished
arterial pressure, but apparently no great inconvenience to
the animal.<a id='r1486' /><a href='#f1486' class='c013'><sup>[1486]</sup></a> The greater effect observed in Orfila’s experiment was
probably owing to obstruction of the pulmonary capillaries by the oil.</p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila has examined with care not only the preparations of cantharides
already mentioned, but likewise the various principles procured
by M. Robiquet during his analysis; and it appears to result, that
the active properties of the fly reside partly in the crystalline principle,
and partly in a volatile oil, which is the source of its nauseous
odour.</p>

<p class='c006'>The symptoms produced by cantharides in man are more remarkable
than those observed in animals. A great number of cases are on
record; but few have been minutely related. Sometimes it has been
swallowed for the purpose of self-destruction, sometimes for procuring
miscarriage. But most frequently, on account of a prevalent notion
that it possesses aphrodisiac properties, it has been both voluntarily
swallowed and secretly administered, to excite the venereal appetite.
That it has this effect in many instances cannot be doubted. But the
old stories, which have been the cause of its being so frequently used
for the purpose, are many of them fabulous, and all exaggerated.
Often no venereal appetite is excited, sometimes even no affection of
the urinary or genital organs at all; and the kidneys and bladder may
be powerfully affected without the genital organs participating. It is
established, too, by frequent observation, that the excitement of the
genital organs can never be induced, without other violent constitutional
symptoms being also brought on, to the great hazard of life.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>The following abstract of a case by M. Biett of Paris gives a rational
and unexaggerated account of the symptoms as they commonly
appear. A young man, in consequence of a trick of his companions,
took a drachm of the powder. Soon afterwards he was seized with
a sense of burning in the throat and stomach; and in about an hour
with violent pain in the lower belly. When M. Biett saw him, his
voice was feeble, breathing laborious, and pulse contracted; and he
had excessive thirst, but could not swallow any liquid without unutterable
anguish. He was likewise affected with priapism. The
pain then became more extensive and severe, tenesmus and strangury
were added to the symptoms, and after violent efforts he succeeded
in passing by the anus and urethra only a few drops of blood. By
the use of oily injections into the anus and bladder, together with a
variety of other remedies intended to allay the general irritation of
the mucous membranes, he was considerably relieved before the
second day; but even then he continued to complain of great heat
along the whole course of the alimentary canal, occasionally priapism,
and difficult micturition. For some months he laboured under difficulty
of swallowing.<a id='r1487' /><a href='#f1487' class='c013'><sup>[1487]</sup></a>—Another case very similar in its circumstances
has been related by M. Rouquayrol. In addition to the
symptoms observed in Biett’s patient there was much salivation, and
towards the close of the second day a large cylindrical mass, apparently
the inner membrane of the gullet, was discharged by vomiting.<a id='r1488' /><a href='#f1488' class='c013'><sup>[1488]</sup></a>—A
case of the same kind, but less severe, is related in the Medical
Gazette. A woman, who had taken an ounce of the tincture, was
observed throughout the day to be apparently intoxicated. Next
morning, when she for the first time told what she had done, she had
excruciating pain, great tenderness and distension of the belly, a
flushed anxious countenance, a dry, pale tongue, a natural pulse,
and urine loaded with sediment and fibrinous matter. In the evening
there was extreme weakness, cold extremities, a scarcely perceptible
pulse, and retention of urine; and at night she was delirious. After
this she recovered progressively, the chief symptoms then being pain in
the kidneys and inability to pass urine.<a id='r1489' /><a href='#f1489' class='c013'><sup>[1489]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Among the symptoms the affection of the throat, causing difficult
deglutition and even an aversion to liquids, appears to be pretty constant.
The sense of irritation along the gullet and in the stomach is
also generally considerable. Sometimes it is attended with bloody
vomiting, as in four cases related by Dr. Graaf of Langenburg;<a id='r1490' /><a href='#f1490' class='c013'><sup>[1490]</sup></a> and
at other times, as in the instance of poisoning with the acids, there
is vomiting of membranous flakes. These have been mistaken
for the lining membrane of the alimentary canal, but are really in
general a morbid secretion.<a id='r1491' /><a href='#f1491' class='c013'><sup>[1491]</sup></a> At the same time there is reason to
believe that a portion of the membrane of the gullet was discharged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>in Rouquayrol’s case; for there were ramified vessels in it, and one
so large that blood issued on pricking it. A prominent symptom in
general is distressing strangury, and it commonly concurs with suppression
of urine and the discharge of blood.<a id='r1492' /><a href='#f1492' class='c013'><sup>[1492]</sup></a> It would appear that,
when the genital organs are much affected, the inflammation may run
on to gangrene of the external parts. Ambrose Paré notices a fatal
instance of the kind, which was caused by a young woman seasoning
comfits for her lover with cantharides.<a id='r1493' /><a href='#f1493' class='c013'><sup>[1493]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The preceding symptoms are occasionally united with signs of an
injury of the nervous system. Headache is common, and delirium
is sometimes associated with it.<a id='r1494' /><a href='#f1494' class='c013'><sup>[1494]</sup></a> In a case communicated to Orfila
the leading symptoms at first were strangury and bloody urine; but
these were soon followed by violent convulsions and occasional loss
of recollection.<a id='r1495' /><a href='#f1495' class='c013'><sup>[1495]</sup></a> The quantity in that instance was only eight grains;
and it was taken for the purpose of self-destruction. In one of
Graaf’s four cases the patient was attacked during convalescence
with violent phrensy of three days’ continuance.<a id='r1496' /><a href='#f1496' class='c013'><sup>[1496]</sup></a> An instance is
also related in the Transactions of the Turin Academy, of tetanic
convulsions and hydrophobia appearing three days after a small over-dose
of the tincture of cantharides was taken, and continuing for
several days with extreme violence.<a id='r1497' /><a href='#f1497' class='c013'><sup>[1497]</sup></a> The cause of the symptoms,
however, is here doubtful.</p>

<p class='c006'>A rare occurrence is relapse after apparent convalescence. In a
case communicated to me by Dr. Osborne of Dundee, which there
was every reason to believe had arisen from cantharides administered
to a girl by an unprincipled scoundrel, the usual symptoms of violent
irritation in the bladder and rectum prevailed for 36 hours; and
an interval of quiet and apparent convalescence ensued for three
days. But on the fifth day the urinary symptoms returned, and were
attended with great prostration, a rapid feeble pulse, and severe
diarrhœa for two days longer. She eventually recovered. Another
girl, poisoned at the same time, had most distressing irritation in the
bladder, and for some time passed nothing but drops of blood; but
she got well in two days, and had no relapse.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following fatal cases deserve particular mention. Orfila quotes
one from the <i>Gazette de Santé</i> for May, 1819, which was caused by
two doses of twenty-four grains taken with the interval of a day between
them, for the purpose of suicide. The ordinary symptoms of
irritation in the bowels and urinary organs ensued, miscarriage then
took place, and the patient died on the fourth day, with dilated
pupils and convulsive motions, but with unimpaired sensibility.<a id='r1498' /><a href='#f1498' class='c013'><sup>[1498]</sup></a>
Another instance related by Dr. Ives of the United States, presented
two stages, like that related by Orfila, but with the remarkable difference
that an interval of several days intervened between the irritant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>and narcotic effects. A man swallowed an ounce of the tincture
and was seized in a short time with hurried breathing, flushed face,
redness of the eyes and lacrymation, convulsive twitches, pain in the
stomach and bladder, suppression of urine and priapism; in the
evening delirium set in, and next morning there was loss of consciousness;
but from this time under the use of blood-letting, emetics,
blisters, sinapisms, and castor-oil, he got well and continued so for
fourteen days. But after that interval he was suddenly attacked
with headache and shivering, then with convulsions, and subsequently
with coma; which, however, was removed for a time by outward counter-irritants.
Next day the coma returned at intervals, and on the subsequent
day the convulsions also, which gradually increased in severity
for three days more, and then proved fatal.<a id='r1499' /><a href='#f1499' class='c013'><sup>[1499]</sup></a> In this case it admits
of question whether the affection which proved the immediate cause
of death really arose from the cantharides, or was an independent
disease.—A third case, fatal on the fourth day, occurred in April,
1830, near Uxbridge in the south of England. I have not been able
to learn the particulars exactly; but it appears to have been produced
by cantharides powder, which was mixed with beer by two
scoundrels at a dancing party for the purpose of exciting the venereal
appetite of the females. A large party of young men and women were
in consequence taken severely ill; and one girl died, who had been
prevailed on to take the powder at the bottom of the vessel, on being
assured that it was ginger.</p>

<p class='c006'>The quantity of the powder or tincture requisite to prove fatal or
dangerous has not been accurately settled. Indeed practitioners differ
much even as to the proper medicinal doses. The smallest dose of
the powder yet known was twenty-four grains (Orfila); and the
smallest fatal dose of the tincture was one ounce, which is equivalent
to six grains of powder.<a id='r1500' /><a href='#f1500' class='c013'><sup>[1500]</sup></a> It is probable that this is one of the
poisons whose operation is liable to be materially affected by idiosyncrasy.
The medicinal dose is from half a grain to two grains of the
powder, and from ten drops to two drachms of the tincture. But Dr. Beck
has quoted an instance where six ounces of the tincture were taken
without injury.<a id='r1501' /><a href='#f1501' class='c013'><sup>[1501]</sup></a> On the other hand Werlhoff has mentioned the
case of a lad who used to be attacked with erection and involuntary emission
on merely smelling the powder.<a id='r1502' /><a href='#f1502' class='c013'><sup>[1502]</sup></a> This statement, though extraordinary,
is not without support from the parallel effects of other substances.</p>

<p class='c006'>The familiar effects of cantharides on the external surface of the
body are not unattended with danger, if extensive, or induced in particular
states of the constitution. An ordinary blistered surface often
ulcerates in febrile diseases; and in the typhoid state which characterizes
certain fevers, this ulceration has been known to pass on to
fatal sloughing, especially when the blister has been applied to parts
on which the body rests. I have met with two such cases. On the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>other hand if the blistered surface be very extensive, death may take
place in the primary stage of the local affection, in consequence of
the great constitutional disturbance excited. Thus in 1841 a girl,
affected with scabies, received cantharides ointment by mistake instead
of sulphur ointment from an hospital-serjeant at Windsor Barracks;
and having anointed nearly her whole body with it, was
seized with violent burning pain of the integuments, followed by
vesication, general fever, and the usual symptoms of the action of this
poison on the urinary organs. These effects were so severe that she
died in five days.<a id='r1503' /><a href='#f1503' class='c013'><sup>[1503]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section II.</span>—<i>Of the Morbid Appearances caused by Cantharides.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The only precise account I have hitherto seen of the morbid appearances
caused by cantharides is contained in the history of the
case from the <i>Gazette de Santé</i>. The brain was gorged with blood.
The omentum, peritonæum, gullet, stomach, intestines, kidneys,
ureters, and internal parts of generation were inflamed; and the
mouth and tongue were stripped of their lining membrane.—In dogs
Schubarth observed, besides the usual signs of inflammation in the
alimentary canal, great redness of the tubular part of the kidneys, redness
and extravasated patches on the inside of the bladder, and redness
of the ureters as well as of the urethra.<a id='r1504' /><a href='#f1504' class='c013'><sup>[1504]</sup></a> M. Poumet denies that
any morbid appearance is ever found in any part of the genito-urinary
organs of animals; but he sometimes found blood effused into
the stomach and intestines.<a id='r1505' /><a href='#f1505' class='c013'><sup>[1505]</sup></a> In Dr. Ives’s case the blood-vessels of
the brain and cerebellum were gorged, the cerebellum spread over
with lymph, the villous coat of the stomach softened and brittle, and
the kidneys inflamed and presenting blood in their pelvis.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the case has been rapid, the remains of the powder may be
found in the stomach or intestines by Poumet’s process. From the
researches of Orfila and Lesueur, confirmed by those of Poumet, it appears
not to undergo decomposition for a long time when mixed with
decaying animal matters. After nine months’ interment the resplendent
green points continue brilliant.<a id='r1506' /><a href='#f1506' class='c013'><sup>[1506]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section III.</span>—<i>Of the Treatment of Poisoning with Cantharides.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The treatment of poisoning with cantharides is not well established.
No antidote has yet been discovered. At one time fixed oil was believed
to be an excellent remedy. But the experiments of Robiquet
on the active principle of the poison, and those of Orfila on the effects
of its oleaginous solution, rather prove that oil is the reverse of an
antidote. The case mentioned in the Genoa Memoirs was evidently
exacerbated<a id='t476'></a> by the use of oil. When the accident is discovered early
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>enough, and vomiting has not already begun, emetics may be given;
and if vomiting has begun, it is to be encouraged. Oleaginous and
demulcent injections into the bladder generally relieve the strangury.
The warm bath is a useful auxiliary. Leeches and blood-letting are required,
according as the degree and stage of the inflammation may
seem to indicate.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many other insects besides the <i>Cantharis vesicatoria</i> possess similar
acrid properties. Two of them, however, may be briefly alluded to,
because they have caused fatal poisoning. The one is the <i>Meloë
proscarabæus</i>, the <i>Maiwurm</i> of the Germans, a native of most
European countries. In Rust’s Magazin there is an account of four
persons who took the powder of this insect from a quack for spasms
in the stomach. The principal symptoms were stifling and vomiting;
and two of the people died within twenty-four hours.<a id='r1507' /><a href='#f1507' class='c013'><sup>[1507]</sup></a> The other
is the <i>Bombyx</i>, of which at least two species are believed to possess
powerful irritant properties, the <i>B. pityocarpa</i> and <i>B. processionea</i>.
The following is an instance of their effects. A child ten years old
had a common blister applied to the neck and spine as a remedy for
deafness; and four days afterwards her mother dressed the abraded
skin with the leaves of beet-root, from which she had previously shaken a
great number of caterpillars. The child soon complained of insupportable
itching and burning in the part, and endeavoured to tear off the dressings.
The mother persevered, however; and her child died in two
days of gangrene of the whole integuments of the back. The surgeon
who saw the child on the last day of her life, ascribed the gangrene
to the insects mentioned above, and states that they possess the
power of exciting erysipelas when applied even to the sound skin.<a id='r1508' /><a href='#f1508' class='c013'><sup>[1508]</sup></a> It
is probable that many other insects in Europe have similar properties.
The <i>Mylabris cichorii</i>, which is partially used in Italy,<a id='r1509' /><a href='#f1509' class='c013'><sup>[1509]</sup></a> and is in
common use in India and China for blistering, possesses active irritant
properties. The <i>Cantharis ruficollis</i>, another species used in
the Nizam’s Territories in India, is also energetic. Other species
known to possess activity are <i>Mylabris fusselini</i>, <i>Meloe majalis</i>, <i>M.
trianthemum</i>, <i>Coccinella bipunctata</i>, <i>C. septem-punctata</i>, and <i>Cantharis
vittata</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXII.<br /> <span class='small'>OF THE DELETERIOUS EFFECTS OF POISONOUS FISH.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>The species of fish which act deleteriously, either always or in
particular circumstances, have also been commonly arranged in the
present order of poisons.</p>

<p class='c006'>The subject of fish-poison is one of the most singular in the
whole range of toxicology, and none is at present veiled in so great
obscurity. It is well ascertained that some species of fish, particularly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>in hot climates, are always poisonous,—that some, though generally
salubrious and nutritive, such as the oyster and still more the
muscle, will at times acquire properties which render them hurtful
to all who eat them,—and that others, such as the shell-fish now
mentioned, and even the richer sorts of vertebrated fishes, though
actually eaten with perfect safety by mankind in general, are nevertheless
poisonous, either at all times or only occasionally to particular
individuals. But hitherto the chemist and the physiologist have
in vain attempted to discover the cause of their deleterious operation.</p>

<p class='c006'>A good account of the poisonous fishes of the tropics has been
given by Dr. Chisholm<a id='r1510' /><a href='#f1510' class='c013'><sup>[1510]</sup></a> and by Dr. Thomas;<a id='r1511' /><a href='#f1511' class='c013'><sup>[1511]</sup></a> and some farther observations
on the same subject have been published by Dr. Fergusson.<a id='r1512' /><a href='#f1512' class='c013'><sup>[1512]</sup></a>
These essays may be consulted with advantage. On the effects of
poisonous muscles several interesting notices and essays have been
written, among which may be particularized one by Dr. Burrows<a id='r1513' /><a href='#f1513' class='c013'><sup>[1513]</sup></a> of
London, another by Dr. Combe of Leith,<a id='r1514' /><a href='#f1514' class='c013'><sup>[1514]</sup></a> and the observations of
Professor Orfila, including some cases from the Gazette de Santé, and
from the private practice of Dr. Edwards.<a id='r1515' /><a href='#f1515' class='c013'><sup>[1515]</sup></a> Of all the sources of
information now mentioned, that which appears to me the most comprehensive
and precise, is the essay of Dr. Combe, who has collected
many facts previously known, added others equal in number and importance
to all the rest put together, and weighed with impartiality
the various inferences which have been or may be drawn from them.
The succeeding remarks will be confined to a succinct statement of
what appears well established.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this work, however, the poisonous fishes of the West Indies
and other tropical countries may be laid aside, because we are still too
little acquainted with the phenomena of their action to be entitled to
investigate its cause, and they are objects of much less interest to the
British medical jurist than the fish-poison of his own coast.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is little doubt that some of the inhabitants of the sea on the
coast of Britain are always poisonous. Thus it is well known that
some of the molluscous species irritate and inflame the skin wherever
they touch it,—a fact which is familiar to every experienced swimmer.
The fishermen of the English coast are also aware that a small
fish known by the name of Weever (<i>Trachinus vipera</i>, Cuv.) possesses
the power of stinging with its dorsal fin so violently as to produce
immediate numbness of the arm or leg, succeeded rapidly by
considerable swelling and redness; and indeed an instance of this accident,
which happened at Portobello on the Firth of Forth, has
been mentioned to me by Mr. Stark, author of the Elements of Natural
History, who witnessed the effects of the poison. But our
knowledge of the poisons of that class is too imperfect to require
more particular notice.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>Of fishes which are commonly nutritive, but sometimes acquire
poisonous properties, by far the most remarkable is the common
<i>Muscle</i>. Opportunities have often occurred for observing its effects,—so
often, indeed, that its occasional poisonous qualities have become
an important topic of medical police, and in some parts, as in
the neighbourhood of Edinburgh and Leith, it has of late been abandoned
by many people as an article of food, although generally relished,
and in most circumstances undoubtedly safe. This result
originated in an accident at Leith in 1827, by which no fewer than
thirty people were severely affected and two killed.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of the Symptoms and Morbid Appearances caused by Poisonous Muscles.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The effects of poisonous muscles differ in different cases. Sometimes
they have produced symptoms of local irritation only. Thus
Foderé mentions the case of a sailor in Marseilles, who, in consequence
of eating a large dish of them, died in two days, after suffering
from vomiting, nausea, pain in the stomach, tenesmus, and quick
contracted pulse. The stomach and intestines were found after
death red and lined with an abundant tough mucus.<a id='r1516' /><a href='#f1516' class='c013'><sup>[1516]</sup></a> One of the
cases described by Dr. Combe, which, however, terminated favourably,
is of the same nature. The patient had severe stomach symptoms
from the commencement, attended with cramps and ending in
peritonitis, which required the frequent use of the lancet.</p>

<p class='c006'>But much more commonly the local effects have been trifling, and
the prominent symptoms have been almost entirely indirect and
chiefly nervous. Two affections of this kind have been noticed.
One is an eruptive disease resembling nettle-rash, and accompanied
with violent asthma; the other a comatose or paralytic disorder of a
peculiar description.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of the former affection several good examples have been recorded
in different numbers of the Gazette de Santé.<a id='r1517' /><a href='#f1517' class='c013'><sup>[1517]</sup></a> In these the number
of muscles eaten was generally small; in one instance ten, in another
only six. Nay, in a case related with several others by Möhring in
the German Ephemerides, the patient only chewed one muscle and
swallowed the fluid part, having spit out the muscle itself.<a id='r1518' /><a href='#f1518' class='c013'><sup>[1518]</sup></a> The
symptoms have usually commenced between one and two hours after
eating, and rapidly attained their greatest intensity. In the patient
who was affected by ten muscles the first symptoms were like those
of violent coryza; swelling and itching of the eyelids, and general
nettle-rash followed; and the eruption afterwards gave place to
symptoms of urgent asthma, which were removed by ether. In
other cases the symptoms of asthma preceded the eruption. In one
instance the eruption did not appear at all. The swelling has not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>been always confined to the eyelids, but, on the contrary, has usually
extended over the whole face. All the patients were quickly
relieved by ether. The eruption, though generally called nettle-rash,
is sometimes papular, sometimes vesicular, but always attended with
tormenting heat and itchiness. Several cases of this kind have been
related by Möhring. The eruption was preceded by dyspnœa, lividity
of the face, insensibility, and convulsive movements of the extremities.
All recovered under the use of emetics.<a id='r1519' /><a href='#f1519' class='c013'><sup>[1519]</sup></a> This affection, however,
may prove fatal. In the cases of two children related by Dr.
Burrows, the symptoms began, as in Möhring’s cases, with dyspnœa,
nettle-rash, and swelling of the face, combined with vomiting and
colic; but afterwards the leading symptoms were delirium, convulsions,
and coma; and death took place in three days.</p>

<p class='c006'>In these children it is worthy of remark, that none of the symptoms
began till twenty-four hours after eating. In Möhring’s cases, on the
contrary, the symptoms began in a few minutes.</p>

<p class='c006'>The other affection is well exemplified in the correct delineations of
Dr. Combe. The following is his general summary of the cases, which,
with the exception of the instance of peritonitis already alluded to,
were all singularly alike in their leading features.—“None, so far as
I know, complained of anything peculiar in the smell or taste of the
animals, and none suffered immediately after taking them. In general,
an hour or two elapsed, sometimes more; and then the bad effects
consisted rather in uneasy feelings and debility, than in any distress
referable to the stomach. Some children suffered from eating only
two or three; and it will be remembered that Robertson, a young and
healthy man, only took five or six. In two or three hours they complained
of a slight tension at the stomach. One or two had cardialgia,
nausea, and vomiting; but these were not general or lasting
symptoms. They then complained of a prickly feeling in their hands;
heat and constriction of the mouth and throat; difficulty of swallowing
and speaking freely; numbness about the mouth, gradually extending
to the arms, with great debility of the limbs. The degree of
muscular debility varied a good deal, but was an invariable symptom.
In some it merely prevented them from walking firmly, but in
most of them it amounted to perfect inability to stand. While in bed
they could move their limbs with tolerable freedom; but on being
raised to the perpendicular posture, they felt their limbs sink under
them. Some complained of a bad coppery taste in the mouth, but in
general this was an answer to what lawyers call a leading question.
There was slight pain of the abdomen, increased on pressure, particularly
in the region of the bladder, which suffered variously in its
functions. In some the secretion of urine was suspended, in others it
was free, but passed with pain and great effort. The action of the heart
was feeble; the breathing unaffected; the face pale, expressive of
much anxiety; the surface rather cold; the mental faculties unimpaired.
Unluckily the two fatal cases were not seen by any medical person;
and we are therefore unable to state minutely the train of symptoms.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>We ascertained that the woman, in whose house were five sufferers,
went away as in a gentle sleep; and that a few minutes before death,
she had spoken and swallowed.”<a id='r1520' /><a href='#f1520' class='c013'><sup>[1520]</sup></a> She died in three hours. The
other fatal case was that of a dock-yard watchman, who was found
dead in his box six or seven hours after he ate the muscles.</p>

<p class='c006'>The inspection of the bodies threw no light on the nature of these
singular effects. No appearance was found which could be called
decidedly morbid. The stomach contained a considerable quantity
of the fish half digested.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Combe’s narrative agrees with that of Vancouver, four of whose
sailors were violently affected, and one killed in five hours and a half,
after eating muscles which they had gathered on shore in the course
of his voyage of discovery.<a id='r1521' /><a href='#f1521' class='c013'><sup>[1521]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In closing this account, allusion may be briefly made to a case
related by Dr. Edwards, which differs from all the preceding.
The symptoms were uneasiness at stomach, followed by epileptic
convulsions, which did not entirely cease for a fortnight. Dr.
Edwards imputed the illness to muscles; but it must be observed
that this is a solitary instance of simple convulsions arising from such
a cause.<a id='r1522' /><a href='#f1522' class='c013'><sup>[1522]</sup></a> The case deserves particular attention, because a suspicion
of intentional poison might have been excited by the circumstances
in which it occurred. The individual, a young man, was attacked
soon after eating in company with another, who was about to marry
his mother, and with whom on that account he lived on bad terms.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of the Source of Poison of Muscles.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Various opinions have been formed as to the cause or causes of the
poisonous qualities of some muscles.</p>

<p class='c006'>The vulgar idea that the poisonous principle is copper, with which
the fish becomes impregnated from the copper bottoms of vessels, is
quite untenable. Copper does not cause the symptoms described
above. I analyzed some of the muscles taken from the stomach of
one of Dr. Combe’s patients, without being able to detect a trace of
copper. Others have arrived at the same result in former cases.
The only instance indeed to the contrary is a late analysis by M.
Bouchardat; who does not mention the quantity of copper he detected,
or what was the source of the poisonous fish.<a id='r1523' /><a href='#f1523' class='c013'><sup>[1523]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The theory which ascribes their effects to changes induced by decay
is equally untenable. In Dr. Burrows’s two cases the muscles appear
to have been decayed; yet he very properly refuses to admit this
fact as explanatory of their operation. And, indeed, it rather complicates
than facilitates the explanation; as it shows that the poison
differs from animal poison generally, in not being destroyed by
putrefaction. Dr. Combe’s inquiries must satisfy every one, that in
the Leith cases decay was out of the question, and I may add my
testimony to the statement: the muscles taken from the stomach of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>one of his fatal cases, and likewise others obtained in the shell, and
brought to me for analysis, were perfectly fresh.</p>

<p class='c006'>By some physicians, and especially by Dr. Edwards, their poisonous
effects have been referred to idiosyncrasy on the part of the
persons who suffer. It can hardly be doubted that this is the cause
in some instances. It was formerly mentioned that muscles, oysters,
crabs, and even the richer sorts of vertebrated fishes, such as trout,
salmon, turbot, holibut, herring, mackerel, are not only injurious to
some people, while salutary to mankind generally, but likewise that
this singular idiosyncrasy may be acquired. A relation of mine for
many years could not take a few mouthfuls of salmon, trout, herring,
turbot, holibut, crab, or lobster, without being attacked in a few
minutes or hours with violent vomiting; yet at an early period of
life, he could eat them all with impunity; and at all times he has
eaten without injury cod, ling, haddock, whiting, flounder, oysters,
and muscles. Among the cases which have come under Dr. Edwards’s
notice in Paris, there is one evidently of the same nature. In two
others, the idiosyncrasy existed in regard to the muscle, and although
in both of these the affection induced was slight, there is no doubt
but idiosyncrasy will also account even for some instances of the
severe disorders specified above. In particular, it appears sometimes
to operate in the production of nettle-rash and asthma; for in the
instance quoted from the Gazette de Santé, as arising from ten
muscles, it happened that the father of the patient partook very freely
of the same dish without sustaining any harm whatever; and in each
of three distinct accidents mentioned by Möhring, it appeared that
other individuals had eaten of the same dish with equal impunity.<a id='r1524' /><a href='#f1524' class='c013'><sup>[1524]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>But idiosyncrasy will not account for all the cases of poisoning
with muscles, oysters, and other fish. For, passing over other less
unequivocal objections, it appears that, when the accident related
above happened at Leith, every person who ate the muscles from a
particular spot was more or less severely affected; and an important
circumstance then observed for the first time was, that animals suffered
as severely as man, a cat and a dog having been killed by the
suspected article.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another theory ascribes the poisonous quality to disease in the fish;
but no one has hitherto pointed out what the disease is. The poisonous
muscles at Leith were large and plump, and seemed to have
been chosen on account of their size and good look. Dr. Coldstream,
however, at the time a pupil of this University, and a zealous naturalist,
thought the liver was larger, darker, and more brittle than in
the wholesome fish, and certainly satisfied me that there was a difference
of the kind. But whether this was really disease or merely a
variety of natural structure, our knowledge of the natural history of
the fish hardly entitles us to pronounce.</p>

<p class='c006'>Considering the failure of all other attempts to account for the injurious
properties acquired by muscles, it is extraordinary that no
experiments have been hitherto made with the view of discovering
in the poisonous fish a peculiar animal principle. It certainly seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>probable, that the property resides in a particular part of the fish or
in a particular principle. In 1827, I made some experiments on
those which caused the fatal accident at Leith, but without success.
My attention was turned particularly to the liver; but neither there
nor in the other parts of the fish could I detect any principle which
did not equally exist in the wholesome muscle. This result, however,
should not deter others, any more than it would myself, from a
fresh investigation; for the want of a sufficient supply prevented me
from making a thorough analysis; and the reader will presently find
an instance related, where another singular poison, sometimes contained
in sausages and in cheese, was, after repeated failures, at
length traced successfully to the real cause by the hand of the analytic
chemist.</p>

<p class='c006'>M. Lamouroux, in a letter to Professor Orfila, conjectures that the
poison may be a particular species of Medusa, and enters into some
ingenious explanations of his opinion. But it is not supported by any
material fact, and seems to be surrounded by insuperable difficulties.<a id='r1525' /><a href='#f1525' class='c013'><sup>[1525]</sup></a>
It is not a new conjecture; for Möhring mentions in his paper formerly
quoted, that several writers before him had conceived such a cause
might afford an explanation of the phenomena.<a id='r1526' /><a href='#f1526' class='c013'><sup>[1526]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Little or no light is thrown on this singular subject by the nature
of the localities in which the poisonous muscle has been found.
Even on this point we possess little information. Both in Dr. Burrows’s
and Dr. Combe’s cases the fish was attached to wood. At
Leith they were taken from some Memel fir logs, which formed the
bar of one of the wet-docks, and had lain there at least fifteen
years. From the stone-walls of the dock in the immediate vicinity
of this bar muscles were taken which proved quite wholesome. It
is impossible, however, to attach any importance to these facts; for
Dr. Coldstream informs me, that he examined muscles which were
attached to the fir piles of the Newhaven Chain-pier, about a mile
from Leith, and found them wholesome. In the latter animals the
liver was not large, as in the poisonous muscles of Leith. Lamouroux
states, but I know not on what authority, that muscles never
become poisonous unless they are exposed alternately to the air and
the sea in their place of attachment, and unless the sea flows in gently
over them without any surf,—these conditions being considered by
him requisite for the introduction of the poisonous Medusæ into the
shell.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisonous Oysters.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'><i>Oysters</i> sometimes acquire deleterious properties analogous to those
acquired by muscles. But fewer facts have been collected regarding
them. M. Pasquier has mentioned some cases which occurred not
long ago at Havre, in consequence apparently of an artificial oyster-bed
having been established near the exit of the drain of a public
necessary. But I have not been able to consult his work.<a id='r1527' /><a href='#f1527' class='c013'><sup>[1527]</sup></a> Another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>instance of their deleterious operation occurred a few years ago at
Dunkirk. At least an unusual prevalence of colic, diarrhœa, and
cholera was believed to have been traced to an importation of unwholesome
oysters from the Normandy coast. Dr. Zandyk, the physician
who was appointed to investigate the matter, found that the
suspected fish contained a slimy water, and that the membranes
were retracted from the shell towards the body of the animal.<a id='r1528' /><a href='#f1528' class='c013'><sup>[1528]</sup></a> Dr.
Clarke believes that even wholesome oysters have a tendency to act
deleteriously on women immediately after delivery. He asserts that
he has repeatedly found them to induce apoplexy or convulsions; that
the symptoms generally came on the day after the oysters were
taken; and that two cases of the kind proved fatal.<a id='r1529' /><a href='#f1529' class='c013'><sup>[1529]</sup></a> I am not
aware that these statements have been since confirmed by any other
observer.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisonous Eels.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'><i>Eels</i> have also been at times found in temperate climates to acquire
poisonous properties. Virey mentions an instance where several
individuals were attacked with violent tormina and diarrhœa a
few hours after eating a paté made of eels from a stagnant castle-ditch
near Orleans; and in alluding to similar accidents having previously
happened in various parts of France, he adds that domestic animals
have been killed by eating the remains of the suspected dish.<a id='r1530' /><a href='#f1530' class='c013'><sup>[1530]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING BY VENOMOUS SNAKES.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>Another entire group of poisons allied to the acrid vegetables in
their action, but infinitely more energetic, comprehends the poisons
of the venomous serpents. If we were to trust the impressions the
vulgar entertain of the effects of the bite of serpents, the poisons now
mentioned would be considered true septics or putrefiants; for they
were once universally believed, and are still thought by many, to
cause putrefaction of the living body. This property has been assigned
them probably on no other grounds, except that they are apt to
bring on diffuse subcutaneous inflammation, which frequently runs on
to gangrene. But there are some serpents, especially among those of
hot climates, which appear also to act remotely on the centre of the
nervous system, and to occasion death through means of that action.</p>

<p class='c006'>The present group of poisons is of little consequence to the British
medical jurist, as an opportunity of witnessing their effects in this
country is seldom to be found. The viper is the only poisonous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>snake known in Britain, where its poison is hardly ever so active as to
occasion death.<a id='r1531' /><a href='#f1531' class='c013'><sup>[1531]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>This serpent, like all the other poisonous species, is provided with
a peculiar apparatus by which the poison is secreted, preserved, and
introduced into the body of the animal it attacks. The apparatus
consists of a gland behind each eye, of a membranous sac at the lateral
and anterior part of the upper jaw, and of a hollow curved tooth
surrounded and supported by the sac. The cavity of the tooth communicates
with that of the sac, and terminates near the tip, in a small
aperture, by which the poison is expelled into the wound made by
the tooth.</p>

<p class='c006'>The symptoms caused by the bite of the viper are lancinating pain,
which begins between three minutes and forty minutes after the bite,
and rapidly stretches up the limbs,—swelling, at first firm and pale,
afterwards red, livid and hard,—tendency to fainting, bilious vomiting,
sometimes convulsions, more rarely jaundice,—quick, small,
irregular pulse,—difficult breathing, cold perspiration, dimness of
vision, and injury of the mental faculties. Death may ensue. A case
is related in Rust’s Magazin of a child twelve years old, who died
two days after being bitten in the foot;<a id='r1532' /><a href='#f1532' class='c013'><sup>[1532]</sup></a> another instance is briefly
noticed in the French Bulletins of Medicine, of a person forty years
old, dying also in two days;<a id='r1533' /><a href='#f1533' class='c013'><sup>[1533]</sup></a> Dr. Wagner of Schlieben mentions his
having met with two instances where persons bit on the toes died before
assistance could be procured;<a id='r1534' /><a href='#f1534' class='c013'><sup>[1534]</sup></a> and notice has been taken in Hufeland’s
Journal of a girl, eleven years old, having been killed in three hours
at Schlawe in Prussia.<a id='r1535' /><a href='#f1535' class='c013'><sup>[1535]</sup></a> In the last case burning in the foot, which
was the part bitten, then severe pain in the belly, inextinguishable
thirst, and vomiting, preceded a fit of laborious breathing, which
ushered in death. The most remarkable instance, however, of death
from the bite of the European viper is one lately described by Dr.
Braun, as having been occasioned in the Dutchy of Gotha by the
Coluber Chersea [Kreuzotter of the Germans]. A man, who represented
himself to be a snake-charmer, insisted on showing his skill
before Dr. Lenz, a naturalist of Schnepfenthal; and putting the head
of a viper belonging to this gentleman’s collection into his mouth,
he pretended to be about to devour it. Suddenly he threw the snake
from him, and it was found that he had been bitten near the root of
the tongue. In a few minutes he became so faint that he could not
stand, the tongue swelled a little, the eyes became dim, saliva issued
from the mouth, rattling respiration succeeded, and he died within
fifty minutes after being bitten.<a id='r1536' /><a href='#f1536' class='c013'><sup>[1536]</sup></a> A French writer observes that the
common viper of France is not very deadly; but that the bite of the
red viper may occasion death in a few hours.<a id='r1537' /><a href='#f1537' class='c013'><sup>[1537]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>The activity of the poison of the viper depends on a variety of circumstances.
When kept long confined, the animal loses its energy;
and after it has bitten repeatedly in rapid succession, its bite ceases
for some time to be poisonous, as the supply of poison is exhausted.
It appears also to be most active in hot and dry climates. Those
cases are always the most severe in which the symptoms begin soonest;
and the danger increases with the number of bites. An important
observation made by Dr. Wagner is that danger need not be dreaded
except when the bite is inflicted on small organs such as the fingers
or toes, because larger parts cannot be fully included between the
animal’s jaws, and fairly pierced by its fangs, but can only be scratched.
The properties of the fluid contained in the reservoir do not
cease with the animal’s life; nay they continue even when the fluid
is dried and preserved for a length of time. It may be swallowed in
considerable quantity without causing any injury whatever. In the
course of some experiments lately made in Italy, a pupil of Professor
Mangili swallowed at once the whole poison of four vipers without
suffering any inconvenience; and that of six vipers was given to a
blackbird, that of ten to a pigeon, and that of sixteen to a raven, with
no other effect beyond slight and transient stupor.<a id='r1538' /><a href='#f1538' class='c013'><sup>[1538]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>For the most recent account of the far more terrible effects of the
cobra di capello and rattlesnake, the reader may refer to the authorities
below.<a id='r1539' /><a href='#f1539' class='c013'><sup>[1539]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It was stated above that the poison of the viper retains its activity
when dried. I have had an opportunity of observing this in regard
to the poison of the cobra di capello, which is said to be preserved
in India by simply squeezing out the contents of the poison-bag, and
drying the liquid in a silver dish exposed to the sun. The specimen
in my possession, for which I am indebted to Mr. Wardrop of London,
has the appearance of small fragments of gum-arabic. It had
been kept for fifteen years when I tried its effects on a strong rabbit.
A grain and a half dissolved in ten drops of water, having been introduced
between the skin and muscles of the back, the animal in
eight minutes became very feeble and averse to stir, so that it remained
still even when placed in irksome postures; occasional slight
twitches of the limbs supervened; at length it became extremely
torpid, and breathed slowly by means of the abdominal muscles and
diaphragm alone; and in twenty-seven minutes it died exhausted,
without any precursory insensibility. The heart contracted readily,
when irritated nine minutes after death; so that the poison seemed
to operate by causing muscular paralysis, and consequently arresting
the respiration.</p>

<p class='c006'>There might also be arranged in an appendix to the present group
of poisons those <i>insects</i> whose sting is poisonous. The European
insects known to have a poisonous sting, are chiefly the scorpion,
tarantula, bee and wasp; of which the last two only are natives of
Britain.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>The poison of these insects occasions diffuse cellular inflammation,
which always ends in resolution. It is said, however,<a id='r1540' /><a href='#f1540' class='c013'><sup>[1540]</sup></a> and it may
be readily believed, that death has been sometimes caused in consequence
of a whole hive attacking an intruder and covering his body
with their stings. In an old French journal is shortly noticed the
case of a peasant who died soon after being stung over the eye by a
single bee.<a id='r1541' /><a href='#f1541' class='c013'><sup>[1541]</sup></a> A more probable story has been told in the Gazette de
Santé of a gardener who died of inflammation of the throat, in consequence
of being stung there by a wasp while he was eating an
apple, in which it had been concealed.<a id='r1542' /><a href='#f1542' class='c013'><sup>[1542]</sup></a> But the same accident has
often occurred without any material danger.</p>

<p class='c006'>The treatment of poisoning by venomous serpents need not be detailed
here. The subject is introduced merely to mention that the
treatment of poisoned wounds by the application of cupping-glasses
has been lately resorted to with success for curing the bite of the
viper. A patient of M. Piorry, two hours after being bitten, had all
the constitutional symptoms strongly developed, such as slow, very
feeble pulse, nausea, vomiting, and swelling of the face. When a
cupping-glass was applied for half an hour, the general symptoms
ceased and did not return. Next day diffuse inflammation began;
but it was checked by leeches.<a id='r1543' /><a href='#f1543' class='c013'><sup>[1543]</sup></a> An equally successful case is related
in the Calcutta Transactions by Mr. Clarke.<a id='r1544' /><a href='#f1544' class='c013'><sup>[1544]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING BY DISEASED AND DECAYED ANIMAL MATTER.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>Another and much more important group of poisons, that may
be arranged in the present order, comprehends animal matter usually
harmless or even wholesome, but rendered deleterious by disease or
decay. These poisons are formed in three ways, by morbid action
local or constitutional, by ordinary putrefaction, and by modified putrefaction.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Animal Matter rendered Poisonous by Diseased Action.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Under the first variety might be included the latent poisons by
means of which natural diseases are communicated by infection,
contact, and inoculation. Such poisons, however, being usually excluded
from a strict toxicological system, the only varieties requiring
notice are the animal poisons engendered by disease, and which do
not produce peculiar diseases, but merely inflammation. Several
species of this kind may be mentioned, comprehending the solids
and fluids in various unhealthy states of the body.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>One of these poisons, contained in the blood and perhaps in some
of the secretions of overdriven cattle, arises under circumstances in
which the body seems to deviate little from its natural condition. A
good account of the effects thus induced has been given in an essay
on the subject by Morand.<a id='r1545' /><a href='#f1545' class='c013'><sup>[1545]</sup></a> From the cases he describes it follows,
that the flesh of such animals is wholesome enough when cooked and
eaten; but that if the blood or raw flesh be applied to a wound or
scratch, nay even sometimes to the unbroken skin, a dangerous and
often fatal inflammation is excited, which at times differs little from
diffuse cellular inflammation, and at other times consists of a general
eruption of gangrenous boils, the <i>pustules malignes</i> of the French.
The deleterious effects occasionally observed to arise from offal are
probably analogous in their nature and their cause. On this subject
Sir B. Brodie has made some remarks which tend to show that the
application of various kinds of offal to wounds, and especially pricks
of the fingers with spiculæ of bone from the hare, may cause an obstinate
chronic erysipelas of the hand.<a id='r1546' /><a href='#f1546' class='c013'><sup>[1546]</sup></a> I have met with a case of
this nature, where the affection was erratic erythema of the hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another species of poison, allied to the preceding in its effects and
equally obscure in its nature, includes certain fluids of the human
body after natural death, which are probably modified, if not even
formed altogether, by morbid processes during life. Such poisons
are the most frequent source of the dreadful cellular inflammation,
often witnessed as the consequence of pricks received during dissection
by the anatomist. On this interesting but obscure subject,
much minute information will be found in the works quoted below.<a id='r1547' /><a href='#f1547' class='c013'><sup>[1547]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It is still a matter of question among pathologists what these poisons
are, and in what circumstances they spring up. By some
their baneful properties have been suspected to arise from the operation
of particular diseases on natural or morbid secretions;<a id='r1548' /><a href='#f1548' class='c013'><sup>[1548]</sup></a> and
although the precise diseases inducing these properties, and the
precise fluids which acquire them have by no means been satisfactorily
ascertained, it appears well established that no fluid possesses them
more frequently or in a higher degree than the serum effused into the
cavities of the chest and belly by recent inflammation of the serous
membranes of these cavities. By others the origin of the poison is
suspected to be wholly independent of diseased action in the living
body and to lie merely in certain changes effected in healthy secretions
by decay. And as the accidents produced by this poison
have occurred chiefly during the dissection of bodies recently dead,
it is supposed to exist only for a short time at the commencement of
decay, and to disappear in the farther progress of putrefaction.</p>

<p class='c006'>But whatever may be its nature and origin, we are well enough
acquainted with its effects; which are diffuse inflammation and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>violent constitutional excitement, quickly passing to a state resembling
typhoid fever. Sometimes the inflammation spreads steadily
towards the trunk from the part to which the poison was applied;
sometimes the inflammation around the injury is trifling and limited,
but a similar inflammation appears in or near the axilla, and subsequently
on other parts of the body; and the latter form of disease
is always attended with the highest constitutional derangement and
with the greatest danger.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another singular poison, unequivocally the product of disease, and
which acts as a local irritant, is the flesh or fluids of animals affected
at the time of their death with a carbuncular disorder, denominated
in Germany <i>Milzbrand</i>, and analogous to the <i>pustule maligne</i> of the
French. The disease, so far as I know, has not received a vulgar
name in the English language, being fortunately rare in Britain. It
is a constitutional and epidemic malady, which sometimes prevails
among cattle on the continent to an alarming extent, and is characterized
by the eruption of large gangrenous carbuncles on various
parts of the body. This distemper has the property of rendering the
solids and fluids poisonous to so great a degree, that not only persons
who handle the skin, entrails, blood, or other parts, but even
also those who eat the flesh, are apt to suffer severely. The affection
thus produced in man is sometimes ordinary inflammation of the
alimentary canal, or cholera;<a id='r1549' /><a href='#f1549' class='c013'><sup>[1549]</sup></a> more commonly a disorder precisely
the same as the pustule maligne;<a id='r1550' /><a href='#f1550' class='c013'><sup>[1550]</sup></a> but most frequently of all an eruption
of one or more large carbuncles resembling those of the original
disease of cattle.<a id='r1551' /><a href='#f1551' class='c013'><sup>[1551]</sup></a> It is often fatal. The carbuncular form has been
known to cause death in forty-eight hours.<a id='r1552' /><a href='#f1552' class='c013'><sup>[1552]</sup></a> It is an interesting
fact, for the knowledge of which we are indebted to M. Dupuy, that
the carbuncle of cattle may be caused by applying to a wound the
blood or spleen of an animal killed by gangrene of the lungs.<a id='r1553' /><a href='#f1553' class='c013'><sup>[1553]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>A poison analogous to the former in its nature, which has sometimes
occasioned severe and even fatal effects in man is the matter
of <i>glanders</i>, a contagious disease to which the horse is peculiarly
subject, and which is communicated probably by means of a morbid
secretion from the nostrils. This disease has been propagated to
man by infection; at least instances have been related where grooms
attending glandered horses, although they had no external injury
through which inoculation could take place, were attacked with
profuse fetid discharge from the nostrils, a pustular eruption on the
face, and colliquative diarrhœa, which has sometimes ended fatally in
a few days.<a id='r1554' /><a href='#f1554' class='c013'><sup>[1554]</sup></a> In other instances inoculation of the hand with the
blood of the glandered horse has produced alarming diffuse inflammation,
and a carbuncular eruption.<a id='r1555' /><a href='#f1555' class='c013'><sup>[1555]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It appears probable, that some peculiar circumstances with which
we are not yet acquainted must concur with the operation of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>poisons now under review, before they can take effect. At least
unequivocal facts have been published which show, that the fluids
and solids, as well as the emanations of animals infected and even
killed by glanders or the <i>pustule maligne</i>, may be often handled and
breathed with impunity. Such is the result of a careful inquiry
made under the direction of the Parisian Board of Health into the
nuisance occasioned by the great Nackery of Montfaucon.<a id='r1556' /><a href='#f1556' class='c013'><sup>[1556]</sup></a> Parent-Duchatelet,
the author of an elaborate report on the subject, considers
it clearly established that neither the workmen nor the horses connected
with the establishment, nor the tanners who are supplied with
hides from it, have ever presented a single instance of disease referrible
to the operation of diseased animal matter. Yet upwards of
twelve thousand horses are annually flayed there, and among these
it is calculated that at least three thousand six hundred are affected
with carbuncle, glanders, or farcy.<a id='r1557' /><a href='#f1557' class='c013'><sup>[1557]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Animal Matter rendered Poisonous by common Putrefaction.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The second mode in which animal matters, naturally wholesome
or harmless, may acquire the properties of irritant poisons, is by
their undergoing ordinary putrefaction.</p>

<p class='c006'>The tendency of putrefaction to impart deleterious qualities to
animal matters originally wholesome has been long known, and is
quite unequivocal. To those who are not accustomed to the use
of tainted meat, the mere commencement of decay is sufficient to
render meat insupportable and noxious. Game, only decayed enough
to please the palate of the epicure, has caused severe cholera in persons
not accustomed to eat it in that state. The power of habit,
however, in reconciling the stomach to the digestion of decayed meat
is inconceivable. Some epicures in civilized countries prefer a
slight taint even in their beef and mutton; and there are tribes of
savages still farther advanced in the cultivation of this department
of gastronomy, who eat with impunity rancid oil, putrid blubber, and
stinking offal. How far putrefaction may be allowed to advance
without overpowering the preservative tendency of habit, it is not
easy to tell. But with the present habits of this and other civilized
nations, the limit appears very confined.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>Putrid animal matter when injected into the veins of healthy animals
proves quickly fatal; and from the experiments of Gaspard and
Magendie,<a id='r1558' /><a href='#f1558' class='c013'><sup>[1558]</sup></a> together with the more recent researches of MM. Leuret
and Hamont,<a id='r1559' /><a href='#f1559' class='c013'><sup>[1559]</sup></a> the disease induced seems to resemble closely the typhoid
fever of man.</p>

<p class='c006'>Similar effects were observed by Magendie, when dogs were confined
over vessels in which animal matter was decaying, so that they
were obliged always to breathe the exhalations.<a id='r1560' /><a href='#f1560' class='c013'><sup>[1560]</sup></a> These discoveries
throw some light on the question regarding the tendency of putrid
effluvia to engender fever in man; and notwithstanding many well
ascertained facts of an opposite import, they show that, probably in
peculiar circumstances, decaying animal matter may excite epidemic
fevers. A detailed investigation of this important topic would be
misplaced here, as it belongs more to medical police than to medical
jurisprudence; but the two works quoted below are referred to for
examples, in my opinion, of the unequivocal origin of continued
fever in the cause now alluded to;<a id='r1561' /><a href='#f1561' class='c013'><sup>[1561]</sup></a> and other instances of the like
kind will be found in the Report of the Parliamentary Commission
on the Health of Towns.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another affection sometimes brought on by putrid exhalations is
violent diarrhœa or dysentery, of which a remarkable instance lately
occurred in the person of a well-known French physician, M. Ollivier.
While visiting a cellar where old bones were stored, he was
seized with giddiness, nausea, tendency to vomit and general uneasiness;
and subsequently he suffered from violent colic with profuse
diarrhœa, which put on the dysenteric character and lasted for
three days.<a id='r1562' /><a href='#f1562' class='c013'><sup>[1562]</sup></a> Chevallier, in noticing this accident, mentions his
having been affected somewhat in the same way when exposed to
the emanations of dead bodies; and it is a familiar fact that medical
men, who engage in anatomical researches after long disuse, are apt
to suffer at first from smart diarrhœa.</p>

<p class='c006'>The same remark must be applied here as at the close of the observations
in the last section. Without peculiar concurring circumstances
no bad effect results. This will follow from many facts illustrative
of the innocuous nature of various trades where the workmen
are perpetually exposed to the most noisome putrid effluvia. But no
facts of the kind are so remarkable as those collected in regard to the
establishment at Montfaucon by Parent-Duchatelet, who makes it
appear that this most abominable concentration of the worst of all
possible nuisances is not merely not injurious to the health of the
men and animals employed in and around it, but actually even preserves
them from epidemic or epizootic diseases.<a id='r1563' /><a href='#f1563' class='c013'><sup>[1563]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The effects of putrid animal matter when applied to wounds have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>been investigated experimentally by Professor Orfila; who found
that putrid blood, bile, or brain, caused death in this way within
twenty-four hours,—producing extensive local inflammation of the
diffuse kind, and great constitutional fever. In man also several
instances of diffuse cellular inflammation have been observed as the
consequence of pricks received during the dissection of putrid bodies.
The disease, as formerly observed, certainly arises in general from
pricks received in dissecting recent bodies. At the same time, a
few cases have been traced quite unequivocally to inoculation with
putrid matter;<a id='r1564' /><a href='#f1564' class='c013'><sup>[1564]</sup></a> and if any doubts existed on this point, the experiments
of Orfila would remove them.</p>

<p class='c006'>M. Lassaigne has examined chemically the putrid matter formed
by keeping flesh long in close vessels, and has found it to consist of
carbonate of ammonia, much caseate of ammonia, and a stinking volatile
oil,—the last of which is probably the poisonous ingredient.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Animal Matter rendered Poisonous by Modified Putrefaction.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The third way in which animal matters naturally wholesome may
become irritant poisons, is by their undergoing a modified putrefaction.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is probable that many common articles of food occasionally become
poisonous in this way; but none are so liable to acquire injurious
properties as certain articles much used in Germany, namely, a
particular kind of sausage, a particular kind of cheese, and bacon.
The last two species of poison have been occasionally observed in
France, and probably occur in Britain also. But the first has been
hitherto met with only in some districts of Germany.</p>

<p class='c006'>The best account yet given of the <i>sausage-poison</i> is contained in
two essays published by Dr. Kerner,<a id='r1565' /><a href='#f1565' class='c013'><sup>[1565]</sup></a> in a Thesis by Dr. Dann,<a id='r1566' /><a href='#f1566' class='c013'><sup>[1566]</sup></a>
and in a prize-essay by Dr. W. Horn.<a id='r1567' /><a href='#f1567' class='c013'><sup>[1567]</sup></a> It has at various times
committed great ravages in Germany, especially in the Würtemberg
territories, where 234 cases of poisoning with it occurred between
the years 1793 and 1827; and of that number no less than 110 proved
fatal.<a id='r1568' /><a href='#f1568' class='c013'><sup>[1568]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The symptoms of poisoning seldom begin till twenty-four, or even
forty-eight hours, after the noxious meal, and rather later than earlier.
The tardiness of their approach seems owing to the great indigestibility
of the fatty matter with which the active principle is mixed.
The first symptoms are pain in the stomach, vomiting, purging, and
dryness of the mouth and nose. The eyes, eyelids, and pupils then
become fixed and motionless; the voice is rendered hoarse, or is lost
altogether; the power of swallowing is much impaired; the pulse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>gradually fails, frequent swoonings ensue, and the skin becomes cold
and insensible. The secretions and excretions, with the exception
of the urine, are then commonly suspended; but sometimes profuse
diarrhœa continues throughout. The appetite is not impaired; fever
is rarely present; and the mind continues to the last unclouded.
Fatal cases end with convulsions and oppressed breathing between
the third and eighth day. In cases of recovery the period of convalescence
may be protracted to several years. The chief appearances
in the dead body are signs of inflammation in the mucous membrane
of the alimentary canal,—such as whiteness and dryness of the
throat, thickening of the gullet, redness of the stomach and intestines;
also croupy deposition in the windpipe; great flaccidity of the heart;
and a tendency in the whole body to resist putrefaction. In a set of
cases which occurred so lately as 1841, there was found after death
abscesses in the tonsils, dark bluish redness of the membrane of the
pharynx, windpipe and bronchial ramifications, gorging of the pulmonary
air-tubes and condensation of the pulmonary tissue itself,
dark redness of the fundus of the stomach, with circumscribed softening,
a dark gray, red, or black appearance of the mucous coat of
the intestines, accumulation of greenish-yellow fæces in the colon,
brittleness of the liver, and enlargement of the spleen.<a id='r1569' /><a href='#f1569' class='c013'><sup>[1569]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The article which is apt to occasion these baneful effects is of two
sorts, the white and the bloody sausage (<i>leberwürste</i>, <i>blut-würste</i>).
Both are of large size, the material being put into swine’s stomachs;
and they are cured by drying and smoking them in a chimney with
wood-smoke. Those which have been found to act as poisons possess
an acid reaction, are soft in consistence, have a nauseous, putrid
taste, and an unpleasant sweetish-sour smell, like that of purulent
matter. They are met with principally about the beginning of spring,
when they are liable to be often alternately frozen and thawed in the
curing. Those sausages only become poisonous which have been
boiled before being salted and hung up. They are poisonous only
at a particular stage of decay, and cease to be so when putrefaction
has advanced so far that sulphuretted-hydrogen is evolved. The
central part is often poisonous when the surface is wholesome.</p>

<p class='c006'>Various opinions have been entertained of the cause of the deleterious
qualities thus contracted. In recent times the principle has
been supposed to be pyroligneous acetic acid, hydrocyanic acid, or
cocculus indicus. Dr. Kerner, however, has shown that none of these
notions will account for the phenomena; and at first conceived he had
proved the poisonous principle to be a fatty acid analogous to the
sebacic acid of Thenard, and originating in a modified process of
putrefaction. From the poisonous sausage he procured by double
decomposition an acid similar in chemical properties to that obtained
from fat by destructive distillation; and by experiments on animals
he thought he observed, that the acid procured in either way produced
symptoms analogous to those of poisoning with the deleterious
sausage. Subsequently, however, he changed his views in some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>measure; and he now considers that the poison is a compound one,
consisting of a fatty acid analogous to the sebacic, and of a volatile
principle.<a id='r1570' /><a href='#f1570' class='c013'><sup>[1570]</sup></a> The results obtained by Dr. Dann coincide with the last
opinion. Dann infers from his researches that the poisonous principle
does not necessarily reside in an acid, but is an acrid empyreumatic
oil, which when pure is not active, but is rendered so by
uniting with various fatty acids.<a id='r1571' /><a href='#f1571' class='c013'><sup>[1571]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The results lately obtained by Buchner after an elaborate and
careful analysis are somewhat different and probably nearer the truth.
He first ascertained that the product of the distillation of fat has no
analogy with the sausage-poison. He found it to consist of animalized
acetic acid, and a fetid empyreumatic oil, the former of which
has no injurious effect on animals, while the latter, though an active
poison, is purely narcotic in its operation. On next examining a
sausage sent to him from Würtemberg, which had violently affected
four individuals and killed one of them in six days, he remarked that
the poisonous principle is not soluble in water, or capable of being
distilled over with it; and that cold alcohol removes a granular fatty
matter, which, when purified by distilled water, has a yellowish colour,
a peculiar nauseous smell, and a disagreeable oleaginous taste,
followed by extraordinary dryness of the throat for several hours.
Although it does not possess an acid reaction on litmus, it forms a
soap with alkalis, and is separated again by acids unchanged; and
consequently it may be considered a fatty acid, to which Buchner
proposes to give the name of Botulinic acid [Würst-fett-saüre]. It
concentrates in itself the poisonous properties of the crude sausage.
Thirty grains of it, which formed three-fourths of the whole product
of a single sausage, were given in two doses to a puppy with an interval
of a day between them. For some hours after the second dose
no apparent effect was produced. But gradually the animal became
dull, lay in the same spot, wasted rapidly away notwithstanding a
vigorous appetite, and died of exhaustion on the thirteenth day.
Half a grain causes insupportable dryness in the throat, which does
not go off for several hours.<a id='r1572' /><a href='#f1572' class='c013'><sup>[1572]</sup></a> With these results the contemporaneous
and unconnected researches of Dr. Schumann accord very remarkably.
Alcohol boiled on the poison-sausage deposited on cooling
a fatty matter, which, when washed with distilled water, possessed
all the properties specified by Buchner, as characterizing his
fatty acid, and acted on animals in the same way as the sausage-poison.<a id='r1573' /><a href='#f1573' class='c013'><sup>[1573]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>poison of cheese</i> has been for some time more generally known.
Dr. Henneman has published an interesting essay on several cases
which happened at Schwerin in 1823.<a id='r1574' /><a href='#f1574' class='c013'><sup>[1574]</sup></a> Another account of a similar
accident which happened at Minden in 1825 has been published
in Rust’s Magazin.<a id='r1575' /><a href='#f1575' class='c013'><sup>[1575]</sup></a> But by far the best information on the subject
<span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>is to be obtained from two papers in Horn’s Archiv,—the one by
Professor Hünefeld of Greifswald, describing the phenomena as he
witnessed them in that city in 1827, and containing an elaborate chemical
analysis and physiological experiments, by means of which he
conceives he has discovered the deleterious principles contained in
the cheese,<a id='r1576' /><a href='#f1576' class='c013'><sup>[1576]</sup></a>—the other by Dr. Westrumb of Hameln, who investigated
the particulars of seven cases which came under his notice in
1826, and with the aid of Sertürner, the chemist, traced the properties
of the poison to almost the same principles with those indicated
by the researches of Hünefeld.<a id='r1577' /><a href='#f1577' class='c013'><sup>[1577]</sup></a> Besides the cases which have given
origin to these papers, others have occurred throughout Germany in
the same period; and during the third quarter of last century this
kind of poisoning was so common, that several of the German states
investigated the subject, and legislative enactments were passed in
consequence.</p>

<p class='c006'>For a long time the prevalent belief was that the cheese acquired an
impregnation from copper vessels used in the dairies; and accordingly
the Austrian, Wirtemberg and Ratesberg States prohibited the use of
copper for such purposes. This opinion, however, was proved by
chemical analysis to be untenable; and the inquiries of Hünefeld and
Sertürner, have now rendered it probable that the poisonous property
of the cheese resides in two animal acids, analogous, if not identical,
with the caseïc and sebacic acids.</p>

<p class='c006'>The mode in which the formation of these acids is accounted for is
as follows. According to the researches of Proust the sharp peculiar
taste of old cheese is owing to the gradual conversion of the curd or
casein into the caseate of ammonia, which in sound cheeses is always
united with the excess of alkali. In the cheese in question (<i>barscher-käse</i>,
<i>quark-käse</i>, <i>hand-käse</i>) the curd, before being salted, is left for
some time in a heap to ferment, in consequence of which it becomes
sour and afterwards ripens faster. But if the milk has been curdled
with vinegar,—if the acid liquor formed while it ferments is not
carefully drained off,—if the fermentation is allowed to go too far,—if
too little salt is used in preserving the curd,—or if flour has
been mixed with the curd, the subsequent ripening or decaying of
the cheese follows a peculiar course, and a considerable excess of
caseïc acid is formed, as well as some sebacic acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>The poisonous cheeses, according to Westrumb, present no peculiarity
in their appearance, taste or smell. But Hünefeld says that
they are yellowish-red, soft, and tough, with harder and darker
lumps interspersed, that they have a disagreeable taste, redden litmus,
and becomes flesh-red instead of yellow, under the action of nitric
acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>The symptoms they cause in man appear to be nearly the same
with those produced by the poisonous sausage, and usually commence,
according to Hünefeld, in five or six hours, according to Westrumb
in half an hour. They constitute various degrees and combinations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>of gastro-enteric inflammation. In the most severe of Hünefeld’s
cases the quantity taken did not exceed four ounces, and was sometimes
only an ounce.</p>

<p class='c006'>The same author found that a drachm and a half of the caseïc acid,
which he procured from the cheese, killed a cat in eight minutes,
and the same quantity of the sebacic acid another in three hours.
His experiments, however, are not quite conclusive of the fact that
these acids are really the poisonous principles, as he has not extended
his experimental researches to the caseïc and sebacic acids prepared
in the ordinary way. His views will probably be altered and simplified,
if future experiments should confirm the late inquiries of Braconnot,
who has stated that Proust’s caseïc acid is a modification of
the acetic, combined with an acrid oil.<a id='r1578' /><a href='#f1578' class='c013'><sup>[1578]</sup></a> Westrumb procured analogous
results with those of Hünefeld when he gave to animals the
acid fat which he separated in the course of his analysis.</p>

<p class='c006'>The poisonous cheese has been hitherto met with chiefly in some
parts of Germany. From information communicated to me by Dr.
Swanwick of Macclesfield, there is some reason to think that a parallel
poison is occasionally met with in Cheshire, among the small hill-farms,
where the limited extent of the dairies obliges the farmer to
keep the curd for several days before a sufficient quantity is accumulated
for the larger cheeses.—I am indebted to Mr. Wilson of Lockerby
for the particulars of a set of cases, which seem to have been
owing to some obscure poison in cheese. A gentleman, an hour after
eating the suspected cheese, was seized with extreme weakness and
severe vomiting for four hours, then with general soreness and a
mercurial taste in the mouth, and afterwards with tenesmus, bloody
stools, soreness of the gums, and cramps in the limbs; from which
symptoms he did not recover for four weeks. Five other members
of his household suffered similarly, but less severely, and also the
shop-boy who ate a little while selling it. None of the ordinary
mineral poisons could be detected in it.—It is hardly necessary to
add, that analogous properties may be imparted to cheese by the intentional
or accidental addition of other poisons of a mineral nature.
This subject has been already alluded to in the section upon lead.</p>

<p class='c006'>As connected, though indeed but remotely, with the cheese-poison,
some notice may be here taken of a peculiar mode in which it has
been supposed that <i>milk</i> may acquire the properties of an acrid
poison. It has been several times remarked on the continent, that
the milk even of the cow, but more particularly that of the ewe and
goat, may act like a violent poison, although no mineral or other
deleterious impregnation could be detected in it; and these effects
have been variously and vaguely ascribed to the animal having been
diseased, or to its having fed on acrid vegetables, which pass into
the milk without injury to its health, because though poisonous to
most animals, they are not so to the Ruminantia. This singular topic
cannot be thoroughly investigated, as precise facts are still wanting.
But the two following examples of the accident alluded to may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>mentioned. One occurred at Aurillac, a village in France. Fifteen
or sixteen customers of a particular dealer in goats’ milk were at
one and the same time attacked with all the symptoms of violent
cholera; and about twenty-four hours afterwards the goat too was
taken ill with the same affection, and died in three days.<a id='r1579' /><a href='#f1579' class='c013'><sup>[1579]</sup></a> The
other instance occurred at Hereford in Westphalia. Six people of
a family, after partaking of goat’s butter-milk, were simultaneously
attacked with violent vomiting, tension of the epigastrium, and retraction
of the lower belly; and several of them suffered so severely
as even to have been thought by their physician, Dr. Bonorden, to
be in danger.<a id='r1580' /><a href='#f1580' class='c013'><sup>[1580]</sup></a> Dr. Westrumb has alluded to similar cases in his
memoir on the poison of cheese, and has proved that the ordinary
explanations of them are far from satisfactory. Among other judicious
observations he remarks, that the poison has been generally
believed to arise sometimes from the cattle having fed on the <i>Euphorbia
esula</i>, a species of spurge; that, according to Viridet in his
<i>Tractatus de Prima Coctione</i>, l. i. c. 15, certain fields in the neighbourhood
of Embrim were of necessity abandoned by the shepherds,
because the milk of their cows was rendered useless by the abundance
of that plant among the herbage; but that he himself has found
cattle will not touch it so long as grass and other wholesome vegetables
are to be found in the pasturage.<a id='r1581' /><a href='#f1581' class='c013'><sup>[1581]</sup></a> Professors Orfila and Marc,
who were appointed by the Society of Medicine of Paris to report
upon the accident at Aurillac, state, that in parallel cases which had
been referred to them by the police at Paris they had been unable to
detect any mineral poison; that none of the received explanations
are in their opinion satisfactory; and that they are disposed to ascribe
the poisonous alteration of the milk to new principles formed by a
vital process.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another common article of food, which has occasionally produced
similar effects with the poisonous sausages and cheese, is bacon.
Dr. Geiseler has related an accident which occurred in a family of
eight persons, and which he traced to this cause. The symptoms
were almost exactly the same with those described by Kerner, with
the addition, however, of delirium and loss of recollection; and in
two they were so violent as seriously to endanger life. The father
of the family alone escaped, having stewed his bacon, while the rest
ate it raw.<a id='r1582' /><a href='#f1582' class='c013'><sup>[1582]</sup></a> His escape might have arisen from the fatty acid having
been decomposed, or the acrid oil expelled, by the heat. It is not
improbable that other varieties of cured meat may also become
poisonous. Cadet de Gassicourt mentions, that he had been frequently
desired by the police to examine cured meat which had
produced symptoms of poisoning at Paris,<a id='r1583' /><a href='#f1583' class='c013'><sup>[1583]</sup></a> and Orfila makes the
same remark in his Lectures on Medical Jurisprudence.<a id='r1584' /><a href='#f1584' class='c013'><sup>[1584]</sup></a> As the
meat always came from the shops of meat-curers, and did not contain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>any mineral poison, it probably owed its qualities to the same ingredient
as the bacon in Geiseler’s cases. A full and interesting account
of an accident of the kind has also been given by M. Ollivier, of
which the following is an analysis. Three members of a family at
Paris, on the day after eating a ham-pie, were seized with shivering,
cold sweats, violent pain in the stomach, frequent vomiting, burning
thirst, excessive tenderness of the belly, profuse purging, and colic;
but they all recovered under antiphlogistic treatment. On subsequent
inquiry it appeared that about the same period other customers of
the pastry-cook who supplied the pie had been similarly affected;
and consequently an investigation was made into the cause under
the authority of the police. After a very careful analysis, however,
by MM. Barruel and Ollivier, it was clearly made out, that the pie
did not contain a trace of any of the common mineral poisons; and
therefore the only conclusion Ollivier conceived it possible to draw
was, that the ham had acquired the properties of the poisonous sausage
or cheese of Germany.<a id='r1585' /><a href='#f1585' class='c013'><sup>[1585]</sup></a> Two similar reports have been since
published, one by MM. Lecanu, Labarraque, and Delamorlière,
another by Chevallier; and both agree in ascribing the poisonous
effects to the decay of the meat, the ordinary poisons having been
sought for in vain. In the cases examined by Chevallier, the article
was a sort of sausage, called in Paris “Italian Cheese,” and made
of scraps of various kinds of meat, especially pork.<a id='r1586' /><a href='#f1586' class='c013'><sup>[1586]</sup></a> M. Boutigny
has published an account of a similar accident which befel a great
number of people at a festival in France. He could not find any of
the ordinary poisons in the meat, which had been taken chiefly in
the form of sausages; and being consequently persuaded that the
suspected articles were wholesome, he dined on stuffed turkey, sold
by the dealer who had supplied them. But he was seized with
chilliness, contracted pulse, cold sweating, lividity of the countenance,
great anxiety, and then with vomiting and purging; after
which he slowly recovered.<a id='r1587' /><a href='#f1587' class='c013'><sup>[1587]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Other articles of food have been occasionally observed to act injuriously
on the health. Thus M. Ollivier has given an account of
a whole family having been apparently poisoned with mutton under
the influence of modified decay. Six individuals were attacked
soon after dinner with vomiting, purging, colic, tenderness of the
belly, extreme prostration, and a small hurried pulse. Four of them
died within eight days. General inflammatory redness, with some
extravasation under the mucous coat, was found throughout the
whole course of the small intestines. No trace could be detected of
any of the ordinary poisons; and Ollivier was therefore led to ascribe
the accident to some peculiar change produced in stewed mutton,
which all the individuals had partaken of at dinner.<a id='r1588' /><a href='#f1588' class='c013'><sup>[1588]</sup></a> In 1839 a
singular accident happened at Zurich, which was ascribed to decayed
<i>veal</i> and <i>ham</i>. On a fete-day 600 people, who had dined upon cold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>roast-veal and ham in a wooden erection, were all taken ill with
shivering, giddiness, headache, burning fever, diarrhœa and vomiting;
some had delirium, others a fœtid salivation and even ill-conditioned
ulcers of the mouth; and in the worst cases collapse of the
countenance, involuntary stools, and extreme prostration preceded
death. On dissection the alimentary mucous membrane was found
softened and the intestinal follicles ulcerated. The cause was supposed
to have been satisfactorily traced to incipient putrefaction of
the veal and ham, which constituted the fundamental part of the
repast.<a id='r1589' /><a href='#f1589' class='c013'><sup>[1589]</sup></a> Effects somewhat similar have been observed from spoiled
<i>goose-grease</i>, used in dressing food. Dr. Siedler has related four
cases where violent symptoms were thus induced. Two adults and
two children, after eating a dish seasoned with goose-grease, were
seized with giddiness, prostration of strength, anxiety, sweating,—burning
pain in the lower belly, aggravated by pressure,—violent
vomiting, in one case sanguinolent,—involuntary stools, and urine,
and dilatation of the pupil. In one of the adults there was also
complete insensibility, with imperceptible pulse for six minutes. No
metallic poison could be found. The grease was acid, and of a repulsive
odour; and three ounces given to a dog acted violently and
in the same manner.<a id='r1590' /><a href='#f1590' class='c013'><sup>[1590]</sup></a> Another article of food which has appeared
occasionally to produce parallel effects is <i>smoked sprats</i>. An instance
of their injurious operation is briefly described in the work
quoted below;<a id='r1591' /><a href='#f1591' class='c013'><sup>[1591]</sup></a> and Dr. O’Shaughnessey informed me some years
ago, that, while in London, he met with the case of a female, advanced
in pregnancy, who after eating smoked sprats, in which she
remarked a disagreeable sharp taste, was attacked with severe colic,
sickness, vomiting of food mixed with streaks and clots of blood,
and some diarrhœa. Putrid <i>pickled salmon</i> has occasioned death
in this country;<a id='r1592' /><a href='#f1592' class='c013'><sup>[1592]</sup></a> and I may mention that I have known most violent
diarrhœa occasioned in two instances by a very small portion of
the oily matter about the fins of <i>kipper</i> or smoked salmon, so that I
have no doubt a moderate quantity would produce serious effects.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although these illustrations of the effects of modified putrefaction
in rendering wholesome meat noxious have been taken in a great
measure from continental experience, this has been done rather because
the subject has been more fully and accurately investigated
there, than because similar poisons are unknown in Britain. The
defective system of medical police in this country would allow
such accidents as those mentioned above to pass sometimes without
notice, and almost always without scientific examination; but
it must not therefore be supposed that they are wholly unknown.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following incident, which happened a few years ago on the
Galloway coast, is an instance of poisoning not less alarming than
any of those which have occurred in Germany. In the autumn of
1826 four adults and ten children ate at dinner a stew made with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>meat taken from a dead calf, which was found by one of them on
the sea shore, and of which no history could be procured. For three
hours no ill effect followed. But they were then all seized with pain in
the stomach, efforts to vomit, purging, and lividity of the face, succeeded
by a soporose state like the stupor caused by opium, except
that when roused the patient had a peculiar wild expression. One
person died comatose in the course of six hours. The rest, being
freely purged and made to vomit, eventually got well; but for some
days they required the most powerful stimulants to counteract the
exhaustion and collapse which followed the sopor. The meat, they
said, looked well enough at the time it was used. Yet the remains of the
fish which formed the noxious meal had a black colour and nauseous
smell; and the uncooked flesh had a white, glistening appearance,
and was so far decayed that its odour excited vomiting and fainting.<a id='r1593' /><a href='#f1593' class='c013'><sup>[1593]</sup></a>
It is much to be regretted that this accident was not properly inquired
into. The only conjecture which the facts will warrant as to
the cause of the poisonous quality of the meat is, that in consequence
of having lain long in the water, the flesh had begun to undergo the
adipocirous putrefaction; and that in the course of the changes thus
induced the meat became impregnated with some poisonous principle,
like that of the German sausages, or cheese.</p>

<p class='c006'>An accident of a similar nature, for the particulars of which I am
indebted to Dr. Swanwick of Macclesfield, occurred at Stockport in
the summer of 1830. A family of five persons took for dinner broth
made of beef, which, owing to its black colour, the master of the
family had previously said to his wife he thought bad and unfit for
use. In the course of some hours two boys were attacked with sickness
and vomiting, but appear to have got soon well, probably owing
to the early discharge of the poison. Next morning a washerwoman
who had dined with the family was seized with violent pain in the
bowels, diarrhœa, racking pains and weakness in the limbs; and she
did not recover for ten days. On the evening of the second day the
master of the house was similarly affected, and was ill for a fortnight.
And a day later his wife was also seized with a similar disorder, preceded
by soreness of the throat and tongue and difficulty of swallowing,
and ending fatally in fourteen days. The last person was previously
in delicate health, and subject to disorder in the stomach
and bowels. The investigation made by the police authorities into
the circumstances of this accident was extremely imperfect: but there
seems little reason to doubt that unsound meat was the cause.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am not sure under what head to arrange the following observations,
communicated to me by Dr. M’Divitt of Canterbury, and of
which he has since published a detailed account.<a id='r1594' /><a href='#f1594' class='c013'><sup>[1594]</sup></a> But they may be
mentioned, perhaps not inappropriately, in the present place; and
at all events they deserve careful attention, as referring to a description
of cases which may be mistaken for other kinds of poisoning.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is well known that pork in all forms, but especially when fresh,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>is apt to cause indigestion in many persons who are not accustomed
to it. But Dr. M’Divitt has shown by a number of interesting cases,
that even in those habituated to its use, it may, from unascertained
causes, excite symptoms closely allied to those of irritant poisoning.
The effects sometimes begin within three hours, the symptoms being
those of an affection of the stomach, such as sudden violent pain in
the epigastrium, difficult breathing, irregularity of the pulse, great
prostration and alarm, coldness of the extremities and vomiting. If
a longer period elapses,—and sometimes no injury accrues for many
hours, or even a whole day,—the symptoms indicate an affection of
the abdomen, namely, pain in the region of the duodenum, or of the
sigmoid flexure of the colon, with the other symptoms just enumerated,
but which ere long become attended with more pungent pain,
tension and tenderness of the belly, frequency of the pulse, and ineffectual
straining to evacuate the bowels. In the less urgent and
slower cases of this nature there is little or no vomiting. Sometimes
nettle-rash appears. Stimulants, opiates, and blood-letting are of no
avail; and the only useful remedies are emetics and cathartics, which
speedily put an end to the symptoms by removing their cause. In all
the cases related by the author the pork was either fresh or recently
salted, fatter than usual, but not ill preserved or otherwise faulty in
any appreciable respect. In every instance the individuals had
eaten pork often before without injury; and on several occasions
others ate without harm the same pork which seemed deleterious.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXV.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING BY MECHANICAL IRRITANTS.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>The <i>fifth</i> order of the irritant class of poisons includes mechanical
irritants.</p>

<p class='c006'>These substances have not properly speaking any poisonous quality;
but occasion symptoms like those of poisoning, and even sometimes
death itself, in consequence of their mechanical qualities only. They
have therefore been excluded from every toxicological system proposed
in recent times; but in a medico-legal work on poisoning it would
be wrong to pass them without notice.</p>

<p class='c006'>The most important of the mechanical irritants are those which
cause injury by reason of their roughness, sharpness, or size.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many instances have occurred of persons having swallowed fragments
of steel, copper, iron, broken glass, or entire prune-stones,
cherry-stones, and the like,—who not long afterwards were attacked
with signs of inflammation, or some other abdominal disease, and were
carried off by it as by the administration of poison. The disorders
thus induced are almost always of a chronic or lingering kind, and
commonly depend on gradual perforation of the intestines by the
foreign body pressing on the coats. In general the illness ends in inflammation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>of the peritonæum. Sometimes the irritating substance
perforates the skin and muscles as well as the intestines, and escapes
outwardly; and a few individuals have even recovered under these
circumstances. An excellent account of the ordinary course of such
accidents is given in the London Medical and Physical Journal. The
person swallowed a chocolate bean, and after experiencing many uneasy
sensations throughout the belly for several days, was attacked
with peritonitis and died.<a id='r1595' /><a href='#f1595' class='c013'><sup>[1595]</sup></a> Mr. Howship has related the particulars
of the case of a woman, died after two years of constant suffering, in
consequence of having swallowed a large quantity of cherry-stones.<a id='r1596' /><a href='#f1596' class='c013'><sup>[1596]</sup></a>
Dr. Marcet has also described the case of a sailor who died in a similar
way after swallowing several large clasp-knives.<a id='r1597' /><a href='#f1597' class='c013'><sup>[1597]</sup></a> Thus too, although
it is a familiar fact, that needles and pins are in general swallowed
with impunity, death nevertheless sometimes arises from this cause.
Guersent mentions the case of a child who died in the course of two
months of frequent vomiting caused by swallowing a pin, which was
found after death pinning the stomach, as it were, to the liver.<a id='r1598' /><a href='#f1598' class='c013'><sup>[1598]</sup></a> Dupuytren
relates the case of a woman, who, after swallowing an incredible
number of needles and pins, became very lean and was confined
to bed by the excruciating pain excited on motion by the needles and
pins escaping through the skin. There were seldom less than fifty
tumours or abscesses on various parts of the body; and Dupuytren,
on opening about a hundred of these, invariably found one or more
needles or pins in each. She laboured under general debility, irritative
fever, and marasmus, and at length died hectic. After death
many hundred pins and needles were found among the muscles and
viscera.<a id='r1599' /><a href='#f1599' class='c013'><sup>[1599]</sup></a> Many other examples might be referred to, but these will
suffice for information on the ordinary effects of mechanical irritants of
the kind under consideration.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the case of Dr. Marcet and other similar facts, it appears that
large and even angular bodies do not always cause serious mischief,
nay, that they have been frequently swallowed without any material
injury. Dr. Marcet’s sailor in the course of his life had repeatedly
swallowed several clasp-knives in quick succession: and nevertheless
recovered perfectly after some days of slight illness. As to prune and
cherry-stones, buttons, coins, needles, pins, and the like, they have
been very often taken, and even sometimes in large quantities, without
any harm. It is indeed extraordinary, and almost incredible, if
the facts were not authenticated beyond the possibility of a doubt,
how much mechanical irritation the alimentary canal has been subjected
to, without sustaining any injury. Mr. Wakefield mentions that
a man, who was committed to the House of Correction, swallowed
seven half-crowns, to prevent the prison authorities from depriving
him of them. He suffered no inconvenience for twenty months;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>when, after an attack of sickness, slight bowel-complaint, and general
tenderness of the belly, he discharged them all at one evacuation.<a id='r1600' /><a href='#f1600' class='c013'><sup>[1600]</sup></a>
Many singular instances to the same effect have been related in the
various medical journals of Europe. At the head of the list, however,
may be placed the following, which is related by the late Professor
Osiander of Göttingen, in his work on Suicide.</p>

<p class='c006'>A young German nobleman tried to kill himself in a fit of insanity
by swallowing different indigestible substances, but without success.
He never suffered any particular inconvenience except a single attack
of vomiting daily, though in the course of seven months after being
detected he passed the following articles by stool—150 pieces of
sharp, angular glass, some of them two inches long—102 brass pins—150
iron nails—three large hair pins, and seven large chair-nails—a
pair of shirt-sleeve buttons—a collar-buckle, half of a shoe-buckle,
and three bridle-buckles—half a dozen sixpenny pieces—three
hooks, and a lump of lead—three large fragments of a currycomb,
and fifteen bits of nameless iron articles, many of them two
inches in length.<a id='r1601' /><a href='#f1601' class='c013'><sup>[1601]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Before such articles occasion serious harm, it is necessary that some
cause coincide, by means of which the foreign bodies are detained
long in the same part of the intestines; otherwise the irritation they
produce is too trivial to excite disease.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only substance of this kind which it is necessary to particularize
is <i>pounded glass</i>. A common notion prevails that pounded glass is an
active poison. There is no doubt, indeed, that it does possess some
irritant properties even when finely pulverized; for it titillates and
smarts the nostrils, and inflames the eyes. There is also little doubt
that when swallowed in fragments of moderate size, especially if the
stomach is empty, it may wound the viscera. But it is in this way
only that it has any action when swallowed, and even then its effects
are by no means uniformly serious. It can have no chemical action
on the stomach; it cannot act through absorption, as it is quite insoluble:
and when finely pulverized, it cannot easily wound the villous
coat of the alimentary canal, on account of the abundance and viscidity
of the lubricating mucus.</p>

<p class='c006'>Accordingly, M. Lesauvage ascertained that 2½ drachms of the
powder may be given to a cat at once without hurting the animal,—that
in the course of eight days seven ounces might be given to a dog
without any bad consequence, although the period chosen for administering
it was always some time before meals,—and that even when the
glass was in fragments a line in length, no symptoms of irritation
were induced. Relying indeed on these results he himself swallowed
a considerable number of similar fragments; and did not sustain
any injury.<a id='r1602' /><a href='#f1602' class='c013'><sup>[1602]</sup></a> Caldani likewise, an Italian physician, after some
experiments on animals, gave a boy fifteen years old several drachms of
pounded glass, without observing any bad effects; and at his request
<span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>Mandruzzato repeated his experiments on animals, and himself swallowed
on two successive days two drachms and a half each day
without sustaining any injury.<a id='r1603' /><a href='#f1603' class='c013'><sup>[1603]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Similar observations have been made by others also. Dr. Turner
of Spanish Town, Jamaica, has informed me, that an attempt was
made there by a negro to poison a whole family by administering
pounded glass; but, although a large quantity was taken by seven
persons, none of them suffered any inconvenience. Not long ago the
occurrence of a similar case at Paris gave rise to a careful investigation
of the whole subject by Baudelocque and Chaussier. A young
man, Lavalley, married a girl who was pregnant by him; but it was
agreed that she should live with her father till her delivery was over.
A month after the marriage Lavalley invited his wife and father-in-law
to dinner; and his wife ate heartily boiled pork, bloody-sausages,
and roast-veal, and subsequently drank coffee with brandy in
it. On returning home in the evening she became unwell, continued
so all night, next morning was seized with violent pain in the stomach
and vomiting, and died in convulsions. The period of her
death is not mentioned in the report I have seen. A suspicion of
poisoning having arisen after burial, the body was disinterred in
forty-two days; and, although it was much decayed, black points
and patches could be distinguished in many parts of the bowels, together
with a quantity of broken down glass. The medical inspectors
accordingly declared that she had died of poisoning with
pounded glass; and the husband was imprisoned. Baudelocque and
Chaussier, who were consulted, ascribed the black patches to putrefaction
or venous congestion, and declared that in whatever way the
glass had got into the bowels, she had not died of poisoning with
the substance, as pounded glass is not deleterious.<a id='r1604' /><a href='#f1604' class='c013'><sup>[1604]</sup></a> A similar opinion
as to the properties of pounded glass was more lately given by Professor
Marc, when consulted on a case of attempted poisoning, in
which the person against whom the attempt was made felt the rough
particles in his mouth while taking the second spoonful of soup in
which the glass was contained.<a id='r1605' /><a href='#f1605' class='c013'><sup>[1605]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>This opinion certainly appears to be in general true. At the same
time instances are not wanting to render it probable, that pounded or
broken glass is occasionally hurtful. Thus, passing over the more
doubtful examples recorded by the older authors, we have the two
following cases related by good authorities in the most modern times.
One has been published by Mr. Hebb of Worcester. A child, eleven
months old, died of a few days’ illness in very suspicious circumstances.
On Mr. Hebb being requested by the coroner to examine
the body, he found the inside of the stomach lined with a tough layer
of mucus streaked with blood; the villous coat was highly vascular,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>and covered with numberless particles of glass of various sizes, some
of which simply touched, while others lacerated it; and no other
morbid appearance could be detected in the body.<a id='r1606' /><a href='#f1606' class='c013'><sup>[1606]</sup></a> The other case
is described by Portal. A man undertook for a wager to eat his
wine-glass, and actually swallowed a part of it. But he was attacked
with acute pain in the stomach, and subsequently with convulsions.
Portal made him eat a surfeit of cabbage; and having thus enveloped
the fragments, administered an emetic, which brought away
the glass and vegetables together.<a id='r1607' /><a href='#f1607' class='c013'><sup>[1607]</sup></a> The same feat has undoubtedly
been sometimes accomplished with impunity. For example, in the
Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, an instance is related of a
man who champed and swallowed three-fourths of a drinking-glass
without suffering any harm; and the person mentioned by Osiander
swallowed many pieces of glass, and sustained no inconvenience (p.
<a href='#Page_503'>503</a>). But these facts will not altogether outweigh the equally pointed
narratives of Portal and Mr. Hebb. And, on the whole, the medical
jurist must come to the conclusion, that broken and pounded glass,
though generally harmless, may sometimes prove injurious or even
fatal.<a id='r1608' /><a href='#f1608' class='c013'><sup>[1608]</sup></a> Powdered glass, however, is probably inert.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another variety of injury from the mechanical irritants is inflammation
from hot liquids, such as <i>melted lead or boiling water</i>. These,
when swallowed, may unquestionably cause serious mischief, and
even death; and the symptoms they induce are exactly those of the
irritant poisons properly so called.</p>

<p class='c006'>The effects of boiling water have been investigated experimentally
by Dr. Bretonneau of Tours; and the results illustrate forcibly the
observations which have been repeatedly made in the course of this
work, respecting the slight constitutional derangement caused by
such poisons as have merely a local irritating power. He found that
when boiling water was injected in the quantity of eight ounces
into the stomach of dogs, it excited inflammation, passing on to
gangrene, both in the villous and muscular coats. The symptoms,
however, were trifling. For a day or two the animals appeared
languid; but in three days they generally became lively and playful,
one of them actually lined a bitch, and it was only on strangling
them and examining the bodies, that the extent of the mischief was
discovered.<a id='r1609' /><a href='#f1609' class='c013'><sup>[1609]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>I am not aware that any such case have hitherto occurred in man.
Death from drinking boiling water, indeed, is not an uncommon accident,
particularly in Ireland and some parts of England, where
children, who are in the habit of drinking cold water from the tea-kettle,
have swallowed boiling water by mistake. It appears, however,
that in these instances death is not owing to inflammation of
the gullet and stomach, but to inflammation of the upper part of the
windpipe,—the water never passing lower than the pharynx. The
best information on this subject is contained in an interesting paper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>by Dr. Hall.<a id='r1610' /><a href='#f1610' class='c013'><sup>[1610]</sup></a> He has there given the particulars of four cases which
came under his notice; from which it follows that the disease induced
is always <i>cynanche laryngea</i>, proving fatal by suffocation. Two of
his patients died suffocated; another, while in imminent danger, was
relieved by tracheotomy, but died afterwards of exhaustion; the
fourth recovered suddenly during a fit of screaming, when apparently
about to be choked; and it was supposed that the vesicles around
the glottis had been burst by the cries.</p>

<p class='c006'>Pouring melted lead down the throat was a frequent mode of despatching
criminals and prisoners in former ages. Only one authentic
case is to be found on record of death from this cause in modern
times. It occurred at the burning of the Eddistone light-house. A
man, while gazing up at the fire with his mouth open, received a
shower of melted lead from the building, and expired after twelve
days of suffering. Seven ounces and a half of lead had reached the
stomach; and the stomach was severely burnt, and ulcerated.<a id='r1611' /><a href='#f1611' class='c013'><sup>[1611]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>In concluding the Irritant Poisons, and before proceeding to the
next class, the Narcotics, it is necessary to observe, that besides the
substances which have been treated of, there are others not usually
considered poisons, and some that are even used daily for seasoning
food, which, nevertheless, when taken in large quantities, will prove
injurious and even occasion all the chief symptoms of the active
irritants. These substances connect the true poisons with substances
which are inert in regard to the animal economy.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is impossible to particularize all the articles of the kind now
alluded to. But in illustration, I may refer in a few words to six
common substances, pepper, Epsom salt, alum, cream of tartar, sulphate
of potash, and common salt.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Pepper</i>, which is daily used by all ranks with impunity, will nevertheless
cause even dangerous symptoms when taken in large quantity.
In Rust’s Journal is noticed the case of a man affected with a
tertian ague, who after taking between an ounce and a half and two
ounces of pepper in brandy, was attacked with convulsions, burning
in the throat and stomach, great thirst, and vomiting of every thing
he swallowed. His case was treated as one of simple gastritis, and
he recovered.<a id='r1612' /><a href='#f1612' class='c013'><sup>[1612]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>A very striking instance, which may be arranged under the present
head, has also been related to me, of apparent poisoning with Epsom
salt. A boy ten years old took two ounces of this laxative partly
dissolved, partly mixed in a tea-cupful of water; and had hardly
swallowed it before he was observed to stagger and become unwell.
When the surgeon saw him half an hour after, the pulse was imperceptible,
the breathing slow and difficult, the whole frame in a state
of extreme debility, and in ten minutes more the child died without
any other symptom of note, and in particular without any vomiting.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>The circumstances having been investigated judicially, it appeared
that the substance taken was pure Epsom salt; that the father, who was
doatingly fond of the child, gave the laxative on account of a trifling
illness which he supposed might arise from worms; and that on the
most careful inspection of the body, no morbid appearance whatever
could be found in any part of it. For the particulars of this singular
case, I am indebted to Dr. Dewar of Dunfermline, the medical inspector
under the sheriff’s warrant. It shows that in certain circumstances
even the laxative neutral salts may be irritating enough
to cause speedy death.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of the same nature probably are the cases which have lately led
some to ascribe poisonous properties to <i>sulphate of potash</i>, a purgative
salt at one time in common use. About three years ago several
instances of apparent poisoning with this substance occurred in
Paris; and one of them proved fatal. This was the case of a woman,
recently delivered, who got 100 grains every fifteen minutes till she
had taken six doses. Immediately after the first dose she was seized
with severe pain in the stomach, nausea, vomiting, numbness, and
cramps in the arms and legs, then with dyspnœa and severe purging,
and in two hours she expired. The stomach and intestines were
emphysematous, but otherwise healthy; and the stomach contained
sulphate of potash, but not a trace of any of the common poisons.
The stock of this salt in the shop where it had been purchased was
found to be perfectly pure.<a id='r1613' /><a href='#f1613' class='c013'><sup>[1613]</sup></a>—A remarkable case of the same kind
lately led to a criminal trial in London. A man Haynes was charged
with attempting to procure abortion by giving his wife sulphate of
potash. It was proved that on two successive evenings he gave her
a dose of two ounces of the salt; that she was seized after the first
dose with excessive and alarming sickness, from which, however, she
soon recovered without apparent harm; but that after the second
dose she had violent vomiting and profuse purging, of which she
died in five hours, without any alteration in the symptoms, except
that she became insensible for five minutes before death. The whole
gastro-intestinal mucous membrane was bright red, the vessels of the
brain were much congested, and between two and three ounces of
blood had escaped from the neighbourhood of the occipital sinus.
The salt had been swallowed in a single tumbler of water, so that
part of it was undissolved. Mr. Brande, who analyzed the sample
which had been used, found it free of all the ordinary irritant poisons.
Mr. Coward of Hoxton, to whom I owe the particulars of this singular
case, was of opinion, along with other medical gentlemen concerned
in it, that death arose from apoplexy brought on by the violent
and unceasing vomiting.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another cathartic, undoubtedly in general very mild in its action,
the <i>bitartrate of potash</i>, has also proved fatal, when taken in immoderate
quantity. Thus, a man, endeavouring to quench his thirst and
cool his stomach the morning after he had been drunk, ate a quarter
of a pound of this salt in lumps at once, and a good deal more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span>throughout the day afterwards. He was in consequence attacked
with incessant vomiting, frequent purging, and other signs of irritation
in the alimentary canal. He died on the third day; and the stomach
and bowels were found much inflamed.<a id='r1614' /><a href='#f1614' class='c013'><sup>[1614]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Even <i>common salt</i> has been known to act as a poison when taken
in large quantity. A striking instance of the kind occurred in London
in September, 1828. A man, who had been in the custom of
exhibiting various feats of gluttony, proposed to some of his comrades
one afternoon to sup a pound of <i>common salt</i> in a pint of ale, and actually
finished his nauseous dish, but not without being warned of
his imprudence by an attack of vomiting in the middle of it. He
was soon after seized with all the symptoms of irritant poisoning,
and died within twenty-four hours. The stomach and intestines
were found after death excessively inflamed.<a id='r1615' /><a href='#f1615' class='c013'><sup>[1615]</sup></a> This remarkable case
is not without its parallel. In 1839, a girl in the North of England
died in consequence of taking upwards of half a pound of salt as a
vermifuge.<a id='r1616' /><a href='#f1616' class='c013'><sup>[1616]</sup></a> Not long ago I met with an instance of somewhat
similar, but less violent effects. A student having taken upwards of
two ounces of salt as an emetic, dissolved in a small quantity of
water, was seized with acute burning pain in the stomach, tenderness
in the epigastrium and great anxiety, without any vomiting until he
drank a large quantity of warm water as a remedy. Before I saw
him he had vomited freely, but still suffered severe, intermitting pain,
which was removed by a large dose of muriate of morphia.</p>

<p class='c006'>In France, though not hitherto, so far as I know, in Britain, several
instances have occurred of extensive sickness in particular districts,
which have been traced to the accidental adulteration of <i>common salt</i>
with certain deleterious articles. In an investigation conducted by
M. Guibourt, in consequence of several severe accidents having been
produced apparently by salt in Paris and at Meaux, oxide of arsenic
was detected;<a id='r1617' /><a href='#f1617' class='c013'><sup>[1617]</sup></a> and this discovery was subsequently confirmed by
MM. Latour and Lefrançois, who ascertained that the proportion of
arsenic was sometimes a quarter of a grain per ounce.<a id='r1618' /><a href='#f1618' class='c013'><sup>[1618]</sup></a> Another
singular adulteration which appears fully more frequent is with hydriodate
of soda. At a meeting of the Parisian Academy of Medicine
in December, 1829, a report was read by MM. Boullay and
Delens, subsequent to an inquiry by M. Sérullas, into the nature of
a sample of salt which appears to have occasioned very extensive
ravages. In 1829, various epidemic sicknesses in certain parishes
were suspected to have arisen from salt of bad quality. In the month
of July no less than 150 persons in two parishes were attacked, some
with pain in the stomach, nausea, slimy and even bloody purging,
others with tension of the belly, puffiness of the face, inflammation
of the eyes and swelling of the legs; and in several parishes in the
Department of the Marne a sixth part of the population was similarly
affected. The salt being suspected to be the source of the mischief,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>as it had an unusual smell which some compared to the effluvia of
marshy ground, M. Sérullas analyzed it, and after him MM. Boullay
and Delens; and both analyses indicated the presence of a hundredth
of its weight of hydriodate of soda, besides a little free iodine.<a id='r1619' /><a href='#f1619' class='c013'><sup>[1619]</sup></a> Subsequently,
in reference to the discovery of arsenic by other chemists
in different samples of suspected salt, M. Sérullas repeated his analysis,
but could detect none of that poison.<a id='r1620' /><a href='#f1620' class='c013'><sup>[1620]</sup></a> Still more lately the
whole subject has been investigated with great care by M. Chevallier.<a id='r1621' /><a href='#f1621' class='c013'><sup>[1621]</sup></a>
M. Barruel states that he observed the occasional adulteration
of salt with some hydriodate accidentally in 1824, while preparing
experiments for Professor Orfila’s lectures. He found it in two samples
from different grocers’ shops in Paris.<a id='r1622' /><a href='#f1622' class='c013'><sup>[1622]</sup></a> No satisfactory explanation
has yet been given of the source of the adulteration with
arsenic; but the presence of hydriodate of soda has been traced to
the fraudulent use of impure salt from kelp [see p. <a href='#Page_160'>160</a>].</p>

<p class='c006'>Some difference of opinion prevails among toxicologists in regard
to the alleged deleterious qualities of <i>alum</i>. On the whole it scarcely
appears so active as to deserve the name of a poison; yet, like other
salts, it may in large doses do serious injury. It merits particular mention
among the present description of substances, partly on account
of a trial at Paris, where dangerous effects were alleged to have
been produced by it, and partly for the physiological inquiries made
on that occasion. A druggist supplied a lady by mistake with powder
of burnt alum instead of gum-arabic; and the lady, who had long laboured
under chronic derangement of the stomach and bowels, took a
single dose of a solution containing between ten and twenty grains of
the salt. She immediately complained of acute pain in the stomach and
gullet, burning in the mouth, and nausea; the symptoms of a severe attack
of inflammation in the stomach and bowels ensued; and she was
not considered out of danger for several days. The druggist was accordingly
prosecuted, and heavy damages claimed. The attending physician
ascribed the symptoms to the alum. But Marc and Orfila, who
were consulted, declared that this was impossible except on the supposition
that the lady had a very unusual sensibility of the stomach
to irritating substances;—that it was a common thing to give three,
four, and even five times the quantity in the treatment of diseases, without
any such consequences resulting;—and that at the very time of
the inquiry a physician in Paris was using it to the amount of six or
eight drachms in a day. From an experimental inquiry conducted by
Professor Orfila it appears, that large doses of calcined alum, such as
one or even two ounces, excite in dogs little more than one or two
attacks of vomiting, even although retained between ten and thirty
minutes,—that one ounce will not excite any marked symptoms
though secured in the stomach by a ligature,—but that two ounces
given in the same way prove fatal in five hours, under symptoms of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>excessive exhaustion and insensibility.<a id='r1623' /><a href='#f1623' class='c013'><sup>[1623]</sup></a> A similar inquiry was instituted
about the same time by M. Devergie, who seems, however, to
have remarked more activity in alum than is indicated by Orfila’s
experiments. He infers that two ounces may sometimes kill dogs,
even though they vomit freely; that half that quantity is fatal if the
gullet be tied; that calcined alum is more active than a solution of
the salt; that it is a corrosive or irritant; and that probably man is
more sensible to its operation than the lower animals.<a id='r1624' /><a href='#f1624' class='c013'><sup>[1624]</sup></a> Whatever
may be thought of the effects of alum on the animal body when administered
in large doses, it is plain from its frequent medicinal use
as an internal astringent that it is not poisonous when given in small
doses, like that taken by the patient in the trial alluded to. I may
add that it appears very doubtful whether any injury accrues from
the long-continued use of very small doses. Bakers, it is well known,
are in the practice of using it in minute proportion for improving the
whiteness of bread; and it has been imagined that chronic disorders
of the stomach and bowels may consequently originate, by reason of
its constipating tendency. These fears, however, are not borne out
by facts. Either the quantity is insufficient to do harm in the way
supposed; or the constitution becomes accustomed to the continual
operation of the salt, and does not suffer.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> <span class='small'>CLASS SECOND.<br /> OF NARCOTIC POISONS GENERALLY.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>The term narcotism has been used by different writers with different
significations, but is now generally understood to denote the
effects of such poisons as bring on a state of the system like that
caused by apoplexy, epilepsy, tetanus, and other disorders commonly
called nervous. Narcotic poisons, therefore, are such as produce
chiefly or solely symptoms of a disorder of the nervous system.</p>

<p class='c006'>The mode in which most narcotic poisons act has been well ascertained:
they act on the brain or spine or both by entering the blood-vessels.
Hence they are most active when most directly introduced
into the blood, that is, when injected into the veins; and when they
are applied to an entire membranous surface, their energy is in the
ratio of its absorbing power. Thus, when injected into the chest,
they act more rapidly than when swallowed. According to the
generally received opinion, they are conveyed with the blood to the
brain and spine on which they act. But, according to the views of
Messrs. Morgan and Addison, they produce on the inner coats of the
blood-vessels a peculiar impression, which is conveyed to the centre
of the nervous system along the nerves.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>The usual symptoms in man and the higher order of animals are
giddiness, headache, obscurity or deprivation of the sight, stupor or
perfect insensibility, palsy of the voluntary muscles or convulsions of
various kinds, and towards the close complete coma. The symptoms
of each poison are pretty uniform, when the dose is the same.
But each has its own peculiarities, either in the individual symptoms,
or in the mode in which they are combined together.</p>

<p class='c006'>The morbid appearances they leave in the dead body are commonly
insignificant. In the brain, where chiefly the physician is led
from the symptoms to expect unnatural appearances, the organs are
in general quite healthy. Sometimes, however, the veins are gorged
with blood, and the ventricles and membranes contain serosity. The
blood appears to be sometimes altered in nature; but the alteration
is by no means invariable, and sometimes none is remarked at all.
Many of the statements to be found in authors on the morbid appearances
caused by narcotics are far from being accurate.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before proceeding to notice the genera of this class in their order,
some remarks must be premised on the principal diseases which resemble
them in the symptoms and morbid appearances. Of these
the only diseases of much consequence are <i>apoplexy, epilepsy, inflammation
of the brain, hypertrophy of the brain, inflammation of the spinal
cord, and syncopal asphyxia</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of the Distinction between Apoplexy and Narcotic Poisoning.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'><i>Of the Symptoms.</i>—The symptoms of apoplexy are almost exactly
the same as those of the narcotic poisons, namely, more or less
complete abolition of sense and the power of motion, frequently
combined with convulsions. This disease commonly arises from
congestion or effusion of blood within the skull; but one variety of
it, the nervous apoplexy of older authors, or simple apoplexy of the
moderns, is believed to be an affection of the brain, unaccompanied
by any recognizable derangement of structure.</p>

<p class='c006'>Apoplexy and narcotic poisoning may be often distinguished by
the following criterions:</p>

<p class='c006'>1. Apoplexy is sometimes preceded at considerable intervals by
warning symptoms, such as giddiness, headache, ringing in the ears,
depraved vision, or partial palsy. But it is an error to suppose that
warning symptoms always occur; nay, if we may trust the experience
of M. Rochoux, they are by no means common: of sixty-three cases
which came under his notice nine only had distinct precursory symptoms.<a id='r1625' /><a href='#f1625' class='c013'><sup>[1625]</sup></a>
Poisoning with narcotics of course has not any precursory
symptom except by fortuitous combination. And consequently, if
warning symptoms have occurred, the presumption is, that the cause
of death is a natural one.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Apoplexy attacks chiefly the old. It is not, however, confined
to the old. On the trial of Captain Donnellan for poisoning Sir T.
Boughton, Mr. John Hunter mentioned that he had met with two instances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>of death from apoplexy in young women; my colleague Dr.
Alison has related to me a similar case; Professor Bernt has described
another of a young girl who died apoplectic from extravasation of
blood over the whole brain and in the ventricles also;<a id='r1626' /><a href='#f1626' class='c013'><sup>[1626]</sup></a> and Mr.
Greenhow, a surgeon of London, has even noticed a case of apoplexy
from effusion of blood over the surface of the brain in a child two
years and a half old.<a id='r1627' /><a href='#f1627' class='c013'><sup>[1627]</sup></a> On this subject the treatise of Rochoux supplies
excellent information: of his sixty-three cases sixty-one were
above thirty years of age, two less than thirty, none younger than
twenty.<a id='r1628' /><a href='#f1628' class='c013'><sup>[1628]</sup></a> It is plain, therefore, that apoplexy in young people is
rare. On the other hand, a great proportion of cases of poisoning
with the narcotics when they have been taken intentionally (and
such cases are most likely to lead to medico-legal questions), has occurred
among the young, especially of the female sex.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The next criterion is, that apoplexy occurs chiefly among fat
people. But it is here mentioned only that the medical jurist may
be cautioned against the belief that it is in all circumstances a correct
criterion. Upon this particular Rochoux has furnished some satisfactory
data. Among his sixty-three patients thirty were of an ordinary
habit, twenty-three were of a thin, meager habit, and ten only
were large, plethoric and fat.<a id='r1629' /><a href='#f1629' class='c013'><sup>[1629]</sup></a> In receiving this statement, however,
it is necessary to consider, that although the vulgar idea, that most
apoplectic people are fat, does not apply to persons in the rank of
Rochoux’s patients, who were mostly hospital inmates, yet it may
apply better to the upper ranks. For the same circumstances which
predispose to apoplexy, namely, great strength, vigorous constitution
and good digestive powers, likewise predispose to corpulency, so that
whenever the condition of life permits the disposition to corpulency
to be developed, the connexion of apoplexy with it will appear.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. A fourth criterion is drawn from the relation which the appearance
of the symptoms bears to the last article of food or drink
that was taken. I believe that the effects of the common narcotics,
in the cases where they prove fatal, begin not later than an hour, or
at the utmost two hours, after they are taken; and in a great majority
of instances they begin in a much shorter time, namely, in
fifteen or thirty minutes. Hence if it can be proved that the nervous
symptoms, under which a person died, did not begin till several
hours after he took food, drink or medicine, it appears almost, if
not absolutely certain, that a narcotic poison cannot have been the
cause of death. To some narcotic, or rather narcotico-acrid poisons
this rule certainly will not apply, such as the poisonous fungi and
spurred rye; which seldom begin to act for several hours, sometimes
for not less than a day and a half. Neither will the rule apply to
poisoning with the deleterious gases, as their action has no connexion
at all with eating or drinking. But these facts do not form a material
objection to the rule laid down; because the circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>under which cases of the kind occur are generally so apparent, as at
once to point out their real nature to a careful inquirer.</p>

<p class='c006'>In regard to apoplexy as the disease which resembles most closely
the effects of the narcotics, it was formerly stated that this disease is
apt to occur soon or immediately after taking a meal (p. <a href='#Page_95'>95</a>).<a id='r1630' /><a href='#f1630' class='c013'><sup>[1630]</sup></a> In
the greater number of such cases, however, where the meal has been
the exciting cause of the disease, the symptoms have begun <i>immediately</i>
after, or even during a meal. This is very rarely the case
with the symptoms of narcotic poisoning, and never happens in respect
to those of the commonest of the narcotics, opium: An interval
of 10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes always occurs. The deleterious gases
and hydrocyanic acid, with its compounds, are the only familiar narcotic
poisons which act more swiftly.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Another criterion relates to the progress of the symptoms. The
symptoms of narcotic poisoning advance for the most part gradually:
but those of apoplexy in general begin abruptly. Sometimes apoplexy
commences at once with deep sopor. Narcotic poisoning
never begins in that way, except in the instances of hydrocyanic acid
and the narcotic gases; the sopor is at first imperfect, and it increases
gradually, though sometimes very rapidly. Apoplexy, however,
does not always begin with deep sopor; occasionally the sopor
begins and increases like that of narcotism.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. Although there is a great resemblance between the symptoms
of apoplexy and those of narcotism, so far as regards their general
features, there are particulars which are not indeed always present,
but which when present will help to distinguish the one from the
other. When the sopor of apoplexy is completely formed, it is
rarely possible to rouse the patient to consciousness, and never, I
believe, where the risk of confounding apoplexy with poisoning is
greatest,—in the cases where death happens neither instantly, nor
after the interval of a day, but in a few hours. On the other hand,
in many cases of poisoning with the narcotics, and particularly with
the commonest variety, opium, the person may be roused from the
deepest lethargy, if he is spoken to in a loud voice, or forcibly shaken
for some time, or if water is injected into his ear. Even in cases of
poisoning with opium, however, the coma may have continued too
long to admit of this temporary restoration to sense; the susceptibility
of being roused is not so often remarked in other varieties of
narcotic poisoning; and in some, such as poisoning with prussic
acid, I am not aware that it has ever been remarked, at least in
fatal cases.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are some other symptoms which in special cases may help
to distinguish narcotic poisoning from apoplexy. Thus in poisoning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span>with opium convulsions are rare; in apoplexy they are common
enough. Bloating of the countenance is likewise much more common
in apoplexy than in poisoning with opium. In apoplexy, too,
the pupil is generally dilated, while in poisoning with opium the
pupil is almost always contracted. But such distinctions do not
apply either to the narcotics as a class, or to all cases of any one kind
of narcotic poisoning.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. In the last place, a useful criterion may be derived from the
duration of the symptoms in fatal cases. I believe few people die
of pure narcotic poisoning who outlive twelve hours; and the
greater number die much sooner,—in eight, or six hours. Apoplexy
often lasts a whole day, or even longer. On the other hand,
the narcotic poisons very rarely prove so rapidly fatal as apoplexy
sometimes does. Apoplexy, according to the vulgar opinion, may
prove fatal instantly or in a few minutes. The only late author of
repute who maintains that opinion is M. Devergie. He mentions
the case of an elderly man subject to somnolency, who, after complaining
for a short time of headache, became suddenly pale, hung
down his head, and expired immediately, and in whose body no
other morbid appearance was found, except great congestion of the
cerebral membranes.<a id='r1631' /><a href='#f1631' class='c013'><sup>[1631]</sup></a> The best modern pathologists, however, deny
that apoplexy proves immediately fatal, and maintain with much
apparent reason that when death is so sudden, the cause is commonly
disease of the heart, and not apoplexy.<a id='r1632' /><a href='#f1632' class='c013'><sup>[1632]</sup></a> However this may
be, it is at all events certain that apoplexy may occasion death in
considerably less than an hour. Now the only narcotics in common
use which can prove fatal so soon are the narcotic gases, and prussic
acid. As to opium, the most common of the narcotic poisons, and
by far the most important to the medical jurist, the shortest duration
I have yet seen recorded is three hours. Apoplexy often proves
fatal in a much shorter time.</p>

<p class='c006'>From this enumeration of the criterions between apoplexy and the
symptoms produced by narcotics, the toxicologist will conclude, that
few cases can occur in which he will not be able to give a presumptive
opinion of the real cause from the symptoms only,—that in
many instances a diagnosis may be drawn with an approach to certainty,—and
that on all occasions it will be possible to say without
risk of error, whether there are materials for forming a diagnosis at
all,—a point which is of great moment when the criterions are not
universally applicable.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of the Morbid Appearances.</i>—The next subject of inquiry is the
distinction between apoplexy and narcotic poisoning, as to the appearances
after death. It has been already stated, that the narcotic
poisons rarely produce very distinct morbid appearances,—that the
greatest extent of unnatural appearance they cause in the brain is
congestion of vessels,—and that the physical qualities of the blood
appear to be altered, though not invariably.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_515'>515</span><i>Of Simple Apoplexy.</i>—Apoplexy may, in the first place, occasion
death without leaving any sign at all in the dead body. Cases of
this sort were called nervous apoplexy by the older authors; but for
the purpose of avoiding a name that involves a theory as to their
nature, they have been more appropriately termed by Dr. Abercrombie
simple apoplexy. At one time they were believed to be
common. The researches of modern pathologists, however, have
shown that they are rare, and that the apparent absence of morbid
appearances may be often with justice ascribed to an insufficient examination;
for it is not always easy to detect, without minute attention,
two disorders little known till in recent times, and sometimes
closely allied in their symptoms to apoplexy,—hypertrophy
of the brain, and inflammation of its substance. On this account
some have even gone so far as to deny altogether the existence of
simple or nervous apoplexy; and M. Rostan, who is of this opinion,
has supported it by the fact, that in the course of his pathological
researches he had examined no less than 4000 heads, and never
met with an instance of it.<a id='r1633' /><a href='#f1633' class='c013'><sup>[1633]</sup></a> But although this statement, made by
so eminent a pathologist, is sufficient to prove the rarity of the disease,
it does not establish its non-existence in the face of positive
observations, made by others after the phenomena and effects of
cerebral inflammation were well known.</p>

<p class='c006'>Among the modern authorities to whom reference may here be
made for examples of simple apoplexy, Dr. Abercrombie, M. Louis,
my colleague Dr. Alison, and M. Lobstein, may be particularized.
Dr. Abercrombie has seen four cases,<a id='r1634' /><a href='#f1634' class='c013'><sup>[1634]</sup></a> M. Louis has recorded three,<a id='r1635' /><a href='#f1635' class='c013'><sup>[1635]</sup></a>
M. Lobstein one,<a id='r1636' /><a href='#f1636' class='c013'><sup>[1636]</sup></a> and Dr. Alison informs me, that he has seen one
and got the particulars of another from the late Dr. Gregory. In
several of these cases the individuals were at the time of the apoplectic
seizure affected with other diseases, such as asthma, anasarca,
or slight febrile symptoms; but in four of them the coma commenced
during a state of perfect health. I have myself seen two of the former
class, one occurring during convalescence from a slight pleurisy,
the other terminating a complicated case of pulmonary emphysema
and catarrh, diseased kidneys and anasarca. Reference may be also
made under this head to several cases of apoplexy described in Corvisart’s
Journal, as connected with the enormous accumulation of
worms in the intestines. Such a connexion is said to be common on
the coast of Brittany; and one striking instance is related of a young
man, who, after an attack of headache, vomiting, and loss of speech,
died comatose in two days, and in whose body no unnatural appearance
could be seen except a prodigious mass of worms in the small
intestines.<a id='r1637' /><a href='#f1637' class='c013'><sup>[1637]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In none of all the cases of apoplexy now under consideration was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span>there found within the head any appearance corresponding with the
symptoms, except occasionally a slight turgescence of vessels.</p>

<p class='c006'>This form of apoplexy, then, is a very important affection in a
medico-legal point of view. The possibility of its occurrence is in
fact the chief obstacle, which, in many cases involving the question
of poisoning with narcotics, prevents the physician from coming to a
positive decision on a review merely of symptoms and appearances
after death. Instances will occur where it is impossible to draw a
diagnosis between the natural and the violent form of death. And
indeed it might even be a fair subject of inquiry, whether death from
at least some narcotic poisons, such as opium, is any thing else than
death from simple apoplexy.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be mentioned,—although too much importance ought not
to be attached to the fact, as forming the ground of a diagnosis in
certain rapid cases of narcotic poisoning,—that of the instances of
simple apoplexy referred to above none proved fatal in less than five
hours. This was Dr. Gregory’s case. Dr. Alison’s proved fatal in
seven hours; M. Louis’s cases in eight, nine, and ten hours; one of
Dr. Abercrombie’s in eight hours; the three others in about twenty-four
hours; and M. Lobstein’s in five days.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another consideration is, that simple apoplexy is undoubtedly very
rare, more particularly in persons who enjoy perfect health. Hence,
although it is impossible to distinguish the effects of narcotics from
this disease by the appearances in the body after death, yet, when
the general evidence of poisoning is strong, and none of the medical
circumstances are at variance with the supposition of narcotic poisoning,
the evidence of poisoning, as judged of by the jury from the
whole facts, medical and general, will be commonly sufficient,—so
far as regards the possibility of death from simple apoplexy. For
such a concurrence of circumstances as is here supposed can scarcely
be outweighed by a mere possibility of death from so rare a natural
disease.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is worthy of remark, in reference to charges and suspicions of
poisoning during a state of ill health, that simple apoplexy occurring
in the course of a considerable period of indifferent health is far
from uncommon. Such incidents, however, ought not to be confounded
with narcotic poisoning, because the coma comes on gradually.
From what I have myself frequently observed, cases of this
nature are often connected with the granular disintegration of the
kidneys, which has been brought under the notice of physicians by
the able researches of Dr. Bright. I have related two instances of
the kind,<a id='r1638' /><a href='#f1638' class='c013'><sup>[1638]</sup></a> and several others have been since published by Dr.
James Arthur Wilson.<a id='r1639' /><a href='#f1639' class='c013'><sup>[1639]</sup></a> In none of these could there have been any
risk of mistaking the phenomena for narcotic poisoning. But it
may be well to advert to the subject here for the sake of turning the
attention of the profession to the propriety of examining the state of
the kidneys in all medico-legal cases of death in a state of coma.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span><i>Of Congestive Apoplexy.</i>—Apoplexy may, in the second place,
leave in the dead body no other sign but congestion of vessels within
the head. This form or variety of apoplexy is so generally admitted,
that it is hardly necessary to mention special instances. But, for the
sake of those who may prefer special facts to general propositions,
the two following cases by M. Rostan are referred to. One of his
patients, without any precursory symptom, was suddenly deprived
of sense, soon became delirious and comatose, and expired in a day
and a half. The other, also without any previous symptom, became
rapidly comatose, and died in twenty-four hours. In both the whole
membranes were minutely injected with blood; and in one the
whole brain had also a rose-red colour.<a id='r1640' /><a href='#f1640' class='c013'><sup>[1640]</sup></a> In regard to the diagnosis
between such cases and poisoning with narcotics, it must be remembered,
that congestion of the cerebral vessels is considered by many
a common effect of such poisons, and that therefore the diagnosis
cannot be rested on the appearances in the dead body. I have not
perused a sufficient number of fatal cases of congestive apoplexy to
enable me to attempt a diagnosis; but, so far as I have gone, it appears
to me, that this form of the disease, which is not often fatal
without extravasation also being produced, does not cause death till
after an interval of nearly a day at least. Should this prove a general
fact, it would form the ground of a diagnosis between congestive
apoplexy and many forms of narcotic poisoning, which, if death
ensues, prove fatal much sooner.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of Serous Apoplexy.</i>—Apoplexy may, in the third place, produce
serous effusion on the external surface, and in the ventricles of the
brain. This form of the disease, which has been named serous apoplexy,
although not very uncommon as an insulated affection, is for
the most part united with inflammation of the cerebral substance.
Serous effusion is more frequently the termination of an inflammatory
disorder of the brain, than of that deranged state which constitutes
the apoplectic attack. But nevertheless it does occur in connexion
with pure apoplexy, as may be seen, for example, on referring to Dr.
Abercrombie’s work,<a id='r1641' /><a href='#f1641' class='c013'><sup>[1641]</sup></a> or to Bernt’s Contributions to Medical Jurisprudence,<a id='r1642' /><a href='#f1642' class='c013'><sup>[1642]</sup></a>
or to the Hospital Reports of Dr. Bright.<a id='r1643' /><a href='#f1643' class='c013'><sup>[1643]</sup></a> In such cases
the only appearances have been the effusion of an unusual quantity of
serum on the surface of the brain, in its ventricles, and in the base
of the skull. Cases of this sort agree very exactly as to the signs in
the dead body with some cases of narcotic poisoning. When serous
effusion is preceded by decided apoplectic symptoms, the disease,
so far as I have been able to inquire, is always of several days’ duration.
But sometimes the symptoms are to the very last obscure and
different from those of apoplexy, as in an instance related by Dr.
Abercrombie.<a id='r1644' /><a href='#f1644' class='c013'><sup>[1644]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of Apoplexy from extravasation.</i>—The last variety of apoplexy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_518'>518</span>is that which leaves in the dead body extravasation of blood within
the head. This, the most common of all its forms, is very rarely
imitated by narcotic poisoning. A case, however, will be afterwards
mentioned of extravasation produced apparently by poisoning with
opium, another of extravasation caused by carbonic acid, another by
poisonous fungus, and several by spirits. The existence, therefore,
of extravasated blood is not absolutely certain proof, but supplies,
in relation to most narcotics, a strong presumption of natural death.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here it will be necessary to add a word or two of caution regarding
what are called apoplectic cells or cavities, containing blood in
the brain. If an apoplectic cell be found, it must not be at once considered
as the cause of death. When blood is extravasated in the
brain, the patient may gradually recover altogether, and the cell nevertheless
continue full. Such persons often die of a subsequent
attack of apoplexy, or of inflammation around the cell. We can
say with certainty, that an apoplectic cell has been the occasion of
death only when the blood is recent, or when it is surrounded by
signs of recent inflammation.</p>

<p class='c006'>So much, then, as to the criterions derived from morbid appearances
within the skull, for distinguishing poisoning with narcotics
from apoplexy.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been proposed to derive other criterions from the state of
the blood. But on considering the effects of the individual poisons
of the class, it will appear that the state of the blood is by no means
characteristic.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be useful to conclude this view of the distinctions between
poisoning and apoplexy with the particulars of an interesting case, in
which the medical witnesses fell into an egregious error by disregarding
the most palpable criterions. In 1841, an elderly gentleman at Chambéry
in France, subject to apoplexy, one day after having made a hearty
dinner and afterwards supped on bread, cheese, and white wine, was
suddenly seized with staggering immediately after finishing his wine,
and soon lost all consciousness. Emetics and stimulants restored his
faculties so far as to enable him to say he felt better and had no pain;
but the tongue and mouth were drawn to the left side, and there was
great prostration. Four hours after his first seizure the countenance
became livid; he again became unconscious and insensible; the
twisting of the mouth increased; and the left arm presented spasmodic
contraction. Blood-letting and other remedies were resorted
to without avail; the pulse, previously strong and regular, became
gradually feeble; and in six hours after his first illness he expired,
without ever having had convulsions of any kind. On the body
being examined seven days after death, great congestion was found
in the vessels on the surface of the brain; on raising the brain, a
dense dark clot of the size of a large egg escaped from the lower part of
the ventricles; and an abundant extravasation of the same nature
was found under the <i>tentorium cerebelli</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>It appears scarcely possible to find a more characteristic case than
this of apoplexy from extravasation. The slight intermission in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_519'>519</span>symptoms was the only unusual circumstance. Yet because the inspectors
remarked in various parts of the body a peculiar odour, which
they could not at the time characterise, but which they afterwards
thought was the odour of bitter almonds,—and misled by the sudden
invasion of the symptoms instantly after a meal,—they gave their
opinion that death had arisen from some narcotic poison; a chemical
examination was made of various textures of the body (not, however,
of the contents of the stomach), which yielded obscure and very
doubtful indications of hydrocyanic acid; poisoning with hydrocyanic
acid was accordingly declared to have been the cause of death;
and, in defiance of an able report by Professor Orfila, pointing out
the error of the primary witnesses, the nephew and heir of the deceased
was condemned.<a id='r1645' /><a href='#f1645' class='c013'><sup>[1645]</sup></a> It is almost unnecessary to point out the
impossibility of death having arisen in this case from hydrocyanic
acid. The length of time the deceased survived, the want of convulsions,
the presence of deflexion of the mouth and tongue, the intermission
of the symptoms, and the morbid appearances, all clearly
indicate that death in the way supposed was impossible; and the
chemical evidence, which it would require too much space to analyze
here, was proved by Orfila to be completely unsatisfactory.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of the Distinction between Epilepsy and Narcotic Poisoning.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'><i>Of the Symptoms.</i>—Epilepsy is distinguished from other diseases
by the abolition of sense and by convulsions. It resembles closely
the symptoms caused by prussic acid, and by some of the narcotic
gases, such as carbonic acid gas and the asphyxiating gas of privies. It
also bears the same resemblance to the effects of many narcotico-acrid
poisons, such as belladonna, stramonium, hemlock, and others
of the first group of that class, also camphor, cocculus indicus, and
the poisonous fungi.</p>

<p class='c006'>Epilepsy is in general a chronic disease, and for the most part ends
slowly in insanity. But sometimes it proves fatal during a paroxysm.
The circumstances by which an epileptic fit may be distinguished
from narcotic poisoning are the following:</p>

<p class='c006'>1. The epileptic fit <i>is sometimes preceded by certain warnings</i>, such
as stupor, a sense of coldness, or creeping, or of a gentle breeze proceeding
from a particular part of the body towards the head. Warnings,
however, are by no means universal. M. Georget, indeed, has
even stated that they do not occur in more than five cases in the hundred.<a id='r1646' /><a href='#f1646' class='c013'><sup>[1646]</sup></a>
But this estimate probably underrates their frequency.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The symptoms of the epileptic fit <i>almost always begin violently
and abruptly</i>. The individual is suddenly observed to cry out, often
to vomit, and instantly falls down in convulsions. The effects of the
narcotic poisons, if we except some cases of poisoning with hydrocyanic
acid, the narcotic gases, and a few rare alkaloids, never begin
otherwise than gradually, though their progress towards their extreme
<span class='pageno' id='Page_520'>520</span>of violence is often rapid. This distinction is generally an excellent
one. But it will not apply so well to some cases of epilepsy in which
the convulsions are trivial. Esquirol says an epileptic fit may consist
of nothing more than coma, with convulsive movements of the
eyes, or lips, or chest, or a single finger.<a id='r1647' /><a href='#f1647' class='c013'><sup>[1647]</sup></a> Still even then the coma
generally begins abruptly, so that if the case is seen from the beginning,
it can hardly be mistaken for narcotic poisoning. Some forms
of epilepsy, in which the fit is constituted merely by giddiness, staring,
wandering of the mind, and imperfect loss of recollection,<a id='r1648' /><a href='#f1648' class='c013'><sup>[1648]</sup></a> might be
confounded with the milder forms of narcotic poisoning. But collateral
circumstances will scarcely ever be wanting to distinguish such
cases from one another.</p>

<p class='c006'>The varieties of narcotic poisoning which, in the violence and abruptness
of their commencement, bear the closest resemblance to an
epileptic attack, are some cases of poisoning with hydrocyanic acid
or with the deleterious gases. Both of these varieties, however,
when they begin so abruptly, are distinguished from a fatal paroxysm
of epilepsy by the fourth characteristic to be mentioned presently; and
besides, in abrupt cases of poisoning with hydrocyanic acid, the poison
under certain conditions will be found in the body; while in
sudden poisoning with the narcotic gases, the nature of the accident
is rendered obvious to a cautious inquirer by the collateral circumstances.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. As in apoplexy, so in epilepsy the patient <i>in general cannot be
roused</i> by external stimuli. This, as already observed, is often, although
certainly not always, practicable in cases of poisoning with
narcotics. Sometimes, too, in the epileptic fit a partial restoration
of consciousness may be effected by loud speaking, so that in reply
to questions the patient will roll his eyes or move his lips. It is
therefore to be understood in applying the present criterion, that it is
only a safe guide when, as in many cases of poisoning with opium,
the individual can be roused to a state of tolerably perfect consciousness.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. When a person dies in a fit of epilepsy, <i>the paroxysm generally
lasts long</i>, sometimes more than a day. So far as I have been able
to ascertain (though on this point it must be confessed authors are
singularly silent), it never proves fatal in a shorter time than several
hours, unless there have been many previous fits; and even then it
rarely proves fatal more rapidly. I have met with a case which,
after many previous fits, proved fatal in little more than an hour.<a id='r1649' /><a href='#f1649' class='c013'><sup>[1649]</sup></a> In
an instance mentioned by Mr. Clifton of irregularly recurring epilepsy,
the patient after being exempt for four months was attacked twice
a day for four days, and during an interval of ease fell down in the
street and died. General congestion and excessive softening of the
brain were found.<a id='r1650' /><a href='#f1650' class='c013'><sup>[1650]</sup></a> I have met with a case very like this, where
death was owing to enormous extravasation of blood into the ventricles.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_521'>521</span>So rapid a termination never occurs except after several paroxysms;
and probably never without well-marked appearances in the dead
body. The variety of poisoning with which epilepsy is most apt to
be confounded, poisoning with hydrocyanic acid, has hitherto always
proved fatal within three-quarters of an hour, and can probably never
prove fatal so late as a whole hour after the symptoms begin, unless
the dose has been small and given repeatedly. Poisoning with the
gas of privies,—another variety, which sometimes imitates precisely
a fit of epilepsy, appears not to prove fatal in its convulsive form later
than two hours after the exposure.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. M. Esquirol, a writer of high authority, says that epilepsy <i>very
rarely proves fatal in the first paroxysm</i>. I suspect it may be said
that the first paroxysm never proves fatal. For the cases considered
and described as such have been either inflammation of the brain or
its membranes, or hypertrophy of the brain, or inflammation of the
spinal cord, or effusion of serum or blood into the spinal canal, or
worms in the intestines,—all of which may be known by the morbid
appearances. I have also seen cases of continued fever with
typhomania and convulsions, which might have been considered by
a careless observer examples of epilepsy fatal in the first fit. On the
present characteristic it would be wrong to speak with confidence,
as the question regarding the possible fatality of epilepsy in the first
fit must depend greatly on the degree of extension given to the term
epilepsy. I can only say, that in the course of reading I have not
hitherto met with an instance fatal in the first paroxysm, which might
not have been referred by the morbid appearances to one or other of
the diseases mentioned above.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of the Morbid Appearances.</i>—With regard to the morbid appearances
found in the bodies of epileptics, much difference of opinion
prevails among pathologists. The most frequent are tumours within
the cranium, excrescences from the bone or dura mater, concretions
in the brain itself, or abscesses there, and effusion into the ventricles
or on the surface of the brain. Other appearances which have also
been remarked are probably little connected with the disease; and at
all events have been often seen when epilepsy did not precede death.<a id='r1651' /><a href='#f1651' class='c013'><sup>[1651]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The morbid appearances connected with epilepsy are not always
to be looked for within the head. The cause which produces the
fit is often some irritation in distant organs.—The presence of
worms in the intestines of children may occasion fatal epilepsy. It
is believed also that they may cause fatal epilepsy even in adults;
and whether their presence has been the cause of death or not, it is
certain that they have been found enormously accumulated in the
stomach or intestines of adult epileptic subjects.<a id='r1652' /><a href='#f1652' class='c013'><sup>[1652]</sup></a> The most recent
information on this subject is furnished by M. Gaultier de Claubry.
In a girl seven years old, who died of convulsions in six days, he
found eleven <i>lumbrici</i> in the general cavity of the belly, and the coats
<span class='pageno' id='Page_522'>522</span>of the stomach perforated with holes, in some of which other worms
were sticking. In another child of the same age, who died in seven
days of convulsions, he found thirty-six worms in the peritoneal sac, a
great mass of them in the stomach, and twenty-seven making their
way through holes in its coats.<a id='r1653' /><a href='#f1653' class='c013'><sup>[1653]</sup></a> In a singular case related by M.
Lepelletier of a boy twelve years old, who died of convulsions in
four days, the only morbid appearance found was a perforation of the
gullet six lines in diameter, through which two lumbrici had made
their way into a cavity in the middle right lobe of the lungs, while
another was sticking in the hole, six more occupied the lower part
of the gullet, and three lay in the stomach.<a id='r1654' /><a href='#f1654' class='c013'><sup>[1654]</sup></a>—The irritation of
teething may also excite epilepsy, and in cases where it has proved fatal
may be recognized by the redness and swelling of the gum, by the
tooth being on the point of piercing the alveolar process, and by the
turgescence of vessels around.<a id='r1655' /><a href='#f1655' class='c013'><sup>[1655]</sup></a>—A well-known but rather rare
cause is the presence of some hard substance in the course of a nerve.
This variety, like those already mentioned, may prove fatal in the
fit, as appears from the following interesting case. A stout young
woman became suddenly liable to epilepsy, and, after suffering repeated
fits in the course of twenty months, died comatose in a paroxysm
of thirty-three hours’ duration. The fits having always begun
with acute pain in a particular part of the thigh, this part of the body
was carefully examined, and a bony tumour as big as a nut was found
on a branch of the sciatic nerve.<a id='r1656' /><a href='#f1656' class='c013'><sup>[1656]</sup></a>—Other appearances might likewise
be here enumerated, which have been supposed the cause of symptomatic
epilepsy.<a id='r1657' /><a href='#f1657' class='c013'><sup>[1657]</sup></a> But few of these have been so thoroughly ascertained
as to be allowed much influence on a medico-legal opinion.</p>

<p class='c006'>It cannot, I apprehend, be denied, that in many cases of epilepsy
no decided morbid appearance is to be found in the body; and that
in many others the appearances are either so equivocal as not to be
satisfactorily recognized in any circumstances, or so hidden in their
situation that they may escape notice, unless the inspector’s attention
be drawn to the particular spot by a knowledge of the symptoms.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hence in actual questions as to the occurrence of narcotic poisoning
when the symptoms resemble epilepsy, it will be seldom possible
to found on the absence of morbid appearances more than a presumptive
opinion that death did not proceed from the natural cause. It
is right to remember, however, that in considering the absence of
morbid appearances in reference to the diagnosis of narcotic poisoning
and epilepsy, the attention should be confined to cases of epilepsy
which prove fatal during the fit. Now I suspect no such case ever
occurs, at least in adults, without an adequate cause being discoverable
in the dead body, either in the head, or in the course of some
nerve, or in the accumulation of worms in the intestines. This
statement must not be considered as made with confidence; but it
deserves investigation.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_523'>523</span>From all that has now been said on the subject of epilepsy as a
disease which imitates many varieties of narcotic poisoning, the
medical jurist will probably arrive at the conclusion, that, although
a diagnosis cannot always be drawn with certainty, yet in numerous
cases the consideration of the symptoms and appearances after death
will enable him to say positively that poisoning is out of the question,
and in many others that poisoning is highly probable.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of the Distinction between Meningitis and Narcotic Poisoning.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Inflammation of the inner membranes of the brain, which constitutes
the <i>acute hydrocephalus</i> or acute <i>meningitis</i> of authors, is not
in general apt to cause much ambiguity; for its progress is commonly
gradual, well-marked and less rapid than most cases of narcotic
poisoning: and the appearances in the dead body, such as effusion
of serum, lymph or pus on the outer surface of the brain or in the
ventricles, are for the most part obvious.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Abercrombie, however, has described a form of it occurring
among children during the existence of other diseases, particularly of
the chest, which might be the cause of perplexity; for its course is
sometimes finished within a day, its symptoms are delirium, convulsions
and coma intermingled, and the only morbid appearance is
congestion of vessels on the surface and in the substance of the
brain.<a id='r1658' /><a href='#f1658' class='c013'><sup>[1658]</sup></a> The affection now alluded to imitates closely, both in its
progress and in its signs after death, some varieties of poisoning
with the vegetable narcotico-acrids, such as belladonna, stramonium,
and hemlock. But the latter cases, when they prove fatal, seldom
last nearly so long as a day, while the instances of meningitis under
consideration rarely cause death within twenty-four hours. Dr.
Abercrombie also notices a parallel disease occurring among adults;
but it is in them always marked by a considerably longer, though
often more obscure course.<a id='r1659' /><a href='#f1659' class='c013'><sup>[1659]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Bright takes notice of a similar affection under the title of
“Arachnitis with excessive irritability” occurring chiefly among
very intemperate people, but independently of previous disease. In
general the disorder has a well-marked course of at least several
days’ duration. But in two of the instances he has given the early
stage was very obscure, the only symptoms having been headache and
sickness of no great severity for four or five days; after which
delirium came suddenly on, and was followed by coma, and by death
within thirty-six or forty hours. The sole appearances found within
the head were some serous effusion and vascularity on the surface of
the brain and in the ventricles.<a id='r1660' /><a href='#f1660' class='c013'><sup>[1660]</sup></a> To these illustrations may be added
the heads of a remarkable case which occurred here in the person of
an eminent lawyer, and for the particulars of which I am indebted
to Dr. Maclagan. For three days there had been occasional headache,
not great enough to prevent him pursuing his ordinary avocations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_524'>524</span>yet becoming so troublesome on the morning of the third day
as to induce him to have leeches applied. But next morning he
was seized rather suddenly with quickly increasing coma, and in
forty hours more he expired. In this instance the whole surface of
the arachnoid membrane, both over the hemisphere and in the ventricles,
was found lined with soft, yellowish-green lymph.</p>

<p class='c006'>In such cases it is apparent that an inspection after death will often
unfold their real nature, where the history of the symptoms may leave
it in doubt. But even without an inspection it is not likely that a
careful physician could mistake them for narcotic poisoning; for independently
of other considerations, the severe symptoms are ushered
in by a precursory stage of ill health, commonly indicating an obscure
affection of the head, and such as no one but a careless observer
could fail to discover and appreciate.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not improbable, however, that acute meningitis may seem to
prove suddenly fatal, in consequence of its course being in a great
measure latent. The following case reported by Mr. Davies of
Somers Town, seems of this nature. A woman, who had previously
complained only of slight headache, was attacked after breakfast
with violent vomiting for half an hour, when she fell down, and immediately
expired. After death there was found great gorging of
the vessels of the cerebral membranes, with opacity and thickening
of the pia mater and arachnoid coats, and an effusion of nearly five
ounces of bloody serum under the dura mater.<a id='r1661' /><a href='#f1661' class='c013'><sup>[1661]</sup></a> Such a case might
give rise to great perplexity in a charge of poisoning, until the examination
of the body unfolded its true nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>I should scarcely have thought it necessary to mention <i>chronic
meningitis</i> among the diseases apt to imitate the effects of narcotic
poisons, because it is commonly marked by a long and distinct
course. But the following case, for which I am indebted to Dr.
Arnoldi of Montreal, will show that, like other diseases of the head,
chronic meningitis may be latent in its early stage, and may, after
developing itself, terminate in a day, and then in some measure imitate
poisoning with narcotics. A middle-aged female, subject for a
twelvemonth to a purulent discharge from the left ear, and occasional
headache, which was supposed to be rheumatic, was seized
one morning with acute pain in the head, followed in a few hours by
convulsions and tendency to coma; under which symptoms she died
within twenty hours, although treated actively from the commencement.
On dissection, the brain and pia mater were found healthy,
except at the part corresponding with the petrous portion of the left
temporal bone, where the brain was a little softened. The corresponding
part of the temporal bone and the adjacent part of the occipital
were completely denuded and covered with pus, which had
established a passage for itself into the cavity of the ear.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of the Distinction between Inflammation of the Brain and Narcotic Poisoning.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Inflammation of the brain itself, the <i>ramollissement</i> of French
<span class='pageno' id='Page_525'>525</span>writers, occasionally excites symptoms not unlike those produced
by some narcotic poisons; and in a few instances its course has
appeared to be equally short. It requires particular notice, because
the appearances left in the dead body are sometimes apt to escape
observation.</p>

<p class='c006'>This disease in its well-marked form has been noticed by various
authors from Morgagni downwards. But the first regular accounts
of it were given in 1818 by Dr. Abercrombie,<a id='r1662' /><a href='#f1662' class='c013'><sup>[1662]</sup></a> and in 1819 by M.
Rostan<a id='r1663' /><a href='#f1663' class='c013'><sup>[1663]</sup></a> of Paris, and Professor Lallemand<a id='r1664' /><a href='#f1664' class='c013'><sup>[1664]</sup></a> of Montpellier. Its
symptoms are allied to those of apoplexy and epilepsy. But the
comatose state is generally preceded by delirium or imperfect palsy,
and often by a febrile state of the circulation. Contraction of the
voluntary muscles, once supposed to be a distinguishing sign of this
disease, is neither essential nor peculiar to it. In the dead body it
is recognized by the presence either of an abscess in the brain,—or
more commonly of a nucleus of disorganized cerebral tissue surrounded
by unnatural redness or softness,—or sometimes of a clot
of blood surrounded by similar softening. Occasionally, when the
disease kills in its early stage, nothing is found but redness of a part
of the brain, and slight softening of the tissue, recognizable only by
scraping it with the edge of the scalpel.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the form in which it is commonly seen, and as described by
Rostan and Lallemand from a great number of cases, it can hardly
be confounded with the effects of narcotic poisons; for its course is
much slower, being seldom less than several days when it proves
fatal.<a id='r1665' /><a href='#f1665' class='c013'><sup>[1665]</sup></a> Yet in some instances it may prove fatal instantly. Lancisi
notices the case of an Italian nobleman, who after an apoplectic fit
became liable to frequent attacks of lethargy,—who at length died
quite suddenly more than a year afterwards,—and in whose brain an
organized clot was found, with extensive suppuration of the brain
around it.<a id='r1666' /><a href='#f1666' class='c013'><sup>[1666]</sup></a> An unequivocal case of the same kind has been related
by Mr. Dickson, a navy-surgeon. An elderly sailor, who for months
before had done duty, eaten his rations, and drunk his grog as usual,
suddenly dropped down while in the act of pulling his oar, and died
at once; and after death there was found in the middle lobes of the
brain an extensive abscess, which had made its way to the surface.<a id='r1667' /><a href='#f1667' class='c013'><sup>[1667]</sup></a>
Such cases might, in certain circumstances, be mistaken for the
effects of large doses of hydrocyanic acid; but the morbid appearances
are of course quite characteristic. M. Louis has related an
instance like the last two, but where the disease was altogether
latent. His patient after a long illness died of diseased heart, the
ventricles of which communicated together. He never had a symptom
of disorder of the head; yet on dissection an extensive recent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_526'>526</span>softening was found in the right <i>corpus striatum</i> and another in the
right <i>thalamus</i>.<a id='r1668' /><a href='#f1668' class='c013'><sup>[1668]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>None of the treatises I have seen on the subject make mention of
a variety of this disease intermediate between suddenly fatal cases
and those which last several days,—a form in which the patient’s
illness endures for a few hours only, and which, both in the special
symptoms and in their course, imitates exactly the effects of some
narcotics. Two such cases have come under my notice, both of them
judicial, poisoning having been suspected. One of them proved fatal
in an hour and a half, the individual having previously been in excellent
health; and the only appearance of disease was softening of a
considerable part of the surface of the brain where it lies over the
left orbit. The other was more remarkable in its circumstances. In
November, 1822, a man, who had previously enjoyed excellent
health, was found one morning in a low lodging-house in the Lawnmarket
comatose, and convulsed; and he died seven hours afterwards.
The neighbours spread a report, that the woman of the house had
poisoned him, with the view of selling the body; and by an odd coincidence
the police, when they went to apprehend the woman, found
an anatomist hid in a closet. The body was judicially examined by
Sir W. Newbigging and myself; and we found an ulcer on the forepart
of the left hemisphere of the brain, and a small patch of softening
on each middle lobe.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is only in cases like the last two that the disease is likely to be
mistaken for the effects of poison; and the morbid appearances will
at once distinguish them. But it is requisite to remember that softening
of the brain when not far advanced is apt to escape notice, as it
is not necessarily attended with a change in the colour of the diseased
part. In the first of the two cases I have related, the cause of
death was very nearly assumed to have been simple apoplexy, when
at length the true disorder was unexpectedly noticed. I presume,
indeed, that strictly speaking, both of the cases which came under
my notice ought to be considered as simple apoplexy excited by pre-existing
<i>ramollissement</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of the Distinction between Hypertrophy of the Brain and Narcotic Poisoning.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>This disease is not here mentioned, because its symptoms and progress
resemble very closely those of poisoning with the narcotics;
for it causes epileptic symptoms, which, besides that they are preceded
for some time by other head affections, very seldom prove fatal in
less than three days. But some notice of it is necessary, because
the disease is rare and of recent discovery, so that the appearances
left by it in the dead body may escape observation. Besides, the
physician is at present imperfectly acquainted with it, and therefore,
when a more extensive collection of cases shall have been made, it
may be found to prove at times fatal so rapidly as to admit of being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_527'>527</span>confounded with narcotic poisoning. Hypertrophy of the brain, it is
true, is always a chronic or slow disease, but, like other diseases of
the brain, its early stages may possibly be so completely latent that
the patient may appear to die of a few hours’ illness. This, however,
must be left to the determination of future experience. The
most rapid case yet published proved fatal twenty-four hours after
the first appearance of symptoms.</p>

<p class='c006'>The appearances left in the body are increased density and firmness
of the whole brain or a part of it,—flattening of the convolutions
on their outer surface, so that their grooves are almost obliterated
and the investing membrane uncommonly dry,—unusual emptiness
of the blood-vessels of the brain and its membranes,—and a protrusion
of the brain upwards on removal of the skull-cap, as if the
organ were too large for its containing cavity.<a id='r1669' /><a href='#f1669' class='c013'><sup>[1669]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Some pathologists doubt the existence of hypertrophy of the brain
as a distinct disease, and conceive that the appearance of flattening
of the convolutions is produced by serum effused between the dura
mater and arachnoid membrane. But this explanation will not account
for those cases in which it is expressly stated that little or no
fluid was to be found in any part of the brain or in the base of the
skull.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of the Distinction between Diseases of the Spinal Cord and Narcotic Poisoning.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>It is not necessary to say much on the acute diseases of the spinal
cord, which are apt to be confounded with the effects of narcotic
poisons. The diseases are extravasation of blood into the spinal
canal, inflammation of the membranes, and inflammation [<i>ramollissement</i>]
of the cord itself. These disorders are commonly marked by
obvious and characteristic symptoms, as well as a much slower
course than that of the affections induced by narcotic poisons. But
occasionally they approach closely the characters of some of the slow
cases of narcotic poisoning,—palsy being absent, the leading symptoms
consisting of delirium, convulsions, and coma, and the fatal
event occurring within the third day. Dr. Abercrombie and M.
Ollivier have related examples of the kind arising from extravasation
of blood,<a id='r1670' /><a href='#f1670' class='c013'><sup>[1670]</sup></a> serous effusion,<a id='r1671' /><a href='#f1671' class='c013'><sup>[1671]</sup></a> and softening of the cord.<a id='r1672' /><a href='#f1672' class='c013'><sup>[1672]</sup></a> Such
cases are exceedingly rare; but the possibility of their occurrence
should impose on the medical jurist the necessity of examining the
spine with care in all judicial cases of alleged narcotic poisoning,
especially when death has not been rapid.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of the Distinction between syncopal Asphyxia, and Narcotic Poisons.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The only other natural disease requiring notice under the present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_528'>528</span>head is the <i>Asphyxia Idiopathica</i> of the late Mr. Chevallier. It may
be the cause of embarrassment in questions regarding narcotic poisoning,
when the course of the symptoms to their fatal termination is
rapid, and was not witnessed by any person; for it causes death with
equal rapidity, and its signs in the dead body are very obscure. It
has been observed chiefly among women in the latter months of pregnancy,
or soon after delivery; but it has also been known to attack
the male sex. It generally commences during a state of perfect health,
and is seldom preceded by any warning of danger. The person suddenly
complains of slight sickness, giddiness, and excessive faintness,
immediately seems to sleep or swoon away, and expires gently without
a struggle. The only appearance of note found in the dead body
is unusual flaccidity and emptiness of the heart.<a id='r1673' /><a href='#f1673' class='c013'><sup>[1673]</sup></a> But even these
slight appearances are not constant; for in a case related by Rochoux
of a woman who, while in a state of perfect health, suddenly grew
pale, slipped off her chair, and died on the spot, the auricles of the
heart contained a great deal of blood.<a id='r1674' /><a href='#f1674' class='c013'><sup>[1674]</sup></a> This singular disorder appears
to consist of nothing else than a mortal tendency to fainting;
and it may prove fatal either in the first fit of syncope, or after an hour
and a half.—Under the same head are probably to be arranged the
cases of sudden death described by M. Devergie under the title of
Death by Syncope. He has given scarcely any account of the circumstances
attending death; but it may be inferred from his classification
of the cases that fainting immediately preceded it. In all of them he
found blood in both sides of the heart; and the blood, contrary to
what happens in other kinds of sudden death, had separated into clear
serum, and fibrin free of colouring matter.<a id='r1675' /><a href='#f1675' class='c013'><sup>[1675]</sup></a>—Under the same head
also may be noticed a denomination of cases, which, though alluded
to before by various pathologists, were first distinctly characterized
by M. Ollivier, where death is caused on a sudden, apparently by
the disengagement of a large quantity of aëriform fluid from the blood
in the heart and great vessels. Among the instances described by
Ollivier, it appears that death repeatedly occurred quite suddenly
while the individuals enjoyed sound health; and the only appearances
of any note found in the body were tympanitic distension of the heart,
absence of blood there and in the great vessels, and the existence of
a gaseous fluid in numerous globules throughout the blood-vessels of
the brain. The circumstances of death and the appearances in the
dead body are much the same with those observed from the admission
of air into the veins during surgical operations. A case of this kind,
owing to its suddenness, might be confounded with the effects of the
more active narcotic poisons, such as hydrocyanic acid, especially as
its characters in the dead body might escape notice.<a id='r1676' /><a href='#f1676' class='c013'><sup>[1676]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Death often takes place from sudden syncope in <i>organic diseases of
the heart</i>. Such cases may be confounded with the most rapid variety
of poisoning with hydrocyanic acid; and if the duration of the symptoms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_529'>529</span>preceding death is unknown, they may give rise to a suspicion
of poisoning generally. But they are at once distinguished by the
morbid appearances. A trivial organic derangement may be the occasion
of instant death.</p>

<p class='c006'>The genera comprehended in the class of narcotics are opium,
henbane, lettuce-opium, solanum, hydrocyanic acid, and the deleterious
gases. Of these genera the last is by no means a pure one, for
it includes many gases which act as irritants only; but it is more convenient
to consider them together, than to distribute them into separate
classes. Some other vegetable substances besides henbane,
lettuce-opium, and solanum, possess nearly the same properties; but
as they likewise cause irritation, they are arranged more appropriately
in the next class, the narcotico-acrids.</p>

<p class='c006'>Most narcotic vegetables owe their poisonous properties to a peculiar
principle, probably of an alkaline nature, and slightly different in
each. This discovery was made with regard to opium in 1812; and
the discovery of the active principle in that drug has been followed
by the detection of analogous principles in most narcotics, as well as
in many narcotico-acrids.</p>

<p class='c006'>These principles are generally crystalline, soluble in alcohol and
the acids, little soluble in water, free from mineral admixture, and
entirely destructible by heat. When purified with the greatest care,
they still retain decided alkaline properties; but on account of their
number and the low power of neutralization their alkaline nature was
long denied; and they have been conventionally styled alkaloids.</p>

<p class='c006'>In their natural state they exist in combination with various ternary
acids, some of which are peculiar; and they are likewise intimately
blended, or more probably united chemically, with other
inert principles of the vegetable kingdom, particularly resinous and
extractive matters, to which they adhere with great obstinacy.</p>

<p class='c006'>They are all highly energetic, and generally concentrate in themselves
the leading properties of the substance from which they are
obtained.</p>

<p class='c006'>The experiments, which have led to the conclusion, that the narcotic
poisons act on the brain by entering the blood-vessels, have
been repeated with their alkaloids, and have yielded similar results.
But the alkaloids are in equal quantities much more energetic than
the crude poisons. Their effects indeed are truly formidable, and
some well authenticated instances of their action appear hardly less
marvellous than the most extravagant notions entertained in ancient
times of the operation of poisons. One of them, the principle of nux
vomica, which, however, does not belong to the present class, is so
active that in all probability a man might be killed with the third
part of a grain in less than fifteen minutes.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is very difficult to detect some of the vegetable alkaloids; and
it is fortunate, therefore, that they are rare, and not to be procured
but by complex processes.</p>

<p class='c006'>Chemical analysis does not by any means supply so good evidence
of poisoning with the narcotics as it does of poisoning with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_530'>530</span>irritants. Their chemical properties are not very characteristic, and
they are not well developed unless with a larger quantity of the
poison than will usually be met with in medico-legal investigations.
This remark, however, does not apply universally; and it is probable,
that, as organic analysis goes on improving, better and more delicate
processes will be discovered.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXVII.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING WITH OPIUM.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>To the medical jurist opium is one of the most important of
poisons; since there is hardly any other whose effects come more frequently
under his cognizance. It is the poison most generally resorted
to by the timid to accomplish self-destruction, for which
purpose it is peculiarly well adapted on account of the gentleness of
its operation. It has also been often the source of fatal accidents,
which naturally arise from its extensive employment in medicine. It
has likewise been long very improperly employed to create amusement.
And in recent times it has been made use of to commit murder,
and to induce stupor previous to the commission of robbery. Mr.
Burnett, in his work on Criminal Law, has mentioned a trial for
murder in 1800, in which the prisoners were accused of having committed
the crime by poisoning with opium; and although a verdict
of <i>not proven</i> was returned, there is little doubt that the deceased, an
adult, was poisoned in the way supposed. A few years ago, a remarkable
trial took place at Paris, where poisoning was alleged to
have been effected by means of the alkaloid principle of opium; and
the prisoner, a young physician of the name of Castaing, was condemned
and executed.</p>

<p class='c006'>In several parts of Britain during the last fifteen years many persons
have been brought into great danger by opium having been administered
as a narcotic to facilitate robbery; and some have actually
been killed. In December, 1828, a conviction was obtained in the
Judiciary Court of Edinburgh for this crime, in which instance the
persons who had taken the opium recovered. A fatal case, which
was strongly suspected to be of the same nature, was submitted to
me by the sheriff of this county in 1828; but sufficient evidence
could not be procured. In July, 1829, a man Stewart and his wife
were condemned, and subsequently executed for the same crime, the
person to whom they gave the opium having been killed by it.
And about a year afterwards a similar instance occurred at Glasgow,
for which a man Byers and his wife were condemned at the Autumn
Circuit of 1831.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> I.—<i>Of the Chemical History and Tests of Opium.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Opium is the inspissated juice of the capsules of the <i>Papaver somniferum</i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_531'>531</span>It has a reddish-brown colour, and a glimmering lustre on
a fresh surface. It is soft and plastic when recent; but if pure, may
be dried so as to become brittle. Its smell is strong and quite peculiar.
It has a very bitter and most peculiar taste. In consequence
of this taste one would suppose it no easy matter to administer opium
secretly. The plan resorted to by thieves and robbers seems to be,
to deaden the sense of taste by strong spirits, and then to ply the
person with porter or ale drugged with laudanum, or the black drop,
which possesses less odour.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following account of the chemical history of opium will be
confined in a great measure to the leading properties of the principles,
in which its active qualities are concentrated, or which are
likely by their chemical characters to supply proof of its presence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The common solvents act readily on opium. Water dissolves its
active principles even at low temperatures. So does alcohol. So
particularly do the mineral and vegetable acids when much diluted.
Ether removes from it little else than one of its active principles,
narcotine. By the action of these agents are procured various preparations
in common use. <i>Laudanum</i> is a spirituous infusion, and
contains the active ingredients of a twelfth part of its weight of opium.
<i>Scotch Paregoric Elixir</i>, a solution in ammoniated spirit, is only one-fifth
of the strength of laudanum; and <i>English Paregoric</i>, tincture of
opium and camphor for its chief ingredients, is four times weaker
still. <i>Wine of opium</i> contains the soluble part of a sixteenth of its
weight. The <i>black drop</i> and <i>Battley’s sedative liquor</i> are believed
to be solutions of opium in vegetable acids, and to possess, the former
four, the latter three times the strength of laudanum. But their
strength has been greatly exaggerated; neither of them, according to
my own experience, being above half what is supposed. The juice
and infusion of the garden poppy are also powerfully narcotic, so as
even to have caused death both when given by the mouth and in the
way of injection.<a id='r1677' /><a href='#f1677' class='c013'><sup>[1677]</sup></a> Many other pharmaceutic preparations contain
opium.</p>

<p class='c006'>If opium be infused in successive portions of cold water, the water
dissolves all its poisonous principles, and also a peculiar acid possessing
characteristic chemical properties. These principles are separated
by means of the alkalis, the alkaline carbonates, or the alkaline
earths. The most important of them are <i>morphia</i>, the chief alkaloid
of opium,—<i>narcotine</i>, a feeble poison, not an alkaloid,—a peculiar
acid, termed <i>meconic acid</i>,—and a <i>resinoid substance</i>. Other crystalline
principles also exist in opium, though apparently in too small
proportion either to affect its action or to be available in medico-legal
analysis as the means of detecting the drug. These are codeïa,
meconine, narceïne, paramorphia, and porphyroxine.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of the various principles now indicated it is necessary to notice
here only morphia, narcotine, codeïa, porphyroxine and meconic
acid. They require mention either as being active poisons, or because
a knowledge of their leading characters may be useful in conducting
a medico-legal analysis in a case of poisoning with opium.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_532'>532</span>Meconic acid, as procured by evaporation, is usually in little scales
of a pale brown or yellowish tint, being rendered so by adhering
resin or extractive matter; but when nearly colourless, it forms long,
extremely delicate tabular crystals, which in mass have a fine silky
appearance like spermaceti. 1. When heated in a tube, it is partly
decomposed, and partly sublimed; and the sublimate condenses in
filamentous, radiated crystals. 2. When dissolved even in a very
large quantity of water, the solution acquires an intense cherry-red
colour with the perchloride of iron. The sublimed crystals have the
same property. Only one other acid is so affected, namely, the sulpho-cyanic,
a very rare substance. It has been repeatedly stated,<a id='r1678' /><a href='#f1678' class='c013'><sup>[1678]</sup></a>
that the redness produced by meconic acid may be distinguished by
the effect of an alkali, which is said to bleach the colour produced
by sulpho-cyanic acid, but to deepen the cherry-red tint occasioned
by the meconic. This is not correct; an alkali added to the red solution
of meconate of iron precipitates oxide of iron and renders the
liquid colourless. The best distinction yet proposed is the following
which has been suggested by Dr. Percy. Acidulate the red fluid with
sulphuric acid, drop in a bit of pure zinc, and suspend at the mouth
of the tube a bit of paper moistened with solution of acetate of lead:
If the redness be caused by sulpho-cyanic acid, hydrosulphuric acid
gas is evolved, and blackens the paper; but no such effect ensues,
it the redness be owing to meconic acid.<a id='r1679' /><a href='#f1679' class='c013'><sup>[1679]</sup></a>—According to Dr. Pereira,
solutions of the acetates, an infusion of white mustard, decoctions
of Iceland moss, and of the <i>Gigantina helminthocorton</i>, besides
other more rare substances, are reddened, like solution of meconic
acid, by the salts of peroxide of iron.<a id='r1680' /><a href='#f1680' class='c013'><sup>[1680]</sup></a> 3. The solution of meconic
acid gives a pale-green precipitate with the sulphate of copper, and, if
the precipitate is not too abundant, it is dissolved by boiling, but reappears
on cooling.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of the Tests for Morphia and its Salts.</i>—Morphia, when pure, is
in small, beautiful, white crystals. Various forms have been ascribed
to it; but in the numerous crystallizations I have made, it has always
assumed when pure the form of a slightly flattened hexangular prism.
It has a bitter taste, but no smell.</p>

<p class='c006'>A gentle heat melts it, and if the fluid mass is then allowed to
cool, a crystalline radiated substance is formed. A stronger heat
reddens and then chars the fused mass, white fumes of a peculiar
odour are disengaged, and at last the mass kindles and burns brightly.—Morphia
is very little soluble in water. It is more soluble, yet
still sparingly so, in ether. But its proper solvents are alcohol, or
the diluted acids, mineral as well as vegetable. All its solutions are
intensely bitter, and that in alcohol has an alkaline reaction.—From
its solutions in the acids crystallizable salts may be procured; and
morphia may be separated by the superior affinity of any of the inorganic
alkalis; but it is easily redissolved by an excess of potash.—Morphia
when treated with nitric acid is dissolved with effervescence,
and becomes instantly orange-red, which, if too much acid be used,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_533'>533</span>changes quickly to yellow. The coloration of morphia by nitric acid is
a characteristic property; which, however, it possesses in common with
some other alkaloids, such as brucia, and also strychnia when not
quite pure. The change of colour is said by some chemists to depend
on adhering resinoid matter, and not to be possessed by perfectly
pure morphia; but this is a mistake. It is probable that some other
vegetable substances besides the three alkaloids, morphia, brucia,
and strychnia, may be turned orange-red by nitric acid. Dr. Pereira
says that oil of pimento undergoes the same change.<a id='r1681' /><a href='#f1681' class='c013'><sup>[1681]</sup></a>—When
suspended in water, in the form of fine powder and then treated with
a drop or two of perchloride of iron containing little or no free hydrochloric
acid, it is dissolved and forms a deep blue solution, the
tint of which is more purely blue, the stronger the solution, and the
purer the morphia. This is a property even more characteristic than the
former, since no such effect is produced on any other known alkaloid.
Like the effect of nitric acid, it is said not to be essential to morphia,
but to depend on adhering resinoid matter; yet the blue colour is
always strongly produced with powdered morphia of snowy-whiteness.—Another
property by which morphia maybe also distinguished
is the decomposition of iodic acid. A solution of iodic acid is turned
brown either by morphia or its salts, owing to the formation of iodine;
and the test is so delicate that it affects a solution containing a 7000th
of morphia.<a id='r1682' /><a href='#f1682' class='c013'><sup>[1682]</sup></a> So many other substances, however, possess the property
of disengaging iodine from iodic acid, that little importance
can be attached to this criterion.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Acetate of Morphia</i> is in some countries the common medicinal
form for administering morphia; but it has been almost entirely superseded
in this city by the hydrochlorate, since Dr. W. Gregory
pointed out a cheap mode of procuring that salt in a state of purity.<a id='r1683' /><a href='#f1683' class='c013'><sup>[1683]</sup></a>
The acetate is in confused crystals, often of a brownish colour from
impurities. The stronger acids disengage acetic acid. The alkalis
throw down morphia from its solution in water. Nitric acid and
perchloride of iron act on it as on morphia itself.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Hydrochlorate of Morphia.</i>—The muriate or hydrochlorate must be
carefully attended to by the medical jurist, because it is extensively
used in medical practice instead of opium. As now prepared, it is
snowy-white and apparently pulverulent, but is in reality a congeries
of filiform crystals. It decrepitates slightly when heated, then melts,
and at the same time chars, exhaling a strong odour somewhat like
that of truffles. Nitric acid and perchloride of iron act on it as on
morphia. Boiling water dissolves fully its own weight, and very
easily three-fourths of its weight of hydrochlorate of morphia; and
on cooling down to 60° F. it retains seven parts per cent., and deposits
the rest in tufts of beautiful filiform crystals. The solution
commonly employed in medicine contains one per cent. of the salt.
Nitric acid turns the solution yellow, acting distinctly enough when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_534'>534</span>the water contains a hundredth, and perceptibly when it contains
only a two-hundredth of its weight. Perchloride of iron strikes a deep
blue with a solution containing a hundredth of its weight, very distinctly
when the proportion is a two-hundredth, and even perceptibly
when it is only a five-hundredth. A solution much more diluted
than even the last has a strong bitter taste. When moderately concentrated,
morphia is precipitated from it by the alkalis.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of the preceding properties of morphia and its salts, those which
constitute the most characteristic tests are the effects of perchloride
of iron and of nitric acid on all of them, the effect of heat on
morphia, and the effect of an alkali on its solutions in acids.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of the Tests for Narcotine.</i>—Narcotine is rather distinguished by
negative than by positive chemical properties. When pure, it is in
transparent colourless pearly crystals, which, as formed from alcohol,
may be either very flat, oblique, six-sided prisms, or oblong four-sided
tables obliquely bevelled on their sides. But when crystallized
from sulphuric ether the crystals are prisms with a rhombic base. They
fuse with heat, and concrete on cooling into a resinous-like mass.
They are soluble in ether, and fixed oil, less so in alcohol, insoluble
in water or the alkalis, very soluble in the diluted acids, but without
effecting neutralization; and if perfectly pure, they do not undergo
the changes produced on morphia by perchloride of iron or nitric
acid. Few specimens of narcotic, however, are so pure as not to
render nitric acid yellow. Care must be taken not to confound narcotine
with morphia. When crystallized together from alcohol and
not quite pure, narcotine forms tufts of pearly thin tabular crystals,
while morphia is in short, thick, sparkling prisms.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of Codeïa.</i>—This substance is, like morphia, an alkaloid, capable
of combining with acids. It differs from morphia and narcotine in
being moderately soluble in water; and from this solution it may be
crystallized in large crystals affecting the octaedral form. It is unnecessary
to detail its chemical properties.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of the Tests for Porphyroxine.</i>—This principle is a neutral crystalline
body, insoluble in water, soluble in alcohol and ether, and
also soluble in weak acids, which part with it unchanged on the addition
of an alkali. When heated with hydrochloric acid, a fine purple
or rose-red solution is produced; whence its name. It is supposed
that this property may be of use in medico-legal researches; and
the following mode of developing it has been proposed by Dr.
Merck, its discoverer.<a id='r1684' /><a href='#f1684' class='c013'><sup>[1684]</sup></a> Decompose the suspected fluid with caustic
potash; agitate the mixture with sulphuric ether; dip a bit of white
filtering paper repeatedly in the etherial solution, drying it after each
immersion; then wet the paper with hydrochloric acid, and expose
it to the vapour of boiling water; upon which the paper will become
more or less acid.</p>

<h5 class='c011'><i>Of the Process for detecting Opium in mixed fluids and solids.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>Having stated these particulars of the chemical history of opium
<span class='pageno' id='Page_535'>535</span>and its chief component ingredients, I shall now describe what has
appeared to me the most delicate and satisfactory method of detecting
it in a mixed state.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. If there be any solid matter, it is to be cut into small fragments,
water is to be added if necessary, then a little acetic acid sufficient to
render the mixture acidulous, and when the whole mass has been
well stirred, and has stood a few minutes, it is to be filtered, and
evaporated at a temperature somewhat below ebullition to the consistence
of a moderately thick syrup. To this extract strong alcohol
is to be gradually added, care being taken to break down any coagulum
which may be formed: and after ebullition and cooling, the
alcoholic solution is to be filtered. The solution must then be evaporated
to the consistence of a thin syrup, and the residue dissolved in
distilled water and filtered anew.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Add now the solution of acetate of lead as long as it causes precipitation,
filter and wash. The filtered fluid contains acetate of
morphia, and the precipitate on the filter contains meconic acid
united with the oxide of lead.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The fluid part is to be treated with hydrosulphuric acid gas, to
throw down any lead which may remain in solution. It is then to
be filtered while <i>cold</i>, and evaporated sufficiently in a vapour-bath.
The solution in this state will sometimes be sufficiently pure for the
application of the tests for morphia; but in most cases it is necessary,
and in all advisable, to purify it still farther. For this purpose the
morphia is to be precipitated with carbonate of soda; and the precipitate
having been collected, washed, and drained on a filter, the
precipitate and portion of the filter to which it adheres are to be
boiled in a little pure alcohol. The alcoholic solution,—filtered, if
necessary,—will give by evaporation a crystalline residue of morphia,
which becomes orange-red with nitric acid, and blue with perchloride
of iron. The latter property I have sometimes been unable
to develope when the former was presented characteristically.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. It is useful, however, to separate the meconic acid also; because,
as its properties are more delicate, I have repeatedly been able
to detect it satisfactorily, when I did not feel satisfied with the result
of the search for morphia. Dr. Ure made the same remark in his
evidence on the trial of Stewart and his wife. He detected the meconic
acid, but could not separate the morphia. It may be detected
in one of two ways,—by means of hydrosulphuric acid, or by sulphuric
acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the former method be chosen, suspend in a little water the precipitate
caused by the acetate of lead (par. 2); transmit hydrosulphuric
acid gas till the whole precipitate is blackened; filter immediately
without boiling; then boil, and if necessary filter a second
time. A great part of the impurities thrown down by the acetate of
lead will be separated with the sulphuret of lead; and the meconic
acid is dissolved. But it requires in general farther purification,
which is best attained by again throwing it down with acetate of
lead, and repeating the steps of the present paragraph. The fluid is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_536'>536</span>now to be concentrated by evaporation at a temperature not exceeding
180° F., and subjected to the tests for meconic acid, more particularly
to the action of perchloride of iron, when the quantity is
small. If there is evidently a considerable quantity of acid, a portion
should be evaporated till it yields crystalline scales; and these
are to be heated in a tube to procure the arborescent crystalline sublimate
formerly described. About a sixth of a grain of meconic acid,
however, is required to try the latter test conveniently.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the method of separating meconic acid by means of sulphuric
acid be preferred, the precipitate formed by acetate of lead is to be
treated with weak sulphuric acid, which forms insoluble sulphate of
lead, and disengages the meconic acid. The liquid obtained by
filtration is then to be evaporated as above, to obtain crystals, which
are to be examined by the tests for meconic acid. Orfila thinks
this method more delicate than the mode by hydrosulphuric acid gas.
I am inclined from my own experiments to doubt his statement.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. If there be a sufficiency of the original material, Merck’s process
for detecting porphyroxin may be tried [see p. <a href='#Page_534'>534</a>]. But I doubt
whether this process is sufficiently delicate for medico-legal purposes.</p>

<p class='c006'>I wish I could add my testimony to the opinion, expressed on a
remarkable occasion by Professor Chaussier, in favour of the delicacy
of the tests for morphia and its compounds, that they might be detected
“jusqu’à une molécule.”<a id='r1685' /><a href='#f1685' class='c013'><sup>[1685]</sup></a> In one sense this statement may
be correct. Morphia, separated from the complex mixture of principles
with which it is combined in opium, may be detected in extremely
small quantities. Accordingly, M. Lassaigne has supplied,
for the discovery of acetate of morphia in mixed fluids, an excellent
process, whence the chief part of the three first paragraphs of the
preceding method for opium are borrowed; and from the facts stated
by him in his paper,<a id='r1686' /><a href='#f1686' class='c013'><sup>[1686]</sup></a> as well as from the experimental testimony of
Professor Orfila,<a id='r1687' /><a href='#f1687' class='c013'><sup>[1687]</sup></a> it appears that Lassaigne’s process will furnish
strong indications, if not absolute proof of the presence of that salt,
in the proportion of two grains to eight ounces of the most complex
mixtures. Hence the search for acetate of morphia in a suspected
case is by no means hopeless. But the detection of acetate of morphia
is an object of small moment, compared with the detection of
morphia in its natural state of combination in opium. Now my own
observations lead me to entertain serious doubts, whether the best
method of operating hitherto known could be successfully applied to
the detection of the equivalent opium in complex mixtures. By the
process I have recommended it is easy to procure, from an infusion
of ten grains of opium in four ounces of water, satisfactory proof of
the presence of morphia by the action of ammonia, perchloride of
iron and nitric acid, and equally distinct proof of the presence of
meconic acid by perchloride of iron, as well as sulphate of copper.
But on proceeding to apply the process to organic mixtures, I have
found that when the soluble part of ten grains of opium was mixed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_537'>537</span>with four ounces of porter or milk, I could develope no property of
morphia but its bitterness, and no indication of meconic acid but the
action of perchloride of iron. MM. Larocque and Thibierge, it is
right to add, have in similar circumstances found the process somewhat
more delicate.<a id='r1688' /><a href='#f1688' class='c013'><sup>[1688]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It is of great consequence, however, to remark, that in cases of
poisoning with opium, the medical jurist will seldom have the good
fortune to operate even upon so large a proportion of the poison as
in my experiments; because the greater part of it disappears from
the stomach before death. This will not happen always, as may be
seen from various cases mentioned afterwards in the section on the
morbid appearances caused by opium. But, according to my own
observations, the poison will often disappear in a short time, so far as
to render an analysis abortive. Thus in the case of a young woman
who died five hours after taking not less than two ounces of laudanum,
I could apply to the fluid, procured from the contents of the
stomach, by paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of my process, only the test of
its taste, which had the bitterness of morphia. In the case of another
young woman, whose stomach was emptied by the stomach-pump
four hours after she took two ounces of laudanum, I could obtain
from the evacuated fluid, when properly prepared, only the indications
of the presence of morphia supplied by its bitterness and the
imperfect action of nitric acid,—and the indication of the presence
of meconic acid supplied by the imperfect action of perchloride of
iron. In a third case, where the stomach was evacuated two hours
after seven drachms of laudanum had been swallowed, even the first
portions of fluid withdrawn had not any opiate odour, and did not
yield any indication of the presence even of meconic acid. Now,
on the one hand, the quantity taken in these instances is rarely exceeded
in cases of poisoning with laudanum; and, on the other hand,
the interval during which it remained in the stomach subject to vital
operations is considerably less than the average in medico-legal, and
above all in fatal cases. It may be laid down, therefore, as a general
rule, that in poisoning with opium the medical jurist, by the best
methods of analysis yet known, will often fail in procuring satisfactory
evidence, and sometimes fail to obtain any evidence at all, of
the existence of the poison in the contents of the stomach. In a case
published by Dr. Bright from the experience of Mr. Walne of London,
it is stated that the matter removed from the stomach only half
an hour after an ounce and a half of laudanum had been taken, while
the stomach was empty, did not smell of opium.<a id='r1689' /><a href='#f1689' class='c013'><sup>[1689]</sup></a> This case is
quoted to put the reader on his guard. But at the same time it does
appear extremely improbable that the whole opium had disappeared
from the stomach in so short a time, and much more likely that it
might have been found by analysis in the matter first withdrawn.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have taken some pains to establish the proposition laid down
above, because in a matter of such importance it is always essential,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_538'>538</span>that the medical inspector know the real extent of his resources;
and it has appeared to me that, greatly as the hand of the chemist
has been strengthened by late discoveries in vegetable analysis, his
power has been overrated both by his scientific brethren, and by the
medical profession generally. I am happy to find, since the first
publication of these remarks, that they coincide with the experience
and opinion of so eminent an authority as Professor Buchner; who
has observed that a chemical analysis must often fail to detect opium
where there could be no doubt of its having been administered in
large quantity.<a id='r1690' /><a href='#f1690' class='c013'><sup>[1690]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It is of moment to add, that in two of the instances mentioned
above the odour of laudanum was perceived in the subject of
analysis,—faintly, however, and only for a few hours after it was
removed from the stomach. Although the peculiar odour of opium
is a delicate criterion of its presence, it does not follow that it should
be preferred to an elaborate chemical analysis. For it is a test of
extreme uncertainty. There is in the contents of the stomach such
a complication of odours, that with a rather delicate sense of smell,
I have sometimes been unable to satisfy myself of the presence of the
opiate odour where others were sure it existed. At the same time
the medical jurist should not neglect it as a subsidiary test. It is
always strongest and most characteristic, first, when the stomach is
just opened, or the contents just withdrawn, and again, when the
fluid, in the course of preparation, as directed in paragraph 1 (p. <a href='#Page_535'>535</a>),
is just reaching the point of ebullition. The latter odour is somewhat
different from the former, yet quite peculiar, and such as every
chemist must have remarked on boiling an infusion of opium. It is
further to be observed, that although the odour of opium is a very
delicate test of its presence even in complex organic mixtures, chemical
analysis may be successful, where this character fails. Dr.
Morehead of the Bombay service, in applying my process to the fluid
withdrawn by the stomach-pump, detected morphia both by nitric
acid and perchloride of iron, although he could not detect any odour
of opium in the fluid.<a id='r1691' /><a href='#f1691' class='c013'><sup>[1691]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>So much for the delicacy of the process. As to its precision,—from
what I have myself witnessed, as well as from the experience
of Dr. Ure, it will often happen in actual practice, that the only indication
of opium to be procured by the process consists in the deep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_539'>539</span>red colour struck by perchloride of iron with the meconic acid.
Now, will this alone constitute sufficient proof of the presence of
opium? On the whole, I am inclined to reply in the affirmative.
Sulpho-cyanic acid, it is true, has the same effect, and this acid has
been proved by Professors Gmelin and Tiedemann to exist in the
human saliva,<a id='r1692' /><a href='#f1692' class='c013'><sup>[1692]</sup></a>—a fact which was called in question by Dr. Ure in
his evidence on the trial of the Stuarts, but which at the time I had
verified, and which Dr. Ure has since been compelled by experiments
of his own to admit.<a id='r1693' /><a href='#f1693' class='c013'><sup>[1693]</sup></a> But it must be very seldom possible
to procure a distinct blood-red coloration from the saliva, after it has
been mixed with the complex contents of the stomach, and subjected
to the process of analysis detailed above;<a id='r1694' /><a href='#f1694' class='c013'><sup>[1694]</sup></a> and the check proposed
by Dr. Percy (p. <a href='#Page_532'>532</a>) will distinguish it.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> II.—<i>Of the Action of Opium, and the Symptoms it excites in Man.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The symptoms and mode of action of opium have been long
made the subject of dispute, both among physicians and toxicologists;
and in some particulars our knowledge is still vague and insufficient.</p>

<p class='c006'>Under the head of general poisoning, some experiments were related,
from which it might be inferred that opium has the power of
stupefying or suspending the irritability of the parts to which it is
immediately applied. The most unequivocal of these facts, which
occurred to Dr. Wilson Philip, was instant paralysis of the intestines
of a dog, when an infusion of opium was applied to their mucous
coat;<a id='r1695' /><a href='#f1695' class='c013'><sup>[1695]</sup></a> another hardly less decisive was palsy of the hind-legs of a
frog, observed by Dr. Monro Secundus, when opium was injected
between the skin and the muscles;<a id='r1696' /><a href='#f1696' class='c013'><sup>[1696]</sup></a> and a third, which has been remarked
by several experimentalists, is immediate cessation of the
contractions of the frog’s heart when opium is applied to its inner
surface.<a id='r1697' /><a href='#f1697' class='c013'><sup>[1697]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The poison has also powerful constitutional or remote effects,
which are chiefly produced on the brain. Much discussion has arisen
on the question, whether these constitutional effects are owing to the
conveyance of the local torpor along the nerves to the brain, or to
the poison being absorbed, and so acting on the brain through the
blood. The question is not yet settled. It appears pretty certain,
however, that the poison cannot act constitutionally without entering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_540'>540</span>the blood-vessels; although it is not so clear, that after it has entered
them, it acts by being carried with the blood to the brain. The
newest doctrine supposes that it enters the blood-vessels, and produces
on their inner coat an impression which is conveyed along the
nerves.</p>

<p class='c006'>According to the experiments of Professor Orfila, it is more energetic
when applied to the surface of a wound than when introduced
into the stomach, and most energetic of all when injected into a vein.<a id='r1698' /><a href='#f1698' class='c013'><sup>[1698]</sup></a>
The inference generally drawn from these and other analogous experiments<a id='r1699' /><a href='#f1699' class='c013'><sup>[1699]</sup></a>
is, that the blood transmits the poison in substance to the
brain. They certainly, however, do not prove more than that the
poison must enter the blood before it acts.</p>

<p class='c006'>The old doctrine, that the blood-vessels have no concern with its
action, and that it acts only by conveyance along the nerves of a peculiar
local torpor arising from its direct application to their sentient
extremities, has been long abandoned by most physiologists as untenable.
But some have adopted a late modification of this doctrine,
by supposing that opium may act both by being carried with the
blood to the brain, and by the transmission of local torpor along the
nerves. They believe, in fact, that opium possesses a double mode
of action,—through sympathy as well as through absorption. It
would be fruitless to inquire into the grounds that exist for adopting
or rejecting this doctrine, because sufficient facts are still wanting to
decide the controversy. So far as they go, however, they appear
adverse to the supposition of a conveyance of impressions along the
nerves, without the previous entrance of the poison within the blood-vessels.
The difficulties, in the way of the theory of the sympathetic
action of opium, would be removed by the doctrine of Messrs.
Morgan and Addison. According to their views, the experiments,
which appear at first sight to prove that this substance operates by
being carried with the blood to the part on which it acts, are easily
explained by considering that the opium makes a peculiar impression
on the inside of the vessels, which impression subsequently
passes along the nerves to the brain.<a id='r1700' /><a href='#f1700' class='c013'><sup>[1700]</sup></a> But, as stated in the introductory
chapter on the physiology of poisoning, this theory requires
support.</p>

<p class='c006'>The effects of opium, through whatever channel it may produce
them, are exerted chiefly on the brain and nervous system. This
appears from the experiments of a crowd of physiologists, as well as
from the symptoms observed a thousand times in man. In animals
the symptoms are different from those remarked in man. Some experimentalists
have indeed witnessed in the higher orders of animals,
as in the human subject, pure lethargy and coma. But the latest researches,
among the rest those of M. Orfila, show that much more
generally it causes in animals hurried pulse, giddiness, palsy of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_541'>541</span>hind-legs, convulsions of various degrees of intensity, from simple
tremors to violent tetanus, and a peculiar slumber, in the midst of
which a slight excitement rouses the animal and renews the convulsions.
These symptoms are produced in whatever way the poison
enters the body, whether by the stomach, or by a wound, or by direct
injection into a vein, or by the rectum. In man, convulsions are
sometimes excited; but much more commonly simple sopor and
coma.</p>

<p class='c006'>According to the inquiries of M. Charret, which were extended to
every class of the lower animals, opium produces three leading effects.
It acts on the brain, causing congestion, and consequently
sopor; on the general nervous centre as an irritant, exciting convulsions;
and on the muscles as a direct sedative. It is poisonous to
all animals,—man, carnivorous quadrupeds, the <i>rodentia</i>, birds, reptiles,
amphibious animals, fishes, insects, and the <i>mollusca</i>. But of
its three leading effects some are not produced in certain classes or
orders of animals. In the <i>mammalia</i>, with the exception of man,
there is no cerebral congestion induced, and death takes place amidst
convulsions. In birds there is some cerebral congestion towards
the close; but still the two other phenomena are the most prominent.<a id='r1701' /><a href='#f1701' class='c013'><sup>[1701]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It has been rendered probable, by what is stated above, that opium
enters the blood. The question, therefore, naturally arises, whether
its presence there can be proved by chemical analysis? But considering
the imperfection of the processes for detecting it when mixed
with organic substances, no disappointment ought to be felt if this
proof should fail in regard to so complex a fluid as the blood. The
only person who has represented himself successful in the search is
M. Barruel of Paris. He examined the urine and blood of a man
under the influence of a poisonous dose of laudanum, amounting to
an ounce and a half; and procured indications of morphia in both.
When three ounces of urine were boiled with magnesia, and the insoluble
matter was collected, washed, dried, and boiled, in alcohol, the
residue of the alcoholic solution formed a white stain, which became
deep orange-red on the addition of nitric acid. The blood
was subjected to a more complex operation. One pound and ten
ounces of it were bruised in a mortar, diluted with two pounds of
water, strongly acidulated with sulphuric acid, boiled, filtered, and
washed. The filtered fluid was saturated with chalk, and the excess
of carbonic acid driven off by heat. The fluid was then filtered
again, and after being washed with water, was acted on by diluted
acetic acid. The acetic solution left on evaporation a residue which
was repeatedly acted on by alcohol; and the residue of the alcoholic
solutions was treated with pure alcohol and carbonate of lime.
The new solution when filtered and evaporated left several small
white stains, which became orange-red with nitric acid.<a id='r1702' /><a href='#f1702' class='c013'><sup>[1702]</sup></a> These results
have been since contradicted by M. Dublanc. He in vain
sought for morphia in the blood and urine of people who were taking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_542'>542</span>acetate medicinally, or of animals that were killed by it.<a id='r1703' /><a href='#f1703' class='c013'><sup>[1703]</sup></a> Barruel’s
results are also at variance with some pointed experiments of M.
Lassaigne, who could not detect any acetate of morphia even in
blood drawn from a dog twelve hours after thirty-six grains were injected
into the crural vein;<a id='r1704' /><a href='#f1704' class='c013'><sup>[1704]</sup></a> nor any in the liver or venous blood of
a dog poisoned with eight ounces of Sydenham’s laudanum.<a id='r1705' /><a href='#f1705' class='c013'><sup>[1705]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In investigating the effects of opium and its principles on man, the
natural order of procedure is to consider in the first place those of
opium itself in its various forms.</p>

<p class='c006'>The effect of a small dose seems to be generally in the first instance
stimulating: the action of the heart and arteries is increased, and a
slight sense of fulness is caused in the head. This stimulus differs
much in different individuals. In most persons it is quite insignificant.
In its highest degree it is well exemplified by Dr. Leigh in his Experimental
Inquiry, as they occurred to a friend of his who repeatedly
made the experiment. If in the evening when he felt sleepy, he took
thirty drops of laudanum, he was enlivened so that he could resume
his studies; and if, when the usual drowsiness approached, which it
did in two hours, he took a hundred drops more, he soon became so
much exhilarated, that he was compelled to laugh and sing and dance.
The pulse meanwhile was full and strong, and the temporal arteries
throbbed forcibly. In no long time the customary torpor ensued.
The stimulant effect of opium given during a state of exhaustion is
also well illustrated by Dr. Burnes in his account of Cutch. “On
one occasion,” says he, “I had made a very fatiguing night march
with a Cutchee horseman. In the morning, after having travelled
above thirty miles, I was obliged to assent to his proposal of haulting
for a few minutes, which he employed in sharing a quantity of about
two drachms of opium between himself and his jaded horse. The
effect of the dose was soon evident on both, for the horse finished a journey
of forty miles with great apparent facility, and the rider absolutely
became more active and intelligent.”<a id='r1706' /><a href='#f1706' class='c013'><sup>[1706]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>By repeating small doses frequently, the stimulus may be kept up
for a considerable time in some people. In this way are produced
the remarkable effects said to be experienced by opium-eaters in the
east. These effects seem to be in the first instance stimulant, the
imagination being rendered brilliant, the passions exalted, and the
muscular force increased; and this state endures for a considerable
time before the usual stage of collapse supervenes. A very poetical,
but I believe also a faithful, picture of the phenomena now alluded
to is given in the Confessions of an English Opium-eater,—a work
well known to be founded on the personal experience of the writer.
It is singular that our profession should have observed these phenomena
so little, as to be accused by him of having wholly misrepresented
the action of the most common drug in medical practice. In reply
to this charge the physician may simply observe, that he seldom administers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_543'>543</span>opium in the way practised by the opium-eater; that when
given in the usual therapeutic mode it rarely causes material excitement;
that some professional people prefer giving it in frequent
small doses, with the view of procuring its sedative effect, and undoubtedly
do succeed in attaining their object; that in both of these
medicinal ways of administering it, excitement is occasionally produced
to a great degree and of a disagreeable kind; that the latter
phenomena have been clearly traced to idiosyncrasy; and therefore
that the effects on opium-eaters are probably owing either to the same
cause, or to the modifying power of habit. This much at all events
is certain,—that in persons unaccustomed to opium it seldom produces
material excitement in a single small dose, and does not always cause
continuous excitement when taken after the manner of the opium-eater.
The effect of a full medicinal dose of two or three grains of
solid opium, or forty or sixty grains of the tincture, is to produce in
general a transient excitement and fulness of the pulse, but in a short
time afterwards torpor and sleep, commonly succeeded in six, eight,
or ten hours by headache, nausea, and dry tongue.</p>

<p class='c006'>The symptoms of poisoning with opium, administered at once in a
dangerous dose, begin with giddiness and stupor, generally without
any previous stimulus. The stupor rapidly increasing, the person
soon becomes motionless and insensible to external impressions; he
breathes slowly; generally lies still, with the eyes shut and the pupils
contracted; and the whole expression of the countenance is that of
deep and perfect repose. As the poisoning advances, the features
become ghastly, the pulse feeble and imperceptible, the muscles excessively
relaxed, and, unless assistance speedily arrive, death ensues.
If recovery take place, the sopor is succeeded by prolonged
sleep, which commonly ends in twenty-four or thirty-six hours, and
is followed by nausea, vomiting, giddiness, and loathing of food.</p>

<p class='c006'>The period which elapses between the taking of the poison and
the commencement of the symptoms is various. A large quantity,
taken in the form of tincture, on an empty stomach, may begin to act
in a few minutes; but for obvious reasons it is not easy to learn the
precise fact as to this particular. Dr. Meyer, late medical inspector
at Berlin, has related a case of poisoning with six ounces of the saffron
tincture of opium, where the person was found in a hopeless state of
coma in half an hour,<a id='r1707' /><a href='#f1707' class='c013'><sup>[1707]</sup></a> and M. Ollivier has described another instance
of a man who was found completely soporose at the same distance
of time after taking an ounce and a half of laudanum.<a id='r1708' /><a href='#f1708' class='c013'><sup>[1708]</sup></a> In
these cases, the symptoms must have begun in ten or fifteen minutes
at farthest. In a case noticed by M. Desruelles the sopor was fairly
formed in fifteen minutes after two drachms of solid opium were
taken.<a id='r1709' /><a href='#f1709' class='c013'><sup>[1709]</sup></a> For the most part, however, opium, taken in the solid form,
does not begin to act for half an hour or even almost a whole hour,—that
period being required to allow its poisonous principles to be
separated and absorbed by the bibulous vessels. It is singular that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_544'>544</span>an interval of an hour was remarked in a case where the largest
quantity was taken which has yet been recorded. The patient swallowed
eight ounces of crude opium; but in an hour her physician found
her able to tell connectedly all she had done; and she recovered.<a id='r1710' /><a href='#f1710' class='c013'><sup>[1710]</sup></a> In
some rare cases the sopor is put off for a longer period: thus, in a
case mentioned in Corvisart’s Journal, there seems to have been no
material stupor till considerably more than an hour after the person
took two ounces and a half of the tincture with a drachm of the
extract.<a id='r1711' /><a href='#f1711' class='c013'><sup>[1711]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The result of almost universal observation, however, is, that in
pure poisoning with opium the commencement of the symptoms is
not put off much beyond an hour. Such being the fact, it is extremely
difficult to account for the following extraordinary case,
which was communicated to me by Dr. Heude, of the East India
Company’s service. A man swallowed an ounce and a half of laudanum,
and in an hour half as much more, and then lay down in bed.
Some excitement followed, and also numbness of the arms and legs.
But he continued so sensible and lively seven hours after the first
dose was taken, that a medical gentleman, who saw him at that time
and got from him a confession of what he had done, very naturally
did not believe his story. It was not till at least the eighteenth hour
that stupor set in; but two hours later, when Dr. Heude first saw him,
he laboured under all the characteristic symptoms of poisoning with
opium in an aggravated degree. The stomach-pump brought away a
fluid quite free of the odour of opium. In seven hours more, under
assiduous treatment, after having been in an almost hopeless state of
insensibility, he had recovered so far as to be safely left in charge of
a friend; and eventually he got quite well. No particular cause
could be discovered for the long apparent suspension of the usual
effects of opium.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although the symptoms are very rarely postponed beyond an hour
in pure poisoning with this substance, there is some reason for thinking
that the interval may be much longer, if at the time of taking
the opium the person be excited by intoxication from previously
drinking spirits. Mr. Shearmen has related a striking case of an
habitual drunkard, who took two ounces of laudanum while intoxicated
to excitement with beer and spirits, and had no material
stupor for five hours, during which period vomiting could not be induced.
Five hours afterwards, he was found insensible, and he eventually
died under symptoms of poisoning with opium.<a id='r1712' /><a href='#f1712' class='c013'><sup>[1712]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The most remarkable symptom in the generality of cases of poisoning
with opium is the peculiar sopor. This state differs from coma,
in as much as the patient continues long capable of being roused.
It may be difficult to rouse him; but unless death is at hand, this
may be commonly accomplished by brisk agitation, tickling the nostrils,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_545'>545</span>loud speaking, or the injection of water into the ear. The
state of restored consciousness is always imperfect, and is speedily
followed again by lethargy when the exciting power is withheld.—It
has been already remarked, that the possibility of thus interrupting
the lethargy caused by opium is in general a good criterion for
distinguishing the effects of this poison from apoplexy and epilepsy.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was observed, in describing the mode of action of opium, that
convulsions, although very frequently produced by it in animals, are
rarely caused in man. It is not easy to account for this difference.
Orfila has endeavoured to explain it, by supposing that convulsions
are produced only by very large doses; but there are many facts
incompatible with that supposition.</p>

<p class='c006'>While convulsions are certainly not common in the human subject,
yet when they do occur they are sometimes violent. Tralles mentions
that he had himself several times seen convulsions excited in
children by moderate doses.<a id='r1713' /><a href='#f1713' class='c013'><sup>[1713]</sup></a> The Journal Universel contains the
case of a soldier who took two drachms of solid opium, and died in
six hours and a half, after being affected with locked-jaw and dreadful
spasms.<a id='r1714' /><a href='#f1714' class='c013'><sup>[1714]</sup></a> A case is related in the Medical and Physical Journal
of a young man, who, three hours after swallowing an ounce of
laudanum, was found insensible, with the mouth distorted, the jaws
fixed, and the hands clenched; and who, soon after the insensibility
was lessened by proper remedies, was seized with spasms of the
back, neck, and extremities, so violent as to resemble opisthotonos.<a id='r1715' /><a href='#f1715' class='c013'><sup>[1715]</sup></a>
Another good case of the kind is related by Mr. M’Kechnie, where
the voluntary muscles were violently convulsed in frequent paroxysms,
and affected in the intervals with subsultus, for three hours before the
sopor came on.<a id='r1716' /><a href='#f1716' class='c013'><sup>[1716]</sup></a> Two instances of convulsions alternating with
sopor are shortly related by Dr. Bright.<a id='r1717' /><a href='#f1717' class='c013'><sup>[1717]</sup></a> The convulsions sometimes
assume the form of permanent spasm, which may affect the whole
muscles of the body, as in a case related in Corvisart’s Journal.<a id='r1718' /><a href='#f1718' class='c013'><sup>[1718]</sup></a>—Another
rare symptom of poisoning with opium is delirium. It appears
to occur occasionally along with convulsions, as happened in
Mr. M’Kechnie’s case, and in one related by M. Ollivier.<a id='r1719' /><a href='#f1719' class='c013'><sup>[1719]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The state of the pulse varies considerably. In an interesting case
described by Dr. Marcet it is mentioned that the pulse was 90, feeble
and irregular; and such appears to be its most common condition
when the dose has been so large as seriously to endanger life.<a id='r1720' /><a href='#f1720' class='c013'><sup>[1720]</sup></a> Frequently,
however, it is much slower; and then it is rather full than
feeble, just as in apoplexy. In cases where convulsions occur, it is for
the most part hurried, and does not become slow till the coma becomes
pure. In Mr. M’Kechnie’s case the pulse was at first 126; but when
the convulsions ceased, and pure sopor supervened, it fell to 55. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_546'>546</span>always becomes towards the close very feeble, and at length imperceptible.</p>

<p class='c006'>The respiration is almost always slow. In Dr. Marcet’s case, as in
some others, it was stertorous; but this is not common. On the
contrary, it is more frequently soft and gentle, as it has been in all
the cases I have witnessed; and sometimes it can hardly be perceived
at all, even in persons who eventually recover, as in an instance
of recovery recorded by Dr. Kinnis.<a id='r1721' /><a href='#f1721' class='c013'><sup>[1721]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The pupils are always at least sluggish in their contractions, often
quite insensible;—sometimes, it is said, dilated:<a id='r1722' /><a href='#f1722' class='c013'><sup>[1722]</sup></a> but much more
commonly contracted, and occasionally to an extreme degree. In the
case last noticed, they were no bigger than a pin’s head. The pupils
have been so invariably found contracted in all recent cases of poisoning
with opium, that some doubt arises whether they are ever
otherwise, and whether the earlier accounts, which represent them
to have been dilated, may not be incorrect, and the result of hasty
observation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The expression of the countenance is for the most part remarkably
placid, like that of a person in sound natural sleep. Occasionally
there is an expression of anxiety mingled with the stupor. The face
is commonly pale. Sometimes, however, it is flushed;<a id='r1723' /><a href='#f1723' class='c013'><sup>[1723]</sup></a> and in rare
cases the expression is furious.<a id='r1724' /><a href='#f1724' class='c013'><sup>[1724]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In moderately large doses opium generally suspends the excretion
of urine and fæces; but it promotes perspiration. In dangerous cases
the lethargy is sometimes accompanied with copious sweating. In a
fatal case, which I examined judicially, the sheets were completely
soaked to a considerable distance around the body.</p>

<p class='c006'>A remarkable circumstance, which has been noticed by a late author,
is the sudden death of leeches applied to the body. The patient
was a child who had been poisoned by too strong an injection of
poppy-heads.<a id='r1725' /><a href='#f1725' class='c013'><sup>[1725]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In some instances the symptoms proper to poisoning with opium
become complicated with those which belong rather to organic affections
of the brain, in consequence of such affections being suddenly
developed through means of the cerebral congestion occasioned by
the poison. Thus, in a case related in Corvisart’s Journal, there
were convulsions and somnolency on the third day, and palsy of one
arm for four days; and for nearly two months afterwards the patient
complained of occasional attacks of weakness and numbness, sometimes
of one extremity, sometimes of another.<a id='r1726' /><a href='#f1726' class='c013'><sup>[1726]</sup></a> Here the brain must
have sustained some more permanent injury than usual.—A more
remarkable illustration once occurred to Dr. Elliotson. A young
man, seven hours after swallowing two ounces of laudanum, presented
the usual effects of opium, such as contracted pupils, redness of the
features, a frequent feeble pulse, coldness of the integuments, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_547'>547</span>stupor, from which he could be roused without particular difficulty.
The stomach-pump brought away a fluid which had not any odour
of opium; powerful stimulants were given, such as ether, ammonia
and brandy; and he was kept constantly walking between two men.
In an hour and a half, when sensibility had been materially restored,
his head suddenly dropped down upon his breast, and he fell down
dead. The sinuses and veins of the brain were turgid, and a moderately
thick layer of blood was effused over the arachnoid membrane.<a id='r1727' /><a href='#f1727' class='c013'><sup>[1727]</sup></a>—Under
the same head must be arranged the following extraordinary
case related by Pyl. That author admits it as one of simple
poisoning, with a complete remission of the symptoms for several
days. But the possibility of such a remission must be received
with great hesitation. It is well known that most of the symptoms
may be dispelled by vigorous treatment, and the patient nevertheless
relapse immediately if left to himself, and even die. This is acknowledged
on all hands. Pyl, however, admits the possibility of
a much more complete and longer interval. His case is shortly as
follows. A man who had taken a large quantity of opium, and became
very dangerously ill, was made to vomit in twelve hours, and
regained his senses completely. The bowels continued obstinately
costive; but he had for some days no other symptom referrible to the
poison; when at length the whole body became gradually palsied
and stiff, and he died on the tenth day. No importance can be attached
to a solitary case differing so widely from every other. The
only way in which opium could cause death in such a manner, must
be by calling forth some disposition to natural disease. Pyl’s case
was probably one of supervening <i>ramollissement</i>, or inflammation of
the substance of the brain.<a id='r1728' /><a href='#f1728' class='c013'><sup>[1728]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Notwithstanding the purely narcotic or nervous symptoms, which
opium produces in a vast proportion of instances, there is no doubt
that it also excites in a few rare cases those of irritation. Thus, although
it generally constipates the bowels, it has been known to induce
diarrhœa or colic in particular constitutions. In the first volume
of the Medical Communications, it is observed by Michaëlis that
both diarrhœa and diuresis may be produced by it. The soldier,
whose case was quoted as having been accompanied with convulsions,
had acute pain in the stomach for some time after swallowing
the poison; and in the case just quoted from Corvisart’s Journal,
the accession of somnolency was attended with excruciating pain of
two days’ duration.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another and more singular anomaly is the spontaneous occurrence
of vomiting. Sometimes a little vomiting immediately succeeds the
taking of the poison. This may not interrupt, however, the progress
of the symptoms;<a id='r1729' /><a href='#f1729' class='c013'><sup>[1729]</sup></a> but more commonly it is the means of saving
the person’s life, as in a striking case described by Petit of an English
officer,<a id='r1730' /><a href='#f1730' class='c013'><sup>[1730]</sup></a> who, in consequence of vomiting immediately after
taking two ounces of laudanum, had only moderate somnolency. At
<span class='pageno' id='Page_548'>548</span>other times vomiting occurs at a much later period. Pyl, in his
Essays and Observations, gives a case in which, some hours after
thirty grains were swallowed, vomiting took place spontaneously,
and recurred frequently afterwards; in the same paper is an account
of another case by the individual himself, who attempted to commit
suicide by taking a large dose of laudanum, but was disappointed in
consequence of the poison being spontaneously vomited after the
sopor had fairly set in;<a id='r1731' /><a href='#f1731' class='c013'><sup>[1731]</sup></a> and a similar case is related by M. Mascarel,
where, after seven ounces of Sydenham’s laudanum had been taken,
vomiting occurred spontaneously, and was followed only by inconsiderable
stupor.<a id='r1732' /><a href='#f1732' class='c013'><sup>[1732]</sup></a>—Vomiting is a common enough symptom after
the administration of emetics, or subsequent to the departure of the
somnolency.<a id='r1733' /><a href='#f1733' class='c013'><sup>[1733]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>ordinary duration</i> of a fatal case of poisoning with opium is
from seven to twelve hours. Most people recover who outlive twelve
hours. At the same time fatal cases of longer duration are on record:
Réaumur mentions one which proved fatal in fifteen hours,<a id='r1734' /><a href='#f1734' class='c013'><sup>[1734]</sup></a> Orfila
another fatal in seventeen hours,<a id='r1735' /><a href='#f1735' class='c013'><sup>[1735]</sup></a> Leroux another fatal in the same
time,<a id='r1736' /><a href='#f1736' class='c013'><sup>[1736]</sup></a> Alibert another fatal in nearly twenty-four hours.<a id='r1737' /><a href='#f1737' class='c013'><sup>[1737]</sup></a> An instance
has even been related, which appeared to prove fatal not till
towards the close of the third day;<a id='r1738' /><a href='#f1738' class='c013'><sup>[1738]</sup></a> but the whole course of the
symptoms was in that case so unusual, that some other cause must
have co-operated in occasioning death. Sometimes, too, death takes
place in a shorter time than seven hours; six hours is not an uncommon
duration; I once met with a judicial case, which could not
have lasted above five hours; an infirmary patient of my colleague,
Dr. Home, died in four hours; in the 31st volume of the Medical and
Physical Journal, there is one which proved fatal in three hours.<a id='r1739' /><a href='#f1739' class='c013'><sup>[1739]</sup></a>
This is the shortest I have read of.</p>

<p class='c006'>The dose of opium requisite to cause death has not been determined.
Indeed it must vary so much with circumstances, that it is
almost vain to attempt to fix it. Pyl relates a case, quickly fatal,
where the quantity taken was 60 grains;<a id='r1740' /><a href='#f1740' class='c013'><sup>[1740]</sup></a> Lassus an instance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_549'>549</span>death from 36 grains;<a id='r1741' /><a href='#f1741' class='c013'><sup>[1741]</sup></a> Wildberg has related a fatal case caused by
little more than half an ounce of the Berlin tincture,<a id='r1742' /><a href='#f1742' class='c013'><sup>[1742]</sup></a> which contains
the soluble matter of forty grains; and Mr. Skae has mentioned
a case fatal in about thirteen hours, where the dose seems to have
been well ascertained not to have exceeded half an ounce of common
laudanum, or about twenty grains of opium.<a id='r1743' /><a href='#f1743' class='c013'><sup>[1743]</sup></a> Dr. Paris, without
quoting any particular fact, says four grains may prove fatal.<a id='r1744' /><a href='#f1744' class='c013'><sup>[1744]</sup></a> I
should have felt some difficulty in admitting this statement, as I have
repeatedly known persons, unaccustomed to opium, take three or
four grains without any other effect than sound sleep. But I have
been favoured with the particulars of a case by Mr. W. Brown of
this city, where a dose of four grains and a half, taken by an adult
along with nine grains of camphor, was followed by the usual
signs of narcotism, and death in nine hours. The man took the
opium for a cough at seven in the morning; at nine his wife found
him in a deep sleep, from which she could not rouse him; nothing
was done for his relief till three in the afternoon, when Mr. Brown
found him labouring under all the usual symptoms of poisoning with
opium, contracted pupils among the rest; and death ensued in an
hour, notwithstanding the active employment of remedies. On examining
the body no morbid appearance was found of any note except
fluidity of the blood,—a common appearance in those who have
died of the effects of this drug.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is more important than may at first sight be imagined to acquire
an approximative knowledge of the smallest fatal dose. For, in consequence
of the dread entertained of opium by many unprofessional
persons, it is currently believed to be much more active than it is in
reality; and instances of natural death have been consequently imputed
to medicinal doses taken fortuitously a short time before. The
facts stated above comprehend the only precise information I have
been able to collect as to the smallest fatal doses in adults. I may
add some farther observations, however, on the smallest fatal doses
in children. Very young children are often peculiarly sensible to
the poisonous action of opium, so that it is scarcely possible to use
the most insignificant doses with safety. Sundeling states in general
terms that extremely small doses are very dangerous to infants on
account of the rapidity of absorption. This opinion is amply supported
by the following cases.—An infant three days old got by
mistake about the fourth part of a mixture containing ten drops of
laudanum. No medical man was called for eleven hours. At that
time there was great somnolency and feebleness, but the child could
be roused. The breathing being very slow, artificial respiration was
resorted to, but without advantage: the child died in twenty-four
hours, the character of the symptoms remaining unchanged to the last.
At the inspection of the body, which I witnessed, no morbid appearance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_550'>550</span>was found.—Of the same kind was a case communicated
to me by Dr. Simson of this city, where the administration of three
drops of laudanum in a chalk mixture, for diarrhœa, to a stout child
fourteen months old, was followed by coma, convulsions, and death
in about six hours. Dr. Simson satisfied himself, as far as that was
possible, that the apothecary who made up the mixture did not
commit a mistake.—Dr. Kelso of Lisburn met with a similar case in
an infant of nine months, who died in nine hours after taking four
drops.<a id='r1745' /><a href='#f1745' class='c013'><sup>[1745]</sup></a>—My colleague, Dr. Alison, tells me he has met with a case
where an infant a few weeks old died with all the symptoms of poisoning
with opium after receiving four drops of laudanum, and that
he has repeatedly seen unpleasant deep sleep induced by only two
drops.—These remarks being kept in view, it will, I suspect, be
difficult to go along with an opinion against poisoning expressed by
a German medico-legal physician in the following circumstances. A
child’s maid, pursuant to a common but dangerous custom among
nurses, gave a healthy infant, four weeks old, an anodyne draught
to quiet its screams. The infant soon fell fast asleep, but died comatose
in twelve hours. There was not any appearance of note in
the dead body; and the child was therefore universally thought to
have been killed by the draught. But the inspecting physician declared
that to be impossible, as the draught contained only an eighth
of a grain of opium and as much hyoscyamus.<a id='r1746' /><a href='#f1746' class='c013'><sup>[1746]</sup></a> In the first edition
of this work an opinion was expressed to the same purport. But the
facts stated above throw doubt on its accuracy, and rather show that
the dose was sufficient in the circumstances to occasion death.</p>

<p class='c006'>A very important circumstance to attend to in respect to the dose
of opium required to prove fatal is the influence of constitutional
circumstances in rendering this drug unusually energetic. In some
persons this peculiar anomaly exists always, even during a state of
health. Thus, I am acquainted with a gentleman on whom seven
drops of laudanum act with great certainty as a hypnotic. In such a
one doses, which are safely taken by many, might prove dangerous.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is more usual, however, to meet with this anomaly in the course
of some diseases. These have not yet been satisfactorily indicated.
I have several times, however, met with unusually energetic action
from medicinal doses in elderly persons affected with severe habitual
catarrh; and in one instance death occurred after a dose of twenty-five
drops in the advanced stage of acute catarrh supervening on its chronic
form, the symptoms being those of poisoning with opium, succeeding
apparently a state of comfortable sleep.—A case seemingly
of the same nature, where the dose was fifteen drops of Battley’s
Sedative Liquor, occurred at Islington in 1841. An elderly lady,
in delicate health, and affected severely with asthma, which for ten
days prevented her from sleeping, got from a neighbouring druggist
a draught of Battley’s solution, syrup, and camphor-mixture. Next
morning she was found insensible and livid in the face, with cold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_551'>551</span>extremities and contracted pupils; and she died about twelve hours
after taking the draught. There was no sign of natural disease in the
dead body to account for death. The druggist was absurdly blamed
for giving such a dose to a frail old lady; for the dose was not more
than would be generally given in such circumstances. This case
was communicated to me by the druggist in question.—Another of
the like kind has been communicated to me by Mr. Garstang of Clitheroe.
An elderly female, long subject to severe cough, having
enjoyed a comfortable night’s rest after a dose of a preparation containing
half a grain of opium, took in the morning the equivalent of
two grains and a half, or three grains at the utmost, and fell asleep soon
after. In no long time, her husband, alarmed because he could not
rouse her, sent for Mr. Garstang, who found her husband labouring
under all the symptoms of poisoning with opium; and, notwithstanding
active treatment, she died six hours after the second dose. Her husband
took half a grain with her the evening before, but experienced
no effect from it at all. Not the slightest ground could exist in this
case for suspecting either foul play or pharmaceutic error.—As a farther
illustration, the following incident deserves notice, which occurred
last year in London, and was communicated to me by Dr. G.
Johnson, a former pupil. A little girl, five years and a half old, affected
with violent cough, got a mixture containing opium, which was
repeated six, thirteen, and twenty-six hours afterwards. She slept
soundly after each dose, and awoke readily after the first three; but
after the fourth she had more stupor and much uneasiness; in which
state, but with at least one interval of sensibility, she died in nine
hours more, or thirty-five hours after the first dose. According to the
prescriber’s intention, the child ought to have taken only two minims
of laudanum in all; but, according to a rough analysis by Mr. Alfred
Taylor, each dose contained an eighth of a grain of opium, or a trifle
more. In either view it is impossible that doses so small, and so distant,
could produce these effects in ordinary circumstances.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such cases are important in several respects, but especially because
they naturally give rise to suspicions of an over-dose of opium having
been incautiously given, and thus to misrepresentations injurious to
the druggist or medical attendant. In the last case a Coroner’s Jury
brought in the preposterous verdict, that death was caused by “too
much opium ordered without due instructions.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It is scarcely necessary to add, that the dose required to prove fatal
is very much altered by habit. Those who have been accustomed to
eat opium are obliged gradually to increase the dose, otherwise its
usual effects are not produced. Some extraordinary, but I believe
correct information on this subject, is contained in the confessions of
an English opium-eater. The author took at one time 8000 drops
daily, or about nine ounces of laudanum.</p>

<p class='c006'>An important topic relative to the effects of opium on man is its operation
on the body when used continuously in the manner practised by
opium-eaters. This subject was brought forcibly under my notice in
1831, in consequence of a remarkable civil trial, in which I was concerned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_552'>552</span>as a medical witness,—that of Sir W. Forbes and company
against the Edinburgh Life Assurance Company. The late Earl of
Mar effected insurances on his life to a large amount while addicted
to the vice of opium-eating; which was not made known at the
time to the insurance company. He died two years afterwards of
jaundice and dropsy. The company refused payment, on the ground
that his lordship had concealed from them a habit which tends to
shorten life; and Sir W. Forbes and company, who held the policy
of insurance as security for money lent to the earl, raised an action to
recover payment.</p>

<p class='c006'>In consequence of inquiries made on this occasion, I became for
the first time aware of the frequency of the vice of opium-eating
among both the lower orders and the upper ranks of society; and at
the same time satisfied myself, that the habit is often easily concealed
from the most intimate friends,—that physicians even in extensive
practice seldom become acquainted with such cases,—that the effects
of the habit on the constitution are not always what either professional
persons or the unprofessional would expect,—and generally that practitioners
and toxicologists possess little or no precise information on
the matter. In what is about to be offered on the subject, some facts
will be stated which appear to me interesting, and may induce others
to contribute their knowledge towards filling up so important a blank
in medico-legal toxicology.</p>

<p class='c006'>The general impression is, that the practice of opium-eating injures
the health and shortens life. But the scientific physician in
modern times has seen so many proofs of the inaccuracy of popular
impressions relative to the operation of various agents on health and
longevity,<a id='r1747' /><a href='#f1747' class='c013'><sup>[1747]</sup></a> that he will not allow himself to be hastily carried along
in the present instance by vague popular belief. The general conviction
of the tendency of opium-eating to shorten life has obviously been derived
in part from the injurious effects which opium used medicinally
has on the nervous system and functions of the alimentary canal,—and
partly on the reports of travellers in Turkey and Persia, who have
enjoyed opportunities of watching the life and habits of opium-eaters
on a great scale. The statements of travellers, however, are so vague
that they cannot be turned to use with any confidence in a scientific
inquiry. Chardin, one of the earliest (1671) and best of modern
travellers in Turkey, merely says the opium-eater becomes rheumatic
at fifty, and “never reaches an extreme old age;”<a id='r1748' /><a href='#f1748' class='c013'><sup>[1748]</sup></a> and his
successors have seldom been more precise,—no one having given
information as to the diseases which it tends to engender. By far
the greater number of authorities, however, agree in representing the
practice to be hurtful. Mr. Madden, a recent and professional
authority, even alleges that it is very rare for an opium-eater at Constantinople
to outlive his thirtieth year, if he began the practice early.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_553'>553</span>On the other hand, a few late observers deny altogether the accuracy
of these statements. To this number belongs Dr. Burnes of the
Bombay army; whose opinion is worthy of notice, because he had ample
opportunities of observation during his residence in Cutch and at the
Court of Sinde for several years prior to 1831. From what he there
witnessed, Dr. Burnes is inclined to think “it will be found in general
that the natives do not suffer much from the use of opium,”—that
“this powerful narcotic does not seem to destroy the powers of the
body, nor to enervate the mind to the degree that might be imagined.”<a id='r1749' /><a href='#f1749' class='c013'><sup>[1749]</sup></a>
Dr. Macpherson of the Madras army, who had occasion
to observe the effects of the parallel practice of opium-smoking in
China, coincides in opinion with Dr. Burnes. He says, “were we
to be led away by the popular opinion that the habitual use of opium
injures the health and shortens life, we should expect to find the
Chinese a shrivelled, emaciated, idiotic race. On the contrary,
although the habit of smoking opium is universal among rich and
poor, we find them to be a powerful, muscular, and athletic people,
and the lower orders more intelligent and far superior in mental acquirements
to those of corresponding rank in our own country.”<a id='r1750' /><a href='#f1750' class='c013'><sup>[1750]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The familiar effects of the medicinal use of opium in disordering
the nervous system and the digestive functions constitute a better
reason, than the loose statements of eastern travellers, for the popular
impression of the danger of its habitual and long-continued use.
Yet this consideration ought not to be allowed too much weight;
because the functions of the nervous system and of digestion may be
deranged by other causes, for example by hysteria, without necessarily
and materially shortening life. It is desirable therefore to appeal
if possible to precise facts.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following is a summary of twenty-five cases, the particulars of
which I have obtained from various quarters. The general result
rather tends to throw doubt over the popular opinion.—1. A lady
about thirty, in good health, has taken it largely for twenty years,
having been gradually habituated to it from childhood by the villany
of her maid, who gave it frequently to keep her quiet. 2. A female
who died of consumption at the age of forty-two, had taken about a
drachm of solid opium for ten years, but had given up the practice
for three years before her death, and led in other respects a licentious
life from an early age. 3. A well-known literary author, about sixty
years of age, has taken laudanum for thirty-five years, with occasional
short intermissions, and sometimes an enormous quantity, but enjoys
tolerable bodily health. 4. A lady, after being in the practice of
drinking laudanum for at least twenty years, died at the age of fifty,—of
what disease I have been unable to learn. 5. A lady about
fifty-five, who enjoys good health, has taken opium many years, and
at present uses three ounces of laudanum daily. 6. A lady about
sixty gave it up after using it constantly for twenty years, during
which she enjoyed good health; and subsequently she resumed it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_554'>554</span>7. Lord Mar after using laudanum for thirty years, at times to the
amount of two or three ounces daily, died at the age of fifty-seven of
jaundice and dropsy; but he was a martyr to rheumatism, and besides
lived rather freely. 8. A woman, who had been in the practice of
taking about two ounces of laudanum daily for very many years, died
at the age of sixty or upwards. 9. An eminent literary character, who
died about the age of sixty-three, was in the practice of drinking
laudanum to excess from the age of fifteen; and his daily allowance
was sometimes a quart of a mixture consisting of three parts of laudanum
and one of alcohol. 10. A lady, who died lately at the age of
seventy-six, took laudanum in the quantity of half an ounce daily for
nearly forty years. 11. An old woman died not long ago at Leith
at the age of eighty, who had taken about half an ounce of laudanum
daily for nearly forty years, and enjoyed tolerable health all the
time. 12. Visrajee, a celebrated Cutchee chief, mentioned by Dr.
Burnes, had taken opium largely all his life, and was alive when Dr.
Burnes drew up his Narrative, at the age of eighty, “paralyzed by
years, but his mind unimpaired.”<a id='r1751' /><a href='#f1751' class='c013'><sup>[1751]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>For the particulars of the remaining cases I am indebted to Dr.
Tait, surgeon of police in this city. 13. M. C., a ruddy, healthy-looking
woman, sixty years of age, has taken laudanum for twenty-five
years to the extent of half an ounce daily in a single dose. 14.
M. H., a flabby, dissipated-looking woman of thirty-six, has taken for
ten years thirty grains of opium daily in three doses. 15. M. T.,
a widow, forty-eight years of age, who takes twice daily a dose of
one fluidrachm of laudanum, and has done so for fourteen years, cannot
observe any permanent injury except diminution of appetite. 16.
Mrs. G., aged twenty-four, has taken a single dose of sixty drops
regularly at bed-time for five years, and has not suffered in health in
any respect, except that she is costive. 17. F. S., a thin, sallow
woman of forty-six years of age, has taken a fluidrachm of laudanum
three times a day for ten years, cannot take food without it, but is so
well as to be able to get up regularly at six in the morning. 18. H.
S., a shrivelled old-looking woman, who for thirty-eight years had
taken daily towards a drachm of opium in one dose, and who latterly
was strong, lively, and of good appetite, died recently at the
age of sixty-nine. 19. Mrs. S., who has taken about a scruple of
opium for twenty-one years, is a tall, active, old-looking woman of
fifty-seven, enjoys good health when she uses the opium, but suffers
from an affection like delirium tremens, when she cannot get her
usual quantity. 20. M. A., aged thirty-one, has taken half a drachm
of opium daily in two doses for ten years, was a thin, drunken, starved-looking
prostitute some years ago, but, having reformed her ways, is
now “a fine-looking, bouncing woman,” younger in appearance than
formerly, and not liable to any suffering either before or after her
doses, except that she cannot take food without them. 21. Miss M.,
who has taken ten grains of opium three times a day for five years,
is a healthy, florid young woman of twenty-seven, liable to costiveness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_555'>555</span>and, when without her opium, to languor and want of appetite,
but otherwise free of complaint. 22. Mrs. ——, a plump, hale-looking
old lady of seventy, has taken opium for six and twenty years, and for
some years to the extent of a drachm daily in two doses. She thinks
her health improved by it, and has suffered no inconvenience except
merely costiveness, and always aversion to food till she gets her dose.
23. J. B., aged 23, has taken laudanum since she was fourteen, and some
time past to the amount of an ounce or ten drachms in three or four
doses daily. She has only menstruated twice since first using the
laudanum, has bilious vomiting once a month, and looks older than
her years, but is otherwise quite healthy, and has two children. 24.
Mrs. M’C., a ruddy young-looking woman of forty-two, has taken
opium during two years for cough and pain in the stomach, latterly
to the extent of ten grains twice a day. She has never menstruated
since, but has enjoyed better health, and in particular has a good
appetite after her dose, and has got entirely quit of a former tendency
to constipation. 25. An army officer’s widow, fifty-five years old,
healthy and young-looking, although subject to costiveness and rather
defective appetite, has taken laudanum for eleven years, and latterly
opium to the extent of fifteen grains morning and evening.</p>

<p class='c006'>These facts tend on the whole rather to show, that the practice of
eating opium is not so injurious, and an opium eater’s life not so uninsurable,
as is commonly thought; and that an insured person, who
did not make known this habit, could scarcely be considered guilty
of concealment to the effect of voiding his insurance. But I am far
from thinking,—as several represent who have quoted this work,—that
what has now been stated can with justice be held to establish
such important inferences; for there is an obvious reason, why in
an inquiry of this kind those instances chiefly should come under
notice where the constitution has escaped injury, cases fatal in early
life being more apt to be lost sight of, or more likely to be concealed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Meanwhile, insurance companies and insurance physicians ought
to be aware, that not a few persons in the upper ranks of life are confirmed
opium-eaters without even their intimate friends knowing it.
And the reason is, that at the time the opium-eater is visible to his
friends, namely, during the period of excitement, there is frequently
nothing in his behaviour or appearance to attract particular attention.
From the information I have received, it appears that the British
opium-eater is by no means subject to the extraordinary excitement
of mind and body described by travellers as the effect of opium-eating
in Turkey and Persia; but that the common effect merely is to remove
torpor and sluggishness, and make him in the eyes of his friends an
active and conversible man. The prevailing notions of the nature
of the excitement from eating opium are therefore very much exaggerated.
Another singular circumstance I have ascertained is, that
constipation is by no means a general effect of the continued use of
opium. In some of the cases mentioned above no laxatives have been
required; and in others a gentle laxative once a week is sufficient.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the civil suit regarding Lord Mar’s insurances, the insurance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_556'>556</span>company was at first found not entitled to refuse payment,—not,
however, on the ground that the habit of opium-eating is harmless to
longevity,—but chiefly on a technical ground, implying that they
did not make inquiry into his habits with the care usually observed
by insurance companies, and were therefore to be understood as accepting
the life at a venture. A new trial was granted by the court
on the ground of the judge’s charge having been not according to
evidence; but on this occasion the parties compromised the case.<a id='r1752' /><a href='#f1752' class='c013'><sup>[1752]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The previous remarks on the symptoms of poisoning with opium
in man have been confined to its effects when swallowed. But it
was mentioned under the head of its mode of action, that this poison
has been known to act with energy upon animals through every channel
by which it can be introduced into the system. It is natural to
expect that the same will be the case with man also.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only other modes in which poisoning with opium is reported
to have been produced in man, besides administration by the mouth,
have been by injections into the anus, by application to the skin deprived
of its cuticle, perhaps even also to the unbroken skin, and by
its introduction into the external opening of the ear.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the Journal de Chimie Médicale, an instance is shortly noticed
of a lady who was poisoned by the administration of too strong an
anodyne injection prepared by herself from fresh poppy-heads. She
recovered.<a id='r1753' /><a href='#f1753' class='c013'><sup>[1753]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It is generally believed in France that opium acts more energetically
through the medium of the rectum, than through the stomach.
Orfila in particular has endeavoured to establish this proposition by
experiments on animals, and quotations from cases recorded by some
authors of its action upon man.<a id='r1754' /><a href='#f1754' class='c013'><sup>[1754]</sup></a> But neither the experiments nor
the quotations appear to me satisfactory; and the rule they go to support
is completely at variance with the practice pursued in the medicinal
administration of the drug in Britain. It is the custom to give
at least twice as much in an enema as in a draught. I have given
by injection, without producing more than the usual somnolency, one
drachm and even two drachms by measure of laudanum, a dose
which, were Orfila’s statement correct, would prove fatal.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the action of opium through the skin when deprived of its
cuticle, I am not acquainted with any fatal case of the kind, but
have no doubt that such may happen. One of my friends very nearly
lost his life in the way alluded to. He had applied an opium-poultice
to the scrotum to allay the violent irritation caused by a blister,
and fell into a state of profound sopor, which was luckily interrupted
by a visitor, so that the cause was discovered before it was too late.
An instance of the same kind has also been published by M. Pelletan.
A child two months old very nearly perished, in consequence of a
cerate containing fifteen drops of laudanum having been kept for
twenty-four hours on a slight excoriation produced by a fold of the
skin. When the cause of illness was discovered, the child had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_557'>557</span>for some hours almost completely insensible, with a slow, obscure
pulse, and occasional convulsions.<a id='r1755' /><a href='#f1755' class='c013'><sup>[1755]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>But perhaps opium may in some circumstances act even through
the unbroken skin. It has certainly been often applied in this way
to relieve local pain without avail. Yet on the other hand its effect
is at times unequivocal; and the following incidents seem to show,
that it may even prove fatal, both when the skin is healthy, and in
certain diseased states of the integuments. A young dramatic writer
in Paris was directed by his father, a physician, to apply over the
stomach a poultice moistened with a few drops of laudanum. The
patient, in order to relieve his pain more quickly, poured the whole
contents of the bottle over the poultice, and soon fell into a deep
sleep. Prompt assistance was obtained, but proved of no avail, and
death is said to have ensued with great rapidity.<a id='r1756' /><a href='#f1756' class='c013'><sup>[1756]</sup></a> A soldier affected
with erysipelas of the leg, had a linseed poultice applied, which his
surgeon ordered to be sprinkled with 15 drops of laudanum. Next
morning the patient was found in a state of deep sopor, accompanied
with convulsive twitches of the muscles of the face and limbs; and
in no long time he expired. His soporose state turned the surgeon’s
attention to the poultice, which he found coloured yellow and smelling
strongly of opium; and on removing it he discovered that it was
completely soaked with laudanum, which the attendant had carelessly
poured on it to the extent of an ounce. The patient died notwithstanding
all the remedies which his state called for; and the viscera
were found quite healthy; but in many places the blood is said to
have had a strong odour of opium.<a id='r1757' /><a href='#f1757' class='c013'><sup>[1757]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In an instance reported by M. Tournon of Bordeaux, death is supposed
to have arisen from the introduction of opium into the external
opening of the ear, as a remedy for ear-ache. It is possible that
fatal poisoning may thus be induced by laudanum too freely and frequently
renewed: but it seems very unlikely that death was owing
to opium in the instance in question, since it was used in the solid
form, and in the quantity of four grains; so that the dose was small,
and absorption must have been very slow. The account merely states
that the patient fell asleep, but his sleep was that of death.<a id='r1758' /><a href='#f1758' class='c013'><sup>[1758]</sup></a></p>

<h5 class='c011'><i>Of the Action of Morphia, Narcotine, Codeïa, and Meconic Acid.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>The action and symptoms caused by two active principles of
opium, morphia, and narcotine, have been examined by many experimentalists.</p>

<p class='c006'>The action of <i>morphia</i> is nearly the same as that of opium, but
more energetic. In its solid state it has little effect, being nearly
insoluble. But when dissolved in olive oil, or in alcohol, or in weak
acids, it excites in animals the same symptoms as opium. Experimentalists
are not yet agreed as to its power. The trial of Castaing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_558'>558</span>gave rise to a physiological inquiry by three French physicians, Deguise,
Dupuy, and Leuret, who assigned to it feeble properties; but
more reliance is usually placed in the experiments of Orfila, who
found that one part of morphia is equal in energy to two parts of the
watery extract, and to four parts of crude opium. The observations
I have made on the medicinal effects of morphia and its muriate, lead
me to believe that half a grain is fully equal in power to three grains
of the best Turkey-opium. Probably those who have observed but
slight effects from it have accidentally used narcotine instead of it;
for at one time they were often confounded together.</p>

<p class='c006'>On man morphia acts like opium; it produces somnolency. It
was at one time thought that in medicinal doses it does not produce
either the disagreeable subsequent or idiosyncratic effects of opium;
Magendie made some observations to this purport;<a id='r1759' /><a href='#f1759' class='c013'><sup>[1759]</sup></a> and Dr. Quadri
of Naples was led to the same conclusion.<a id='r1760' /><a href='#f1760' class='c013'><sup>[1760]</sup></a> Others, however, have
doubted the accuracy of these authors, and opposite results appear to
have been procured by some. My own experience with the muriate
of morphia inclines me to concur in opinion with Magendie and
Quadri.</p>

<p class='c006'>The effects of morphia on man in fatal doses have hitherto been
observed in a few cases only. An instance, which was the occasion
of a criminal trial at Aberdeen in 1842, has been communicated to me
by Dr. Traill, who was consulted in the case on the part of the crown.
A schoolmaster gave ten grains of the muriate to a girl immediately
after she came out of an epileptic fit. In fifteen minutes she seemed
to fall asleep; she continued in this state for some hours before it
was discovered that she was in a state of stupor, from which she could
not be roused; and she expired twelve hours after the poison was
administered. A similar case occasioned by ten grains, and also
fatal, occurred at Cheltenham in 1839.</p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila relates the particulars of the case of a young Parisian graduate,
who swallowed twenty-two grains for the purpose of self-destruction.
In ten minutes he felt heat in the stomach and hindhead,
with excessive itchiness; in three hours and a half he had also a
sense of pricking in the eyes, with dimness of vision; and in an
hour more he for the first time felt approaching stupor. Half an hour
afterwards, when the people of the house entered his room he could
not see them, though he was sensible enough to be able to reply to
their inquiries, that he lay in bed because he had not slept the night
before. Soon after this he fell into a state of profound stupor and
lost all consciousness. In thirteen hours he was visited by Orfila,
who found him cold, quite comatose, and affected with locked-jaw;
the pupils were feebly dilated, the pulse 120, the breathing
hurried and stertorous, the belly tense and tympanitic; and there
were occasional convulsions, with intense itching of the skin. By
means of copious venesection, sinapisms, ammoniated friction, stimulant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_559'>559</span>clysters, ice on the head, and acidulous drinks, he was gradually
roused, so that in six hours he recognised his physician. In the subsequent
night and following day he had difficult and scanty micturition,
with pain in the kidneys and bladder, and difficulty in swallowing;
but these symptoms went off during the second night; and on
the third morning he was quite well.<a id='r1761' /><a href='#f1761' class='c013'><sup>[1761]</sup></a> The itching of the skin remarked
in this case is considered by M. Bally an invariable symptom
of the operation of morphia even in medicinal doses.<a id='r1762' /><a href='#f1762' class='c013'><sup>[1762]</sup></a> It is not,
however, always produced.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another case, which occurred at Lunéville, is very remarkable in
its circumstances. A young man addicted to opium-eating, but who
had left off the practice for a twelvemonth, took first ten grains, and
in ten minutes forty grains more of acetate of morphia. In five minutes
he had excessive general feebleness and a sense of impending
dissolution, which forced him to confess what he had done. In fifteen
minutes more M. Castara, who describes the particulars, found
him motionless, almost comatose, and breathing laboriously. The
limbs were flaccid, the pupils contracted, the face and lips livid,
the skin warm and moist, the pulse full and hard, and deglutition impossible.
Tartar-emetic was ordered, but could not be administered.
He was then bled at the arm to eighteen ounces; upon which he
started as from sleep, rubbed his eyes, said every thing turned round
him, and that he could not see the people present. When left to
himself he quickly fell into a calm slumber; but if kept awake, he
told collectedly all that happened before he became comatose. He
complained chiefly of intense itching and a general sense of bruising.
In an hour, by keeping him constantly roused, consciousness was
almost restored, and this without vomiting having been produced,
though two grains of tartar-emetic had been swallowed and three
administered by the rectum. In four hours after he swallowed the
poison he vomited freely and had diarrhœa. He then steadily recovered,
the sleepiness continued all next day, and the itching of the
skin even longer.<a id='r1763' /><a href='#f1763' class='c013'><sup>[1763]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>M. Julia-Fontenelle met with a case of poisoning with this alkaloid,
in consequence of its having been administered with a clyster
in the form of sulphate. The subject was a child five years old, the
dose five grains, the symptoms those of apoplexy, and death supervened
within twenty-four hours.<a id='r1764' /><a href='#f1764' class='c013'><sup>[1764]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Another case worthy of particular mention is that of the French
gentleman who was supposed to have been poisoned by Dr. Castaing.
It is not a pure one, for besides the symptoms of a consumptive
complaint under which he had laboured for some time, there
were circumstances in his last illness which indicated the administration
of other deleterious substances. About thirty-six hours before
his death, however, they were exactly such as might be expected
from a large dose of morphia. About five minutes after the administration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_560'>560</span>of a draught by the prisoner, the gentleman was attacked
with convulsions, and not long afterwards his physician found him
quite insensible, unable to swallow, bathed in a cold sweat, with a
small pulse, a burning skin, the jaws locked, the neck rigid, the belly
tense, and the limbs affected with spasmodic convulsions. In this
state he seems to have continued till his death. The only appearances
found in the dead body, which bore any relation to the poison
suspected, were congestion of blood and serous effusion in the vessels
of the cerebral membranes. If morphia was the cause of death,
it is highly probable that, besides what was administered thirty-six
hours before he died, several doses were given subsequently;
otherwise, from what is known of the action of opium, the narcotism
could scarcely have lasted uninterruptedly for so long a period.<a id='r1765' /><a href='#f1765' class='c013'><sup>[1765]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>For the following extraordinary case I am indebted to one of my
pupils, Mr. Clark of Montrose: A woman took one morning by
mistake ten grains of pure muriate of morphia, which had been prepared
not long before by Mr. Clark in my laboratory, and was freed
of codeïa. The mistake having been discovered almost immediately,
means were taken to prevent any ill effects from the accident, and
within half an hour after the poison was swallowed, the stomach was
completely cleared by the stomach-pump. At this time she was
quite sensible. But stupor quickly came on after the poison was
evacuated, and deep imperturbable coma gradually formed, so that
nothing could rouse her in the slightest degree except cold affusion
of the head and chest, which caused faint signs of returning consciousness.
Before night she expired, though all the usual remedies
were resorted to. An inspection of the body was not obtained,
which is much to be regretted, since without it the case is quite obscure.
I do not know a single instance of fatal coma from opium
where the proper remedies were resorted to before the stupor commenced;
and death in such circumstances is so inconceivable, that
we must ascribe the result in this case to apoplexy, either incidentally
concurring, or brought on by the operation of the poison.</p>

<p class='c006'>Morphia, like opium, may occasion serous effects when too freely
applied to a blistered surface. In a case related by M. Dupont, four-tenths
of a grain of acetate of morphia, applied to a blister on the
side, caused in twenty minutes dimness of vision, vomiting, and delirium;
and though it was then removed, the patient had afterwards
continued vomiting, dilated pupils, and great feebleness of the pulse.
Recovery took place, but the patient was not quite free of incoherence
next day.<a id='r1766' /><a href='#f1766' class='c013'><sup>[1766]</sup></a> The dose here was so small, and the symptoms
were so unlike the usual effects of morphia, that doubts arise whether
the case was really one of poisoning.</p>

<p class='c006'>The effects of <i>narcotine</i> have been examined experimentally by
Magendie and Orfila; but their results do not coincide. According
to Orfila it is not easy to poison dogs with it, as it excites vomiting
and is discharged. But when the gullet is tied, the animal dies in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_561'>561</span>two, three or four days, without any remarkable symptom but languor
and hard breathing.<a id='r1767' /><a href='#f1767' class='c013'><sup>[1767]</sup></a> In these experiments it was dissolved in
olive oil; it does not act at all in the solid state. Magendie found
that it produces in dogs a state like reverie, accompanied with convulsions.
They lie still except when convulsed, and they are apparently
asleep or dreaming; but they are really alive to external
objects, and even in a state of acute irritability. In short, he considers
the symptoms to constitute an aggravated form of the subsequent
and idiosyncratic effects caused by opium on man. Vinegar, he says,
destroys altogether the poisonous properties of narcotine. According
to Orfila it only weakens them. Muriatic acid would seem to annihilate
them entirely; for Orfila found no effect in dogs from forty
grains dissolved in water with the aid of muriatic acid; and Bally
gave sixty grains in like manner to a patient without injury.<a id='r1768' /><a href='#f1768' class='c013'><sup>[1768]</sup></a> Forty
grains dissolved by sulphuric acid, proved fatal to a dog in twenty-four
hours.<a id='r1769' /><a href='#f1769' class='c013'><sup>[1769]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Narcotine, like other narcotic poisons, is more powerful when introduced
at once into the blood, but produces nearly the same effects
as when it is swallowed. Orfila found that a single grain was as
powerful through the former, as eight grains through the latter
channel.<a id='r1770' /><a href='#f1770' class='c013'><sup>[1770]</sup></a> Dieffenbach observed that half a grain dissolved in water
by means of a drop or two of hydrochloric acid killed cats in five
minutes when injected into a vein, and always produced congestion
within the head, and extravasation on the surface of the cerebellum.
A remarkable circumstance observed in the course of his experiments
was, that leeches, applied to a rabbit under the influence of
narcotine, died immediately in convulsions; and that a portion of
the blood of the same rabbit when injected into the vein of another
produced drowsiness, languor, and pandiculation for nearly a day.<a id='r1771' /><a href='#f1771' class='c013'><sup>[1771]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The effects of narcotine on man have not been much inquired into.
From the only researches on the subject I have yet seen, those of
Dr. Wibmer of Munich, it appears to be but a feeble poison. He
found by experiment on himself, that two grains dissolved in olive oil
produced merely slight transient headache; that eight grains dissolved
by means of muriatic acid had no effect at all; and that the same quantity
of solid narcotine occasioned temporary headache, and in twenty-eight
hours a singular state of excitement, with trembling of the
hands, restlessness, and inability to fix the thoughts on any object.
These effects went off in a few hours.<a id='r1772' /><a href='#f1772' class='c013'><sup>[1772]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The effects of <i>codeïa</i> have been examined by Dr. Kunkel. He
found that twelve grains, dissolved in water and introduced into the
stomach, killed a rabbit in three minutes; that six grains in solution
when injected into the cellular tissue occasioned death in little more
than two hours; that the same quantity administered by the mouth
sometimes had little effect; that when given in powder its action
<span class='pageno' id='Page_562'>562</span>was very feeble; and that the symptoms were excitement of the
pulse, convulsions, and tetanus, without any tendency to sopor or
somnolency.<a id='r1773' /><a href='#f1773' class='c013'><sup>[1773]</sup></a> Hence codeïa is conceived to be a stimulant of the
nervous system, and consequently the cause of the excitant effects
sometimes produced by opium. It may be doubted, however,
whether its proportion in opium is sufficient for explaining these
effects.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Meconic acid</i> is inert. Sertuerner, indeed, thought the meconate
of soda acted as a powerful poison in some experiments made on
himself and on dogs; but more careful researches have since proved
that he was misled by some error. Sömmering found that ten grains
of meconic acid or meconate of soda had no effect whatever on dogs.<a id='r1774' /><a href='#f1774' class='c013'><sup>[1774]</sup></a>
Subsequently, in consequence of two people having died suddenly at
Turin after taking each a grain of the acid, some careful experiments
were made by Drs. Feneglio and Blengini, who gave eight grains to
dogs, crows, and frogs, and four grains to various men, without remarking
any injurious effects whatever.<a id='r1775' /><a href='#f1775' class='c013'><sup>[1775]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>distilled water</i> of opium was formerly considered an active
poison; but Orfila found it nearly or altogether inert. Two pounds
introduced into the stomach of a dog, and two ounces and a half
injected into a vein, had no effect whatever.<a id='r1776' /><a href='#f1776' class='c013'><sup>[1776]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> III.—<i>Of the Morbid Appearances caused by Opium.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>In discussing this subject the appearances in the best marked cases
will be first noticed; and then some account; will be given of the
variations to which they are liable.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Knape’s Annals there is a good example of the most aggravated
state of the appearances left by opium. It is the case of an
infant who was killed in the course of a night by a decoction of
poppy-heads. There was much lividity over the whole back part
of the body. All the sinuses and vessels of the brain were gorged
with fluid blood; and a good deal of serosity was found in the ventricles
and base of the skull. The pharynx was red. The lungs
were distended, and so gorged with fluid blood, that it ran out in a
stream when they were cut. The cavities of the heart contained the
same fluid blood. There was some redness in the villous coat of
the stomach and intestines; and poppy-seeds were found in the
stomach. Although the body had been kept only two days in the
month of February, the belly emitted a putrid odour when it was
laid open.<a id='r1777' /><a href='#f1777' class='c013'><sup>[1777]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In commenting upon these appearances, it may be first remarked,
that turgescence of the vessels in the brain, and watery effusion into
the ventricles, and on the surface of the brain, are generally met
with. Dr. Bright mentions an instance where unusual turgescence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_563'>563</span>was found, and on the surface of the brain a spot of slight ecchymosis
as big as a crown piece.<a id='r1778' /><a href='#f1778' class='c013'><sup>[1778]</sup></a> I have seen turgescence of vessels and
serous effusion in one instance to a considerable extent: each ventricle
contained three drachms of fluid, the arachnoid membrane on
the surface of the brain was much infiltered, and the vessels both in
the substance and on the surface of the brain were considerably
gorged with blood. But congestion and effusion are by no means
universal: in a case I examined judicially in November, 1822, which
proved fatal in about seven hours, there was neither unusual congestion
nor effusion. In the remarks on the diseased appearances caused
by the narcotics generally, it was observed that extravasation of
blood is a very rare effect of opium. A good example of the kind,
however, is related by Mr. Jewel of London. It was the case of a
young married female, who died eight hours after taking two ounces
of laudanum. Several clots were found in the substance of the brain,
one of which, in the anterior right lobe, was an inch long.<a id='r1779' /><a href='#f1779' class='c013'><sup>[1779]</sup></a> A
similar case, which occurred to Dr. Elliotson, has been mentioned
already at p. <a href='#Page_546'>546</a>. There is little doubt that poisoning with opium
may cause extravasation, by developing a disposition to apoplexy;
but considering the very great rarity of this appearance in persons
killed by opium, it may reasonably be questioned whether extravasation
can be produced without some predisposition co-operating.</p>

<p class='c006'>The lungs are sometimes found gorged with blood, as in many
cases of apoplexy. They were so in the soldier mentioned in the
Journal Universel, who died in convulsions. They were in the
same state in a patient of Dr. Home, a man who died in the Infirmary
here in 1825, four hours after taking two ounces of laudanum
in six ounces of whisky; and likewise in the case quoted from Pyl,
in which sixty grains of solid opium were taken. But this appearance
is not more constant than congestion in the brain. Orfila never
found it in dogs, and in three cases I have examined the lungs were
perfectly natural. Perhaps they are more usually turgid when death
is preceded by convulsions. They were particularly so in the case
of the soldier above mentioned, and likewise in another case of the
same nature recorded in Rust’s Magazin.<a id='r1780' /><a href='#f1780' class='c013'><sup>[1780]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The stomach, as in Knape’s case, is occasionally red, and in the
woman mentioned by Lassus, who died after swallowing thirty-six
grains, it is said to have been inflamed. But even redness is rare,
and decided inflammation probably never occurs. In four cases I
have examined, the villous coat was quite healthy; and it was
equally so in another related in Knape and Hecker’s Register.<a id='r1781' /><a href='#f1781' class='c013'><sup>[1781]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Lividity of the skin is almost always present more or less, and
sometimes it is excessive. In one of the cases I examined it was
universal over the depending surface of the body.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been said that the blood is always fluid. This certainly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_564'>564</span>appears to be very generally the case. For example, the blood was
fluid in the case of the soldier who died in convulsions, in Dr. Home’s
patient, in four adults I have examined, in Dr. Traill’s case of death
from morphia, and likewise in Pyl’s case. But at the same time
this condition of the blood is not invariable: In the case related in
Knape and Hecker’s Register, it was coagulated in the left cavities
of the heart; in another related by Petit in Corvisart’s Journal,
there were clots in both ventricles;<a id='r1782' /><a href='#f1782' class='c013'><sup>[1782]</sup></a> and in the case of the first infant
mentioned in page <a href='#Page_549'>549</a>, clots were also found in both ventricles. In
Alibert’s case a large fibrinous concretion was found in the heart,
clearly showing that the blood had coagulated after death as usual.</p>

<p class='c006'>It appears that the body is often apt to pass rapidly into putrefaction.
In one of the cases I examined, although the body had been
kept only thirty hours in a cool place in the month of December,
the cuticle was easily peeled off, the joints were flaccid, and an acid
smell was exhaled. In Réaumur’s case, that of a young man who
died in fifteen hours, in consequence of his companions in a drunken
frolic having mixed a drachm of opium in his wine, the body soon
became covered with large blue stains, and gave out an insupportable
odour. A French physician has related in the Journal de Médecine
a still more pointed case of a lady who died seven hours after taking
a large quantity of laudanum by mistake, and whose body was so
far gone in putrefaction fourteen hours after death, that the dissection
could not be delayed any longer. The hair and cuticle separated
on the slightest friction, and the stomach, intestines, and large vessels
were distended with air.<a id='r1783' /><a href='#f1783' class='c013'><sup>[1783]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It is doubtful whether this is a constant appearance or not. In one
case I examined, the body was free from putrefaction forty-eight hours
after death.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although opium is generally believed to suspend all the secretions
and excretions but the sweat, instances have been met with where a
great collection of urine was found in the bladder after death. In a
paper on the signs of death by opium, in Augustin’s Repertorium, it is
stated that Welper of Berlin always found the bladder full of urine,
and the kidneys gorged with blood, both in man and animals.<a id='r1784' /><a href='#f1784' class='c013'><sup>[1784]</sup></a> I am
not prepared to say how far this is a common condition, as the state of
the urinary organs is seldom noticed in published cases.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the examination of the dead body unequivocal evidence will
sometimes be procured by the discovery of a portion of the poison in
the stomach. But it must not always be concluded that opium has
not been swallowed, because the sense of smell, chemical analysis, and
experiments on animals fail to detect it. For, as previously remarked,
the opium may not remain in the stomach after death, though a large
quantity was swallowed, and not vomited. This may arise from two
causes. It may be all absorbed, as will often happen when it has
been taken in the liquid form: or it may be partly absorbed and partly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_565'>565</span>decomposed by the process of digestion. But in one or other of these
ways it may certainly disappear, and that in a very few hours only.
Several instances to this effect have been already mentioned (pp. <a href='#Page_57'>57</a>,
537). These remarks are important, because the fact is generally
believed to be the reverse. Dr. Paris, in his work on Medical Jurisprudence,
has tended to propagate the misconception, by asserting
that in all fatal cases opium may be detected in the stomach;<a id='r1785' /><a href='#f1785' class='c013'><sup>[1785]</sup></a> and in
the last edition of his Toxicology, Orfila has overrated the facility and
frequency with which an analysis may be conducted successfully.
[See p. <a href='#Page_538'>538</a>.]</p>

<p class='c006'>At the same time there is no doubt that the poison may sometimes
be found in the stomach. In Knape and Hecker’s Register there is
the case of a girl who died about eight hours after taking half an ounce
of laudanum; and the reporters found that an extract prepared from
the contents of the stomach caused deep sleep in frogs, chickens, and
dogs, and threw some of them into a comatose state, which proved
fatal.<a id='r1786' /><a href='#f1786' class='c013'><sup>[1786]</sup></a> Wildberg has related a very interesting case of a young lady
of Berlin, who had been seduced, and finding herself pregnant, swallowed
about half an ounce of laudanum in the evening, and died during
the night. In this instance the contents of the stomach had a
narcotic odour, and their extract when given to a young dog caused
excessive sleep, reeling, palsy of the legs, convulsions, and death.<a id='r1787' /><a href='#f1787' class='c013'><sup>[1787]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>M. Petit has related another case fatal in about ten hours, where
the contents of the stomach had the smell of opium; and their alcoholic
extract had a bitter taste, and killed guinea-pigs, with symptoms
of narcotism.<a id='r1788' /><a href='#f1788' class='c013'><sup>[1788]</sup></a> In a case related by Mayer in Rust’s Magazin,
which also proved fatal after an interval of ten hours, the poison, which
in this instance was the saffron-tincture, was distinctly detected in the
stomach by a strong odour of opium and saffron.<a id='r1789' /><a href='#f1789' class='c013'><sup>[1789]</sup></a> In a case where
the patient lived between thirteen and fourteen hours, that of the
individual for whose murder Stewart and his wife were executed at
Edinburgh, Dr. Ure succeeded in detecting meconic acid in the contents
of the stomach, which had been removed by the pump about
three hours after the opium was swallowed.<a id='r1790' /><a href='#f1790' class='c013'><sup>[1790]</sup></a> In another case published
by Mr. Skae of this city, where death was caused by half an
ounce in thirteen hours, without any attempt having been made to
evacuate the stomach, the contents of that organ, treated according
to the process at p. <a href='#Page_534'>534</a>, yielded evident indications of morphia, and
obscure evidence of meconic acid.<a id='r1791' /><a href='#f1791' class='c013'><sup>[1791]</sup></a> Lastly, it may be added that in
Dr. Traill’s case of poisoning with ten grains of muriate of morphia,
when the contents of the stomach were decomposed by magnesia, a
solution was obtained from the precipitate by rectified spirit, which,
when concentrated, had the strong bitter taste of morphia, and became
yellow with nitric acid; and yet the individual survived no less than
twelve hours.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_566'>566</span>An important fact, ascertained by MM. Orfila and Lesueur, is that
neither opium nor the salts of morphia undergo decomposition by being
long in contact with decaying animal matter. Even after many
months they may be discovered; at least the putrefaction of the matter
with which they are mingled does not add any impediment in the
way of their discovery. It is only necessary to observe that the alkaloid
may be rendered insoluble by the evolution of ammonia, which
separates it from its state of combination.<a id='r1792' /><a href='#f1792' class='c013'><sup>[1792]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> IV.—<i>Of the Treatment of Poisoning with Opium.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The treatment of poisoning with opium, owing partly to the numerous
cases that have been published, and partly to the experiments of
Orfila on the supposed antidotes,—is now well understood.</p>

<p class='c006'>The primary object is to remove the poison from the stomach. This
is proper even in the rare cases in which vomiting occurs spontaneously.
It is by no means easy to remove all the opium by vomiting,
especially if it was taken in the solid state; for it becomes so intimately
mixed with the lining mucus of the villous coat, that it is never
thoroughly removed till the mucus is also removed, which is always
effected with difficulty.</p>

<p class='c006'>The removal of the poison is to be accomplished in one of three
ways, by emetics administered in the usual manner, by the stomach-pump,
or by the injection of emetics into the veins.</p>

<p class='c006'>By far the best emetic is the <i>sulphate of zinc</i> in the dose of half a
drachm or two scruples, which may be repeated after a short interval,
if the first dose fails to act. In order to insure its action it is of great
use to keep the patient roused as much as possible,—a point which
is often forgotten.—The <i>sulphate of copper</i> has been used by some
as an emetic; but it is not so certain as the sulphate of zinc. Besides,
as it is a much more virulent poison, it may prove injurious, if
retained long in the stomach. In Dr. Marcet’s case the patient, after
recovering from the lethargic symptoms, suffered much from pain in the
throat and stomach, occasioned probably by the sulphate of copper
which he took remaining some time undischarged. <i>Tartar emetic</i>,
from the uncertainty of its action when given in considerable doses,
is even worse adapted for such cases. This is illustrated by a case
in the seventh volume of the Medical and Surgical Journal, the same
which has already been referred to as exemplifying the occasional
occurrence of convulsions and delirium in poisoning with opium. A
scruple of tartar emetic was administered to cause vomiting, but to
no purpose. When it had remained fifteen minutes, sulphate of zinc
was also given, and with immediate effect. But the patient, after recovering
from the sopor, was attacked with pains in the stomach and
bowels, and with tenesmus, which lasted several days.</p>

<p class='c006'>Emetics should be preferred for evacuating the stomach, provided
the case be not urgent. Even then, however, they sometimes fail altogether.
The best practice in that case is to endeavour to remove
<span class='pageno' id='Page_567'>567</span>the poison with the stomach-pump; and this in urgent cases should
be the first remedy employed. The treatment by the stomach-pump
has now become so generally known, that it is unnecessary to describe
it particularly. It was recommended in this country by the late
Dr. Monro in his lectures; but does not appear to have been tried by
him. In 1803 it was first published by Renault in his treatise on the
counter-poisons of arsenic; and he had tried it on animals.<a id='r1793' /><a href='#f1793' class='c013'><sup>[1793]</sup></a> But the
first person who used it in an actual case of poisoning with opium was
Dr. Physick of Philadelphia. He saved the life of a child with it in
1812; and not long afterwards his countryman, Dr. Dorsey, cured
two other individuals.<a id='r1794' /><a href='#f1794' class='c013'><sup>[1794]</sup></a> More lately it was again proposed in London
by Mr. Jukes, who does not appear to have been acquainted with
these prior trials and experiments. Although he cannot be considered
in the light of a discoverer, the profession is much indebted to
him for having recalled their attention to this treatment, and for having
by his success and activity fairly established its reputation. An account
will be seen of his apparatus and of several cases in the Medical
and Physical Journal for September and November, 1822. In using
the stomach-pump care must be taken not to injure the stomach by too
forcible suction.—When it is not at hand, Mr. Bryce of this city
recommended the substitution of a long tube with a bladder attached.
After the stomach has been filled with warm water from the bladder,
the tube is to be turned down so as to act upon the contents of the
stomach as a syphon. Dr. Alison cured a patient in this way.<a id='r1795' /><a href='#f1795' class='c013'><sup>[1795]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Another method of removing opium from the stomach, which has
been practised successfully where the patient could not be made to
submit to the common treatment, is the injection of tartar-emetic
into the rectum. A case is related by Dr. Roe of New York where
this treatment proved successful. Fifteen grains in half a gallon of
water excited free vomiting, and ten grains more renewed it. Care
was taken to insure the discharge of the whole tartar-emetic by a
subsequent purgative injection.<a id='r1796' /><a href='#f1796' class='c013'><sup>[1796]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The last method for removing opium from the stomach is a desperate
one, which can only be recommended when emetics by the mouth
have utterly failed, and when a stomach-pump or Mr. Bryce’s substitute,
cannot be procured. It is the injection of an emetic into the
veins. Tartar-emetic answers best for this purpose, and its effect is
almost certain. A grain is the dose. While injecting it, care must
be taken by the operator not to introduce air into the vein.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next object in conducting the treatment of poisoning with
opium is to keep the patient constantly roused. This alone is sufficient
when the dose is not large, and the poison has been discharged
by vomiting; and in every case it forms, next to the evacuation of
the stomach, the most important of the treatment.</p>

<p class='c006'>The best method of keeping the patient roused is to drag him up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_568'>568</span>and down between two men, who must be cautioned against yielding
to his importunate entreaties and occasional struggles to get free and
rest himself. For the sopor returns so rapidly, that I have known a
patient answer two or three short questions quite correctly on being
allowed to stand still, and suddenly drop the head in a state of insensibility
while standing. The duration of the exercise should vary
according to circumstances from three, to six, or twelve hours.
When he is allowed at length to take out his sleep, the attendants
must ascertain that it is safe to do so by rousing him from time to
time; and if this should become difficult, he must be turned out of
bed again and exercised as before.</p>

<p class='c006'>It appears from some cases published not long ago by Mr. Wray<a id='r1797' /><a href='#f1797' class='c013'><sup>[1797]</sup></a>
and Dr. Copland,<a id='r1798' /><a href='#f1798' class='c013'><sup>[1798]</sup></a> and more lately also by Dr. Bright,<a id='r1799' /><a href='#f1799' class='c013'><sup>[1799]</sup></a> that the most
insensible may be roused to a state of almost complete consciousness
for a short time, by dashing cold water over the head and breast.
This treatment can never supersede the use of emetics: and as its effect
is but temporary, it ought not to supersede the plan of forced exercise.
But it appears to be an excellent way to insure the operation of
emetics. If the emetic is about to fail in its effect, cold water
dashed over the head restores the patient for a few moments to sensibility,
during the continuance of which the emetic operates.
Dashing cold water over the head may perhaps be dangerous in the
advanced stage, when the body is cold and the breathing imperceptible;
but the most desperate remedies may be then tried, as the
patient is generally in almost a hopeless state. In one of the cases
mentioned by Dr. Bright from the experience of Mr. Walne, complete
recovery was accomplished, mainly by cold affusion of the
head, where there appeared reason to believe that more than an
ounce and a half of laudanum had disappeared from the stomach
before evacuating remedies were used.—This treatment seems to
have been first proposed in 1767 by a German physician, Dr. Gräter.<a id='r1800' /><a href='#f1800' class='c013'><sup>[1800]</sup></a>
A suggestion, which is probably an improvement, has been recently
made by Dr. Boisragon of Cheltenham, to alternate the use of cold
with that of warm water, applied to children in the shape of warm
bath, and to adults in the form of warm-sponging and the foot-bath.
The alternating impression of heat and cold may act better as a stimulant
than either agent singly; and the occasional employment of
heat prevents the risk of collapse from too continuous exposure to
cold. Dr. Boisragon saved in this way two cases in very unpromising
circumstances.<a id='r1801' /><a href='#f1801' class='c013'><sup>[1801]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In some cases internal stimulants have been given with advantage,
such as assafœtida, ammonia, camphor, musk, &amp;c. It is always useful
to stimulate the nostrils from time to time, by tickling them or holding
ammonia under the nose; but the application should be neither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_569'>569</span>frequent nor long continued, as the ammonia may cause deleterious
effects when too freely inhaled. Pulling the hair and injecting
water into the ears are also powerful modes of rousing the patient.</p>

<p class='c006'>Venesection has been recommended and successfully used by some
physicians. If the stomach be emptied, and the patient kept roused,
as may almost always be done when means are resorted to in time,
venesection will be unnecessary. Sometimes, however, when the
pulse is full and strong, it may be prudent to withdraw blood; and
it certainly appears that in most cases where this remedy has been
employed the sensibility began to return almost immediately after.
This is very well shown in a case of poisoning with opium related
by Mr. Ross<a id='r1802' /><a href='#f1802' class='c013'><sup>[1802]</sup></a> in the Edinburgh Medical Journal, in another described
in the same journal by Mr. Richardson,<a id='r1803' /><a href='#f1803' class='c013'><sup>[1803]</sup></a> and also in two cases of
poisoning with acetate of morphia mentioned in a former page.
Sometimes, on the contrary, it has seemed injurious, probably because
it was not had recourse to till the patient was moribund. It is a
sound general rule that blood-letting ought not to be resorted to until
the poison is thoroughly removed from the stomach; for it favours
absorption. And yet facts are not wanting to show that this rule,
now generally admitted since the researches of Magendie on absorption,
is not infallible. Dr. Young of the United States has given
the particulars of a case where imperturbable coma was formed, together
with puffing stertorous respiration, in consequence of an ounce
of laudanum having been swallowed,—and where recovery took
place, without the poison having been removed at all, simply under
the employment of three blood-lettings to the amount of twenty-eight
ounces altogether, of cold to the head, and of sinapisms to the legs.<a id='r1804' /><a href='#f1804' class='c013'><sup>[1804]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Galvanism has been sometimes resorted to, but seldom with decided
advantage. I saw it tried, with dubious utility, a few years ago
in an urgent case which was treated in the Edinburgh Infirmary.
Six ounces of laudanum had been swallowed, but most of it was removed
in three-quarters of an hour by the stomach-pump. A stage
of deep sopor followed, after which sensibility was restored, and
maintained for four hours by forced exercise. A state of pure and
extreme coma then ensued, during which galvanism was for some
time of great service, in rousing the patient. Gradually, however,
it ceased to have any effect of the kind. Recovery took place eventually
under the use of external and internal stimuli. Mr. Erichsen
of the University-College Hospital, London, has related a case, in
which electro-magnetism was of undoubted service. The usual
symptoms had been occasioned by an ounce of laudanum. The
poison had been withdrawn by the stomach-pump, when unavailing
attempts were made to restore sensibility by means of various stimulants.
At length several electro-magnetic shocks were passed
from the forehead to the upper part of the spine, with the effect of
speedily eliciting signs of consciousness; in twenty minutes the patient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_570'>570</span>could answer questions and walk a little; and eventually complete
recovery took place.<a id='r1805' /><a href='#f1805' class='c013'><sup>[1805]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In desperate circumstances artificial respiration may be used with
propriety. After the breathing has been almost or entirely suspended
the heart continues to beat for some time; and so long as its contractions
continue, there is some hope that life may be preserved.
But it is essential for the continuance of the heart’s action, that the
breathing be speedily restored to a state of much greater perfection
than that which attends the close of poisoning with opium. It is not
improbable that the only ultimate cause of death from opium is
suspension of the respiration, and that if it could be maintained
artificially so as to resemble exactly natural breathing, the poison in
the blood would be at length decomposed and consciousness gradually
restored. The following is an interesting example by Mr.
Whately, in which artificial respiration proved successful. A middle-aged
man swallowed half an ounce of crude opium and soon became
lethargic. He was roused from this state by appropriate remedies,
and his surgeon left him. But the poison not having been sufficiently
discharged, he fell again into a state of stupor; and when the surgeon
returned, he found the face pale, cold and deadly, the lips
black, the eyelids motionless, so as to remain in any position in
which they were placed, the pulse very small and irregular, and the
respiration quite extinct. The chest was immediately inflated by
artificial means, and when this had been persevered in for seven
minutes, expiration became accompanied with a croak, which gradually
increased in strength till natural breathing was established.
Emetics were then given, and the patient eventually recovered.<a id='r1806' /><a href='#f1806' class='c013'><sup>[1806]</sup></a>—Dr.
Ware of Boston (U. S.) has more lately described another case,
where artificial respiration was employed with marked advantage,
and would probably have saved the patient’s life in very unfavourable
circumstances, but for the disease on account of which the opium
was given.<a id='r1807' /><a href='#f1807' class='c013'><sup>[1807]</sup></a>—Another has been lately described by Mr. C. J. Smith
of Madras. The patient was not seen for four hours, and received
no benefit from the ordinary remedies during the next hour and a
half. Artificial respiration was then resorted to and maintained for
nearly five hours with an hour of interval; and this measure certainly
seems to have brought the case to a favourable termination under
most unpromising circumstances.<a id='r1808' /><a href='#f1808' class='c013'><sup>[1808]</sup></a>—Dr. Watson of Glasgow has
mentioned to me the particulars of an instructive base in the person
of an infant three weeks old, in whom, after the breathing had stopped
and the heart had nearly ceased to beat, the occasional inflation of
the chest with the breath at intervals of two or three minutes restored
for a time the action both of the heart and lungs, and eventually
accomplished recovery. On physiological principles it appears probable,
that this simple mode of procedure may prove more frequently
successful than might at first be thought.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_571'>571</span>It would be a fruitless task to examine into the merits of the
numerous antidotes which have from time to time been proposed for
poisoning with opium. Professor Orfila has examined many of them
with great care, such as vinegar, tartaric acid, lemonade, infusion of
coffee, decoction of galls, solution of chlorine, camphor, diluents;
and he has found them all useless before the poison is expelled from
the stomach, with the single exception of decoction of galls. As
he remarked that this fluid throws down the active principles of an
infusion of opium, and subsequently found that such a mixture acts
more feebly on the animal system than the opiate infusion itself, he
thinks the decoction of galls may with propriety be used as an imperfect
antidote, till the poison can be evacuated from the stomach.<a id='r1809' /><a href='#f1809' class='c013'><sup>[1809]</sup></a>
His experiments, however, do not assign to it very material activity
as a remedy; and certainly the whole efforts of the physician ought in
the first instance to be directed to the removal of the opium, and to keeping
the patient roused. When the opium has been completely removed,
the vegetable acids and infusion of coffee have been found useful in reviving
the patient, and subsequently in subduing sickness, vomiting,
and headache; but till the poison is completely removed the administration
of acids is worse than useless, provided the opium was
given in the solid state, because its solution in the juices of the
stomach is accelerated. It has been maintained that iodine, chlorine,
and bromine are all antidotes for poisoning with the vegetable alkaloids.<a id='r1810' /><a href='#f1810' class='c013'><sup>[1810]</sup></a>
Some notice will be taken of this statement in the chapter
on Nux Vomica. It has also been lately alleged in the United States
that opium has no effect when given with acetate of lead; and an
hospital case is reported as having occurred at New York, where the
poison was swallowed in this way to the extent of thirty grains,
without any injurious effect.<a id='r1811' /><a href='#f1811' class='c013'><sup>[1811]</sup></a> There must have been some mistake
here, however. When given with acetate of lead in medicinal doses,
opium exerts its usual sedative and anodyne action; and indeed
there is no chemical or physiological reason why it should not do so.</p>

bears so close a resemblance to opium in its properties as the <i>hyoscyamus</i>
or henbane. Several species are poisonous; but the only one
that has been examined with care is the <i>H. niger</i>, from which the extract
of the apothecary is prepared.</p>

<p class='c006'>The hyoscyamus has been analyzed by various chemists, and found
to contain a peculiar alkaloid, in which the properties of the plant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_572'>572</span>are concentrated. It is named hyoscyamia. This substance in its pure
state, as first obtained by MM. Geiger and Hesse, is a solid body, in
fine silky crystals, without odour, of a strong acrid taste like tobacco,
partially volatilizable with boiling water, entirely volatilizable alone
at a somewhat higher heat, very soluble in alcohol and ether, but
sparingly so in water.<a id='r1812' /><a href='#f1812' class='c013'><sup>[1812]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Farther, hyoscyamus, like many other narcotic vegetables, stramonium,
digitalis, opium, tobacco, and hemlock, has been found by
Mr. Morries Stirling to yield by destructive distillation an empyreumatic
oil of great activity. Its poisonous properties, however,
are not essential to the oil, but reside in a volatile principle which
may be detached by weak acetic acid. The relation of this principle
to hyoscyamia has not been ascertained; but it is an active poison,
small doses producing in rabbits, convulsions, coma, and speedy
death.<a id='r1813' /><a href='#f1813' class='c013'><sup>[1813]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Runge proposes as evidence of poisoning with hyoscyamus, in
common, however, with stramonium and belladonna, to concentrate
a solution of the contents of the stomach, and apply it to a cat’s
eye to dilate the pupil. Dilatation, he says, was even produced by
an extract obtained from the urine of a rabbit which had been fed
some time on hyoscyamus.<a id='r1814' /><a href='#f1814' class='c013'><sup>[1814]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>According to the experiments of Professor Orfila, the juice or extract
procured from the leaves, stems, and especially the root, produces
in animals a state of sopor much purer than that caused by
opium. It is most active when injected into the jugular vein, less
so when applied to the cellular tissue, and still less when introduced
into the stomach. Except occasional paralysis of the heart, indicated
by florid blood in its left cavities, no morbid appearance is to be
found in the dead body. Six drachms of the pharmaceutic extract
of the leaves killed a dog in two hours and a quarter when swallowed;
and three drachms killed another in four hours through a
wound in the back. Its action appears to be exerted through the
medium of the blood-vessels, and is purely narcotic.<a id='r1815' /><a href='#f1815' class='c013'><sup>[1815]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It is probable that the activity of this plant is much affected by
season; and the energy of its preparations varies greatly with the
manner of obtaining them. The information, however, which is at
present possessed on these two points is vague, because the influence
of the two circumstances has seldom been viewed carefully
apart.</p>

<p class='c006'>The leaves, from which the pharmaceutic preparations of hyoscyamus
are obtained, are commonly held to be most active during
the inflorescence of the plant in the second summer of its existence.
On general principles this appears probable; but there are no satisfactory
experiments on the subject, even the late researches of Mr.
Houlton having left much still to be determined.<a id='r1816' /><a href='#f1816' class='c013'><sup>[1816]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_573'>573</span>Orfila has made some important remarks as to the effect of season
and vegetation on the energy of the root as a poison. The root he
maintains is the most active part of the plant; but in the spring it is
nearly inert. Thus the juice of three pounds of the root collected
near the end of April, when the plant has hardly begun to shoot,
killed a dog in somewhat less than two days; while a decoction of
an ounce and a half collected on the last day of June, when the
plant was in full vegetation, proved fatal in two hours and a half.</p>

<p class='c006'>The extract of the leaves, procured from different shops, was found
by Orfila to vary greatly in point of strength, some samples being
absolutely inert.<a id='r1817' /><a href='#f1817' class='c013'><sup>[1817]</sup></a> The causes of these differences have been ascertained
experimentally by Brandes to be, that the herb loses its
active principle in part by decomposition in the process of simple
desiccation, and also when long kept; and that the greater part is
also similarly decomposed in preparing an extract, unless the process
be finished quickly, and at a low heat.</p>

<p class='c006'>The seeds of hyoscyamus are poisonous, as well as the leaves and
root. Indeed the whole plant is so. The seeds contain much more
hyoscyamia than the leaves.</p>

<p class='c006'>The effects of hyoscyamus on man differ somewhat from those on
animals, and vary greatly with the dose.</p>

<p class='c006'>In medicinal doses it commonly induces pleasant sleep. This indeed
has been denied by M. Fouquier, who infers from his experiments
that it never causes sleep, but always headache, delirium,
nausea, vomiting, and feverishness.<a id='r1818' /><a href='#f1818' class='c013'><sup>[1818]</sup></a> I have certainly seen it sometimes
have these effects; but much more generally it has acted as a
pleasant hypnotic and anodyne.</p>

<p class='c006'>Its effect in large doses have been well described by M. Choquet
as they occurred in two soldiers who ate by mistake the young shoots
dressed with olive oil. They presently became giddy and stupid,
lost their speech, and had a dull, haggard look. The pupils were
excessively dilated, and the eyes so insensible that the eyelids did
not wink when the cornea was touched. The pulse was small and
intermitting, the breathing difficult, the jaw locked, and the mouth
distorted by <i>risus sardonicus</i>. Sensibility was extinct, the limbs
were cold and palsied, the arms convulsed, and there was that singular
union of delirium and coma which is usually termed typhomania.
One of the men soon vomited freely under the influence of
emetics, and in a short time got quite well. The other vomited little.
As the palsy and somnolency abated, the delirium became extravagant,
and the patient quite unmanageable till the evening of the subsequent
day, when the operation of brisk purgatives restored him to
his senses. In two days both were fit for duty.<a id='r1819' /><a href='#f1819' class='c013'><sup>[1819]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In a treatise on vegetable poisons, Mr. Wilmer has related the
history of six persons in a family, who were poisoned by eating at
dinner the roots of the hyoscyamus by mistake instead of parsneps.
Several were delirious and danced about the room like maniacs, one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_574'>574</span>appeared as if he had got drunk, and a woman became profoundly
and irrecoverably comatose. Emetics could not be introduced into
the stomach, stimulant clysters had no effect, external stimuli of every
kind failed to rouse her, and she expired next morning at six.<a id='r1820' /><a href='#f1820' class='c013'><sup>[1820]</sup></a> The
roots in this instance were gathered in the winter time,—a fact, which
does not quite coincide with the conclusions of Orfila, that the plant
must be in full vegetation before the energy of the root is considerable.</p>

<p class='c006'>From these and other cases, the abstracts of which are to be seen
in Orfila’s Toxicology, or in Wibmer’s Treatise on the Operation of
Medicines and Poisons, it follows that hyoscyamus in a poisonous
dose causes loss of speech, dilatation of the pupil, coma, and delirium,
commonly of the unmanageable, sometimes of the furious kind.
In general a stage of delirium precedes coma; and sometimes as the
coma passes off, delirium returns for a time. It has been known to
act powerfully in the form of clyster.<a id='r1821' /><a href='#f1821' class='c013'><sup>[1821]</sup></a> It has also been known to
act with considerable energy even through the sound skin, as appears
from a case which occurred to Wibmer. He was called to a lady
affected with great stupor, dilated pupils, flushed face, loss of speech,
full hard pulse, and swelling of the abdomen; and he found that
these symptoms were owing to several ounces of henbane leaves
having been applied to the belly in a poultice, on account of strangury
and tympanitis. She was still capable of being roused by speaking
loudly close to her ear; and under proper treatment she recovered.<a id='r1822' /><a href='#f1822' class='c013'><sup>[1822]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Henbane seldom causes any distinct symptoms of irritant poisoning.
In several, however, of the cases related by the older modern authors
some pain in the belly, a little vomiting, and more rarely diarrhœa,
appear to have occurred.<a id='r1823' /><a href='#f1823' class='c013'><sup>[1823]</sup></a> Plenck quotes, from a Swedish authority,
an instance of its having produced burning in the stomach, intense
thirst, watching, delirium, depraved vision, and next day a crowded
eruption of dark spots and vesicles, which disappeared on the supervention
of a profuse diarrhœa.<a id='r1824' /><a href='#f1824' class='c013'><sup>[1824]</sup></a> The same author alludes to cases
where it proved fatal; but this event is rare in the present day, obviously
because the precursory stage of delirium gives an opportunity
of removing the poison, before the stage of coma is formed. A
fatal case, which occurred to Mr. Wibmer, has been mentioned
above; and another has been related in Pyl’s Magazin. Two boys
a few minutes after eating the seeds were attacked with convulsions
and heat in the throat; and one of them, who could not be made to
vomit, died in the course of the ensuing night.<a id='r1825' /><a href='#f1825' class='c013'><sup>[1825]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The accidents it has occasioned have commonly arisen from the
individuals confounding the root with that of the wild chicory or with
the parsnep, the latter of which it somewhat resembles.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of the other species of the hyoscyamus, the <i>H. albus</i> has been
known to cause symptoms precisely the same with those above
<span class='pageno' id='Page_575'>575</span>described. Professor Foderé has given a good example of its effects
on man, as they occurred in the crew of a French corvette in the
Archipelago. The plant was boiled and distributed among the
whole ship’s company, as several of the sailors said they knew it to
be eatable and salubrious. But in no long time they were all seized
with giddiness, vomiting, convulsions, colic, purging, and delirium
of the active kind. They were all soon relieved by emetics and
purgatives.<a id='r1826' /><a href='#f1826' class='c013'><sup>[1826]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Archibald Hamilton has described a case of the same nature,
which was caused by the seeds of this plant. A young medical
student, who took about twenty-five grains of the seeds, was seized
in half an hour with lassitude and somnolency, and successively with
dryness of the throat, impeding deglutition, convulsive movements
of the arms, incoherency, total insensibility of the skin, and loss of
recollection. These symptoms continued about twelve hours, and
then slowly receded.<a id='r1827' /><a href='#f1827' class='c013'><sup>[1827]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Three other species, the <i>H. aureus</i>, <i>physaloides</i> and <i>scopolia</i> are
represented by Orfila to be equally deleterious.</p>

<p class='c006'>The alkaloid hyoscyamus possesses in an intense degree the active
properties of the plant. It has not been hitherto examined in this
respect with much care. But extremely minute quantities produce
excessive enlargement of the pupil, when put within the eyelids in
the form of neutral salt.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Treatment.</i>—The treatment of poisoning with hyoscyamus consists
in removing the poison, diminishing cerebral congestion, and restoring
sensibility. It is therefore substantially the same as in poisoning
with opium, except that general or local evacuation of blood is
more frequently required, in consequence of the greater tendency of
hyoscyamus to induce determination of blood towards the head and
congestion there. It has been lately alleged by an Italian author that
a large dose of lemon-juice is an immediate antidote for the effects of
too large a medicinal dose, even when the poison was administered
in the form of injection.<a id='r1828' /><a href='#f1828' class='c013'><sup>[1828]</sup></a> This does not seem probable.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Lactuca.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Allied in its effects, but greatly inferior in power to opium and
hyoscyamus, is the <i>Lactuca virosa</i>, together with the <i>Lettuce-opium</i>,
or inspissated juice of <i>L. sativa</i>, and <i>L. virosa</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila found that three drachms of the extract of <i>L. virosa</i> introduced
into the stomach of a dog killed it in two days, without causing
any remarkable symptom; that two drachms applied to a wound in
the back induced giddiness, slight sopor, and death in three days;
and that thirty-six grains injected in a state of solution into the jugular
vein caused dulness, weakness, slight convulsions, and death in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_576'>576</span>eighteen minutes.<a id='r1829' /><a href='#f1829' class='c013'><sup>[1829]</sup></a> This poison, therefore, like other narcotics, acts
through absorption. But it is far from being energetic. The extract
is very uncertain in strength,—as may indeed be inferred from the
variable nature of the processes by which it is prepared.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lactucarium, the inspissated juice, especially that obtained from
<i>L. virosa</i>, is obviously a more active preparation than the extract.
Doses of no great magnitude kill small animals. But there is a want
of good observations on its effects and energy as a poison.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Solanum.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Different species of <i>solanum</i>, a genus of the same natural order
with the hyoscyamus, have been considered by Orfila to possess the
same properties, though in a much feebler degree. The <i>S. dulcamara</i>
or bittersweet has been erroneously believed by some to possess
distinct narcotic properties.<a id='r1830' /><a href='#f1830' class='c013'><sup>[1830]</sup></a> M. Dunal found that a dog might
take 180 of the berries or four ounces of the extract without any
inconvenience, and quotes an experiment on the human subject where
thirty-two drachms of extract were taken in two doses also without
injury.<a id='r1831' /><a href='#f1831' class='c013'><sup>[1831]</sup></a> If it has any power at all, therefore, it must possess too
little to be entitled to the name of a poison. Chevallier says he knew
an instance of a druggist’s apprentice being attacked with deep
somnolency for ten hours after carrying a large bundle of it on his
head;<a id='r1832' /><a href='#f1832' class='c013'><sup>[1832]</sup></a> but some other cause may be justly suspected to have here
been in operation. The <i>S. nigrum</i> or common nightshade has been
made the subject of experiment by Orfila, who found its extract to
possess nearly the power and energy of lettuce-opium.<a id='r1833' /><a href='#f1833' class='c013'><sup>[1833]</sup></a> The following
seems a genuine case of poisoning with the berries of this species.
Three children near Nantes in France were seized with severe
headache, giddiness, colic, nausea, and vomiting. One of them then
had excessive dilatation of the pupils, sweating and urgent thirst;
loss of voice, stertorous breathing, and tetanic spasms ensued; and
in twelve hours he died. Another had swelling of the face, alternate
contraction and dilatation of the pupils, repeated vomiting, and
eventually coma; but he recovered. The third was similarly, but
more slightly affected, and also recovered. The children who recovered
pointed out the berries they had eaten; which were found to
be those of <i>S. nigrum</i>.<a id='r1834' /><a href='#f1834' class='c013'><sup>[1834]</sup></a> The <i>S. fuscatum</i> is rather more active,
fifteen berries having caused hurried breathing and vomiting.<a id='r1835' /><a href='#f1835' class='c013'><sup>[1835]</sup></a> The
<i>S. mammosum</i> is also probably an active species, the capsule of the
berries having been known to excite vomiting, giddiness, and confusion
of mind.<a id='r1836' /><a href='#f1836' class='c013'><sup>[1836]</sup></a> In the <i>S. nigrum</i> and <i>dulcamara</i>, M. Desfosses discovered
in 1821 a peculiar alkaloid, which induces somnolency in
animals, but is not a very active poison.<a id='r1837' /><a href='#f1837' class='c013'><sup>[1837]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_577'>577</span>It has been supposed by some that the tubers of <i>Solanum tuberosum</i>,
the common potato, may acquire in certain circumstances poisonous
qualities of no mean energy. Dr. Kabler of Prague has described
the cases of four individuals in a family who were seized with alarming
narcotic symptoms after eating potatoes which had begun to germinate
and shrivel. The father of the family, who had eaten least
of them all, appeared as if tipsy, and soon became insensible. The
mother and two children became comatose and convulsed. All had
vomited before becoming insensible. They recovered under the
use of ether, frictions, and coffee; and in two hours were out of
danger.<a id='r1838' /><a href='#f1838' class='c013'><sup>[1838]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>An alkaloid has been indicated by several chemists in various species
of solanum. The most recent account, that of Otto, represents
it to be a pearly, white, pulverulent substance, alkaline in reaction,
and capable of uniting with acids. One grain of sulphate of solania
killed a rabbit in six hours, and three grains a stronger rabbit in nine
hours,—the symptoms being those of narcotic poisoning.<a id='r1839' /><a href='#f1839' class='c013'><sup>[1839]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Violent effects have often been assigned to the genus Solanum,
in consequence of its similarity to a powerful poison, the <i>Atropa
belladonna</i>; which indeed is described by the older authors under
the name of <i>Solanum furiosum</i>. It will be noticed among the Narcotico-acrid
Poisons.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXIX.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING WITH HYDROCYANIC ACID.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>The poisons, whose energy depends on the presence of the prussic
or hydrocyanic acid, are of great interest to the physiologist as
well as the medical jurist. Some of them are natural productions,
derived from the leaves, bark, fruit-kernels, and roots of certain
plants; others are formed artificially by complex chemical processes.
The species to be here noticed are the <i>hydrocyanic acid</i> itself, and
the essential oils and distilled waters of the <i>bitter almond</i>, <i>cherry-laurel</i>,
<i>peach-blossom</i>, <i>cluster-cherry</i>, <i>mountain-ash</i>, and <i>bitter cassava</i>.
These poisons have for some time attracted great attention
on account of their extraordinary power. And indeed in rapidity
of action, or the minuteness of the quantity in which they operate,
no poison surpasses and very few equal them. They are exceedingly
interesting to the medical jurist, because, as they are now
generally known, their effects often become the subject of medico-legal
investigation: they have been repeatedly taken by accident;
they have often been resorted to for committing suicide; and they
have likewise been employed as the instruments of murder. A
remarkable instance occurred in England towards the close of last
century, where murder was committed with the cherry-laurel water;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_578'>578</span>and two cases have been tried in England where death arose from
hydrocyanic acid, and the prisoners were charged with administering
it, but were found not guilty. These cases will be noticed presently.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of the Hydrocyanic Acid.</i><br /> <span class='sc'>Section</span> I.—<i>Of its Chemical History and Tests.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>This singular substance was discovered some time ago by Scheele;
but Gay-Lussac was the first who obtained it in a state of purity. It
is familiarly known to chemists under two forms,—as a pure acid,
and diluted with water.</p>

<p class='c006'>The pure acid is liquid, limpid, and colourless. It has an acrid,
pungent taste, and a very peculiar odour, which, when diffused
through the air, has a very distant resemblance to that of bitter
almonds, but is accompanied with a peculiar impression of acridity
on the nostrils and back of the throat. It is an error, however, to
suppose, as is very generally done, that the odour is the same with
that of the almond. It boils at 80°; freezes at 5°; and is very inflammable.
I have kept it unchanged for a fortnight in ice-cold
water; but at ordinary temperatures it decomposes spontaneously,
and becomes brown, sometimes in an hour, and commonly within
twelve hours. On this account it is extremely improbable that a
case will ever happen, in which the medical jurist will have to examine
it in its concentrated form.</p>

<p class='c006'>When united with water it forms the acid discovered by Scheele,
and now kept in the druggist’s shop. In this state it has the same
appearance, taste, and smell as the pure acid; but it is less volatile,
does not burn, and may be preserved long without change, if excluded
from the light. In consequence of its volatility, however, it becomes
weak, unless kept with great care; many samples of it also undergo
decomposition, and deposit brown flakes, if not excluded from the
light; and hence the acid of the shops is very variable in point of
strength. The acid prepared by decomposing the solution of the
ferro-cyanate of potass by sulphuric acid may be kept for years, even
exposed to diffuse light, without being decomposed at all. A French
physician made some experiments not long ago on the uncertainty of
the strength of the medicinal acid; and he found that he could swallow
a whole ounce of one sample, and a drachm of a stronger sample,
without sustaining any injury; but on trying some which had
been recently prepared by Vauquelin, he was immediately taken ill,
as will be related presently, and narrowly escaped with his life.<a id='r1840' /><a href='#f1840' class='c013'><sup>[1840]</sup></a>—The
acid of commerce differs much in strength, according to the process
by which it has been prepared, and independently of decomposition
by keeping. The medicinal acid long used in this country is
intended to be an imitation of that of Vauquelin, which contains
3·3 per cent.;<a id='r1841' /><a href='#f1841' class='c013'><sup>[1841]</sup></a> but the London College of Physicians, in adopting it
in their last Pharmacopœia, improperly altered the strength to 2 per
<span class='pageno' id='Page_579'>579</span>cent. That of Giese, which keeps well, is of the same strength as
the first; that of Schrader contains only one per cent.; that of Göbel
2·5 per cent.; that of Ittner 10 per cent.;<a id='r1842' /><a href='#f1842' class='c013'><sup>[1842]</sup></a> that of Robiquet 50 per
cent.<a id='r1843' /><a href='#f1843' class='c013'><sup>[1843]</sup></a> Of the alcoholic solutions the best known are that of Schrader,
which contains about 1·5 per cent. of pure acid,—that of the
Bavarian Pharmacopœia, which contains 4 per cent.,—that of Duflos,
9 per cent.,—that of Pfaff, 10 per cent.,—and that of Keller, 25 per
cent.<a href='#f1842' class='c013'><sup>[1842]</sup></a> These statements are necessary for understanding the cases
of poisoning published in foreign works.</p>

<p class='c006'>The tests for hydrocyanic acid has been examined by M. Lassaigne
of Paris, by Dr. Turner of London, and by Professor Orfila.
They are its odour, the salts of copper, the salts of iron, and nitrate
of silver.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>peculiar odour</i> of the acid is a very characteristic and delicate
test of its presence. According to Orfila, the smell is perceptible
when no chemical reagent is delicate enough to detect it.<a id='r1844' /><a href='#f1844' class='c013'><sup>[1844]</sup></a> But I
doubt the accuracy of this statement, and may farther observe, that
I have known some persons nearly insensible of any smell, even in
a specimen which was tolerably strong. Hence, when the odour is
resorted to as a test, it ought to be tried by several persons.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Sulphate of copper</i> forms with hydrocyanic acid, when rendered
alkaline with a little potass, a greenish precipitate, which becomes
nearly white, on the addition of a little hydrochloric acid. The
purpose of the hydrochloric acid is to redissolve some oxide of copper
thrown down by the potass. The precipitate is then the cyanide
of copper. This test, according to Lassaigne, will act on the poison
when dissolved in 20,000 parts of water. But as the precipitate is
not coloured, the test is an insignificant one compared with the next.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the acid be rendered alkaline by potass, the <i>salts of the mixed
peroxide and protoxide of iron</i> produce a grayish-green precipitate,
which, on the addition of a little sulphuric acid, becomes of a deep
prussian blue colour. Common green vitriol answers very well for
this purpose. The salts of the peroxide of iron will also often answer,
because, unless carefully prepared, they are never altogether free of
protoxide. But the salts of the pure peroxide of iron have no such
effect. They cause with the potass a brownish precipitate, which is
redissolved on the addition of sulphuric acid, leaving the solution
limpid. Mr. Ilott of Bromley has pointed out to me, that the iron
test does not act on a weak solution of hydrocyanic acid, if there be
an excess of ammonia present, either such from the first, or disengaged
by potash from muriate of ammonia; that the blue precipitate
is produced by driving off the ammonia with heat; but not by neutralizing
it with an acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>nitrate of silver</i> is a delicate and characteristic reagent for
hydrocyanic acid. A white precipitate, the cyanide of silver, is
produced in a very diluted solution; and this precipitate is distinguished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_580'>580</span>from the other white salts of silver, by being insoluble in
nitric acid at ordinary temperatures, but soluble in that acid at its
boiling temperature. In this action it is necessary to observe that
something more is accomplished than simple solution; the cyanide
is decomposed, nitrate of silver is formed, and hydrocyanic acid is
disengaged by the ebullition. A more characteristic property is,
that the precipitate when dried and heated emits cyanogen gas;
which is easily known by the beautiful rose-red colour of its flame.<a id='r1845' /><a href='#f1845' class='c013'><sup>[1845]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Sometimes it is necessary to determine the strength of diluted
hydrocyanic acid; because, on account of its tendency to decomposition,
doubts may be entertained whether a mixture which contains
it is strong enough to be dangerously poisonous. According to
Orfila, the best method of ascertaining the strength either of a pure
solution or of a mixture in syrup, is to throw down the acid with the
nitrate of silver and dry the precipitate; a hundred parts of which
correspond to 20·33 of pure hydrocyanic acid.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Process for Mixed Fluids.</i>—Some important observations have
been made by MM. Leuret and Lassaigne on the effect of mixing
animal matters with hydrocyanic acid. The most material of their
results are, that if the body of an animal poisoned with the acid is
left unburied for three days, the poison can no longer be detected;
and that if it is buried within twenty-four hours the poison may be
found after a longer interval, but never after eight days. The reason
is either that the acid volatilizes, or that it is decomposed. The
possibility thus indicated of detecting the poison in the body some
days after death has been since confirmed by actual examination in
a medico-legal case. In a case of poisoning with hydrocyanic acid,
followed by dismemberment of the body for the purpose of concealment,
distinct proof of the presence of the poison seven days after
death was obtained by the second of the succeeding processes, although
the trunk of the body had never been buried, but had been
for some time lying in a drain.<a id='r1846' /><a href='#f1846' class='c013'><sup>[1846]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>For detecting the poison in mixed fluids Orfila has lately advised
the following process. The fluid may be treated with animal charcoal
without heat. The colour being thus generally destroyed, the
test will sometimes act as usual. Or, without this preparation, a slip
of bibulous paper moistened with pure potass, may be immersed in
the suspected fluid for a few minutes, and then touched with a solution
of sulphate of iron: upon which the usual blue colour will be
produced on the paper. If neither of these methods should answer,
the fluid is to be distilled.<a id='r1847' /><a href='#f1847' class='c013'><sup>[1847]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Distillation of the fluid is on the whole the best mode of procedure.
It was proposed some time before by Lassaigne and Leuret for detecting
the poison in the stomach after death. The steps of their
process, which appears to me the best yet proposed, are as follows.
The contents after filtration are to be neutralized with sulphuric acid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_581'>581</span>if they are alkaline, in order to fix the ammonia which may have been
disengaged by putrefaction; the product is then to be distilled from
a vapour-bath till an eighth part has passed over into the receiver;
and the distilled fluid is to be tested with the sulphate of iron in the
usual way.<a id='r1848' /><a href='#f1848' class='c013'><sup>[1848]</sup></a> Orfila maintains that from hydrocyanized syrup only
two-thirds of the acid can be distilled over; and cautions the analyst
against estimating quantity by such means.<a id='r1849' /><a href='#f1849' class='c013'><sup>[1849]</sup></a> M. Ossian Henry has
proposed to condense the acid in distillation by a much more complex
process, which consists in obtaining it in the first instance in
the form of cyanide of silver.<a id='r1850' /><a href='#f1850' class='c013'><sup>[1850]</sup></a> But with a good refrigeratory there
is no difficulty in condensing every particle of acid with no other aid
than cold water.</p>

<p class='c006'>By this process Lassaigne could detect the poison in a cat or dog
killed by twelve drops and examined twenty-four or forty-eight
hours after death.<a id='r1851' /><a href='#f1851' class='c013'><sup>[1851]</sup></a> But Dr. Schubarth has objected to it,—and the
same objection will apply to every process in which heat is used,—that
hydrocyanic acid may be formed during distillation by the decomposition
of animal matter.<a id='r1852' /><a href='#f1852' class='c013'><sup>[1852]</sup></a> His objection, however, appears
only to rest on conjecture or presumption at farthest; and I doubt
whether, supposing the distillation to go on slowly in the vapour-bath,
the heat is sufficient to bring about the requisite decomposition.
The force of the objection must be decided by future researches.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is worthy of remark that hydrocyanic acid is apt to be formed in
the course of the changes produced by various agents in organic
matters. These are probably more numerous than the toxicologist is
at present exactly aware of. An instance of its formation in the
course of the decay of unsound cheese has been ascertained lately by
Dr. Witling;<a id='r1853' /><a href='#f1853' class='c013'><sup>[1853]</sup></a> and another example will be mentioned under the
head of spurred rye.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Cyanide of Potassium.</i>—The only compound of hydrocyanic acid
which requires notice is the cyanide of potassium. This is, when
pure, a white salt, bitter, not decomposable by a red heat unless in
contact with air, very soluble in water, and sparingly so in rectified
spirit. Its watery solution restores the blue of reddened litmus, and
does not precipitate lime-water: the mixed sulphates of the two
oxides of iron form with it Prussian blue: nitrate of silver causes a
white precipitate insoluble in cold nitric acid, but disappearing when
the acid is boiled: sulphate of copper causes an apple-green precipitate,
which becomes white on the addition of hydrochloric acid:
chloride of platinum or perchloric acid will indicate the potash. In
a complex organic mixture it is difficult to detect the potash; but
hydrocyanic acid may be obtained from it by distilling the suspected
fluid with tartaric acid.<a id='r1854' /><a href='#f1854' class='c013'><sup>[1854]</sup></a></p>

  <h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section</span> II.—<i>Of the Action of Hydrocyanic Acid and the Symptoms it excites in Man.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The effects of hydrocyanic acid on the animal system have been
examined by several physiologists. The best experiments with the
concentrated acid are those of M. Magendie; who says that, if a
single drop be put into the throat of a dog, the animal makes two or
three deep hurried respirations, and instantly drops down dead; that
it causes death almost as instantaneously when dropped under the
eyelid; and that when it is injected into the jugular vein, the animal
drops down dead at the very instant, as if struck with a cannon ball
or with lightning.<a id='r1855' /><a href='#f1855' class='c013'><sup>[1855]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>On repeating these experiments in order to determine less figuratively
the shortest period which elapses before the poison begins to
operate, as well as the shortest time in which it proves fatal,—two
points it will presently be found important to know,—I remarked
that a single drop, weighing scarcely a third of a grain, dropped into
the mouth of a rabbit, killed it in eighty-three seconds, and began to
act in sixty-three seconds,—that three drops weighing four-fifths of
a grain, in like manner killed a strong cat in thirty seconds, and
began to act in ten,—that another was affected by the same dose
in five and died in forty seconds,—that four drops weighing a
grain and a fifth did not affect a rabbit for twenty seconds, but killed
it in ten seconds more,—and that twenty-five grains, corresponding
with an ounce and a half of medicinal acid, began to act on a rabbit
as soon as it was poured into its mouth, and killed it outright in ten
seconds at farthest. Three drops injected into the eye acted on a
cat in twenty seconds, and killed it in twenty more; and the same
quantity dropped on a fresh wound in the loins acted in forty-five
and proved fatal in 105 seconds. Dr. A. T. Thomson says he has
seen the concentrated acid kill a strong dog in two seconds.<a id='r1856' /><a href='#f1856' class='c013'><sup>[1856]</sup></a> Mr.
Blake on the other hand alleges that all the accounts which represent
the action of the poison to begin in less than ten seconds are
exaggerated, because he could never find it to act more quickly,
even when thirty minims of concentrated acid were injected at once
into the femoral vein.<a id='r1857' /><a href='#f1857' class='c013'><sup>[1857]</sup></a> But it is impossible that any negative results
can outweigh positive observations, especially when made, as
mine were, expressly with the view of ascertaining the shortest interval.
In the slower cases enumerated above there were regular fits of
violent tetanus; but in the very rapid cases the animals perished just
as the fit was ushered in with retraction of the head. In rabbits opisthotonos,
in cats emprosthotonos, was the chief tetanic symptom.—The
practical application of these experiments will appear presently.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of all the forms in which the pure acid can be administered, that
of vapour appears the most instantaneous in operation. M. Robert
found, that when a bird, a rabbit, a cat, and two dogs were made to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_583'>583</span>breathe air saturated with its vapour, the first died in one second,
the second also in a single second, the cat in two, one dog in five,
and the other dog in ten seconds.<a id='r1858' /><a href='#f1858' class='c013'><sup>[1858]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The effects of the diluted acid are the same when the dose is large,
but somewhat different when inferior doses are given. These effects
have been observed by many physiologists; but the most accurate
and extensive experiments are those of Emmert published in 1805,<a id='r1859' /><a href='#f1859' class='c013'><sup>[1859]</sup></a>
those of Coullon in 1819,<a id='r1860' /><a href='#f1860' class='c013'><sup>[1860]</sup></a> and those of Krimer in 1827.<a id='r1861' /><a href='#f1861' class='c013'><sup>[1861]</sup></a> They
found that when an animal is poisoned with a dose not quite sufficient
to cause death, it is seized in one or two minutes with giddiness,
weakness and salivation, then with tetanic convulsions, and at last
with gradually increasing insensibility; that after lying in this state
for some time, the insensibility goes off rapidly and is succeeded by
a few attacks of convulsions and transient giddiness; and that the
whole duration of such cases of poisoning sometimes does not exceed
half an hour, but may extend to a whole day or more.—When the
dose is somewhat larger the animal perishes either in tetanic convulsions
or comatose; and death for the most part takes place between
the second and fifteenth minute. I have seen the diluted acid,
however, prove fatal with a rapidity scarcely surpassed by the pure
poison. Thus in an experiment with Vauquelin’s acid, made on a
strong cat at the same time with the second and third of the experiments
with the pure acid detailed above, I found that thirty-two
grains, which contain one of real acid, began to act in fifteen seconds,
and proved fatal in twenty-five more. According to Schubarth’s experiments
death may be sometimes delayed for thirty-two minutes;<a id='r1862' /><a href='#f1862' class='c013'><sup>[1862]</sup></a>
but if the animal survives that interval, it recovers. He farther
states, that during the course of the symptoms the breath exhales an
odour of hydrocyanic acid.<a id='r1863' /><a href='#f1863' class='c013'><sup>[1863]</sup></a> Coullon once saw a dog die after nineteen
hours of suffering; but cases of this duration are exceedingly
rare.<a id='r1864' /><a href='#f1864' class='c013'><sup>[1864]</sup></a> When the dose is very large Mr. Macaulay, as will afterwards
be mentioned (p. <a href='#Page_590'>590</a>), has found death take place in a few
seconds, exactly as when the pure acid is given.</p>

<p class='c006'>The body presents few morbid appearances of note. The brain is
generally natural. Yet occasionally its vessels are turgid; and Schubarth
once found even an extravasation of blood between its external
membranes in the horse.<a id='r1865' /><a href='#f1865' class='c013'><sup>[1865]</sup></a> The heart and great vessels are distended
with black blood, which is commonly fluid, but occasionally coagulated
as usual. The lungs, according to Schubarth, are sometimes
pale, but much more generally injected and gorged with blood.<a id='r1866' /><a href='#f1866' class='c013'><sup>[1866]</sup></a>
The pure acid, according to Magendie, exhausts the irritability of the
heart and voluntary muscles so completely, that they are insensible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_584'>584</span>even to the stimulus of galvanism.<a id='r1867' /><a href='#f1867' class='c013'><sup>[1867]</sup></a> The diluted acid has not always
this effect. In the experiments of Coullon the heart and intestines
contracted, and the voluntary muscles continued contractile, after
death as usual.<a id='r1868' /><a href='#f1868' class='c013'><sup>[1868]</sup></a> So too Mr. Blake remarked both by inspection
of the body after death, and by means of the hæmadynamometer during
life, that, when the poison is introduced directly into a vein, so
as to prove fatal in forty-five seconds, the contractions of the heart,
though irregular, are not materially impaired in energy.<a id='r1869' /><a href='#f1869' class='c013'><sup>[1869]</sup></a> On the
other hand Schubarth states that the heart is never contractile, although
the intestines and voluntary muscles retain their contractility.<a id='r1870' /><a href='#f1870' class='c013'><sup>[1870]</sup></a>
The reason of these discrepant statements is that, as I have had occasion
to observe, a considerable difference really prevails in experiments
conducted under circumstances apparently the same. In eight
experiments on cats and rabbits with the pure acid the heart contracted
spontaneously, as well as under stimuli, for some time after
death, except in the instance of the rabbit killed with twenty-five
grains, and one of the cats killed by three drops applied to the
tongue. In the last two the pulsations of the heart ceased with the
short fit of tetanus which preceded death; and in the rabbit, whose
chest was laid open instantly after death, the heart was gorged and
its irritability utterly extinct. The later researches of Dr. Lonsdale
likewise show great varieties in the condition of the heart; and he
has been led to conclude that the diluted acid does not perceptibly
influence the heart, while the pure acid enfeebles it, if introduced into
the stomach, but arrests it, if injected into the windpipe.<a id='r1871' /><a href='#f1871' class='c013'><sup>[1871]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The experiments of Emmert, Coullon, and Krimer show that the
diluted acid acts most energetically through the serous membranes,
and next upon the stomach; that it also acts with energy on the cellular
tissue; that it has no effect when applied to the trunks or cut
extremities of nerves, or to a fissure made in the brain or spinal marrow;
that its action is prevented when the vessels of any part are
tied before the part is touched with the poison; that its action is not
prevented by previously dividing the nerves; and that it may sometimes
be discovered in the blood after death by chemical analysis,<a id='r1872' /><a href='#f1872' class='c013'><sup>[1872]</sup></a>
and frequently by the smell when analysis cannot succeed in separating
it.<a id='r1873' /><a href='#f1873' class='c013'><sup>[1873]</sup></a> These results favour the supposition that hydrocyanic acid
acts through the medium of the blood-vessels. But the extreme
rapidity of its operation in large doses is usually considered incompatible
with an action through the blood, or any other channel except
direct conveyance along the nerves. The tremendous rapidity of
action indicated by the experiments of Magendie, or of Mr. Macaulay
(p. <a href='#Page_543'>543</a>), of M. Robert, as well as in some of those performed
by myself,—certainly appears rather inconsistent with the notion,
that the acid must enter the blood-vessels before producing its effects.</p>

<p class='c006'>This acid acts on the brain and also on the spine independently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_585'>585</span>of its action on the brain. Its action on both is clearly indicated by
the combination of coma with tetanus. The independent action on
the spine is well shown by the following experiment of Wedemeyer.
In a dog the spinal cord was divided at the top of the loins, so that
no movement took place when the hind-legs were pricked: hydrocyanic
acid being then introduced into a wound in the left hind-leg,
symptoms of poisoning commenced in one minute, and the hind-legs
were affected with convulsions as well as the fore-legs.<a id='r1874' /><a href='#f1874' class='c013'><sup>[1874]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Hydrocyanic acid affects all animals indiscriminately. From the
highest to the lowest in the scale of creation all are killed by it;
and all perish nearly in the same manner. Such is the result of a
very extensive series of experiments by Coullon.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is scarcely necessary to observe that hydrocyanic acid acts
energetically as a poison, through whatever channel it is introduced
into the body. Whether it be swallowed, or injected into the rectum,
or dropped into the eye, or applied to a fresh wound, or inhaled
in the form of vapour, its action is exerted with tremendous energy.
Perhaps it may even act through the sound skin. It has not, hitherto,
indeed, been found to affect animals in this way, evidently because
their skin is too thick and impermeable. But M. Robiquet informed
me that once, while he was making some experiments on
the tension of its vapour, his fingers, after being some time exposed
to it, became affected with numbness, which lasted several days; I
have repeatedly remarked the same effect when handling tubes which
contained the concentrated acid; and Emmert found that the essential
oil of bitter almond, applied to the uninjured skin of the back of
a rabbit, produced the usual symptoms and death: and that the peculiar
odour of the poison was quite distinct after death in the deep-seated
muscles of the back.<a id='r1875' /><a href='#f1875' class='c013'><sup>[1875]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>This substance is poisonous in all its chemical combinations.
Coullon remarked that two drops of the hydrocyanate of ammonia
killed a sparrow in two minutes.<a id='r1876' /><a href='#f1876' class='c013'><sup>[1876]</sup></a> Robiquet and Magendie found that
a hundredth part of a grain of the cyanide of potassium killed a
linnet in thirty seconds, and five grains a large pointer in fifteen
minutes;<a id='r1877' /><a href='#f1877' class='c013'><sup>[1877]</sup></a> Orfila has related an instance of death in the human subject
within an hour after the administration of six grains of cyanide
of potassium in an injection;<a id='r1878' /><a href='#f1878' class='c013'><sup>[1878]</sup></a> and in a recent experimental investigation
the same author found that this salt produces all the effects
of hydrocyanic acid.<a id='r1879' /><a href='#f1879' class='c013'><sup>[1879]</sup></a> Schubarth killed a dog in twenty minutes
with twenty drops of the diluted acid neutralized by ammonia,<a id='r1880' /><a href='#f1880' class='c013'><sup>[1880]</sup></a> and
another in three hours with twenty-five drops neutralized by potass.
These facts are a sufficient answer to a statement made by Mr. Murray
of London, to the effect, that a considerable dose of the acid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_586'>586</span>may be given without injury to a rabbit,<a id='r1881' /><a href='#f1881' class='c013'><sup>[1881]</sup></a> if previously rendered
alkaline by ammonia. But, nevertheless, as will be seen under the
head of the treatment, ammonia, as Mr. Murray stated, is a good
antidote when administered after the poison as a stimulant.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>ferro-cyanates</i>, or prussiates, do not possess deleterious properties.
These salts were at one time considered compounds of hydrocyanic
acid with a double oxidized base, oxide of iron being one.
Thus the prussiate of potass was considered a compound of hydrocyanic
acid with potass and oxide of iron. But since the investigations
of Mr. Porrett, it has been admitted that there is only one
base, potash; and that it is in union with a hydracid, called ferro-cyanic
acid, the radicle of which is a ternary body composed of
carbon, azote, and iron. The physiological effects of this substance,
which have been examined by many experimentalists, are favourable
to Porrett’s opinion; for although some have found it poisonous, all
agree in assigning it very feeble properties, and some have not been
able to discover in it any deleterious quality at all. Coullon observes
that Gazan killed a dog with two drachms, and Callies another
with three drachms of the salt met with in commerce.<a id='r1882' /><a href='#f1882' class='c013'><sup>[1882]</sup></a> Schubarth
found that half an ounce had not any material effect on dogs,
even when vomiting did not occur for half an hour;<a id='r1883' /><a href='#f1883' class='c013'><sup>[1883]</sup></a> and Callies,
who found the salt of commerce somewhat poisonous, also remarked,
that when it was carefully prepared, several ounces might
be given without harm.<a id='r1884' /><a href='#f1884' class='c013'><sup>[1884]</sup></a> D’Arcet once swallowed half a pound of a
solution without any injury.<a id='r1885' /><a href='#f1885' class='c013'><sup>[1885]</sup></a> Similar results were obtained previously
with smaller doses by Wollaston, Marcet,<a id='r1886' /><a href='#f1886' class='c013'><sup>[1886]</sup></a> and Emmert,<a id='r1887' /><a href='#f1887' class='c013'><sup>[1887]</sup></a> as
well as afterwards by Dr. Macneven,<a id='r1888' /><a href='#f1888' class='c013'><sup>[1888]</sup></a> and Schubarth,<a id='r1889' /><a href='#f1889' class='c013'><sup>[1889]</sup></a> who found
that a drachm or even two drachms might be taken with impunity
by man and the lower animals.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>sulpho-cyanic acid</i>, another substance analogous in chemical
nature to the ferro-cyanic, was once supposed like it to be a poison of
great activity, but this is doubtful. Professor Mayer of Bonn ascertained
that a drachm and a half of a moderately strong solution
of the acid sometimes killed a rabbit in ninety seconds when injected
into the windpipe, and that the same quantity of a solution of sulpho-cyanate
of potassa might occasion death in the course of four hours;
but that some rabbits took half an ounce of the former and three
drachms of the latter without material harm, both when administered
through the windpipe, when injected into the rectum,
and when introduced into the stomach by a gullet-tube. In the fatal
cases death took place under symptoms of oppressed breathing,
rarely attended with convulsions; and extensive traces of irritation
were found in the alimentary canal.<a id='r1890' /><a href='#f1890' class='c013'><sup>[1890]</sup></a> Dr. Westrumb of Hameln,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_587'>587</span>however, seems to have found it more active in the form of sulpho-cyanate
of potassa. Two scruples in an ounce of water produced
in a dog spasmodic breathing, convulsions, efforts to vomit, and
death in seven minutes; and forty grains killed another in less than
two hours. In the latter animal he detected the poison by the sulphate
of iron in the blood, lungs, liver, spleen and kidneys.<a id='r1891' /><a href='#f1891' class='c013'><sup>[1891]</sup></a> Some
experiments by Soemering would even make it out to be a poison of
very great energy; for half a drachm of concentrated sulpho-cyanic
acid given to a dog occasioned immediate death; and the same
quantity of sulpho-cyanate of potassa killed another in one minute.<a id='r1892' /><a href='#f1892' class='c013'><sup>[1892]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Cyanic and cyanous acids</i> are not poisonous, according to the experiments
of Hünefield;<a id='r1893' /><a href='#f1893' class='c013'><sup>[1893]</sup></a> but <i>cyanogen</i> is a powerful poison, as
will be mentioned under the head of the Narcotic Gases.</p>

<p class='c006'>The symptoms of hydrocyanic acid observed in man are very
similar to those witnessed in animals.</p>

<p class='c006'>Coullon has given a good account of the effects of small doses as
ascertained by experiment on himself. When he took from 20 to 86
drops of a diluted acid, he was attacked for a few minutes with
nausea, salivation, hurried pulse, weight and pain in the head, succeeded
by a feeling of anxiety, which lasted about six hours.<a id='r1894' /><a href='#f1894' class='c013'><sup>[1894]</sup></a> Such
symptoms are apt to be induced by too large medicinal doses. Another
remarkable symptom which has been sometimes observed during
its medicinal use is salivation with ulceration of the mouth.
Dr. Macleod thrice had occasion to remark this in patients who had
been using the drug for about a fortnight, and twice in one individual;
and Dr. Granville says he had also twice witnessed the same
effect.<a id='r1895' /><a href='#f1895' class='c013'><sup>[1895]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>As to the effects of fatal doses, it is probable that in man, as in
animals, two varieties exist. When the dose is very large, death
will in general take place suddenly, without convulsions. But for
obvious reasons the symptoms in such cases have not been hitherto
witnessed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The most complete account of the symptoms from fatal doses when
convulsions occur, is given in a case reported by Hufeland of a man,
who, when apprehended for theft, swallowed an ounce of alcoholized
acid, containing about forty grains of the pure acid. He was
observed immediately to stagger a few steps, and then to sink down
without a groan, apparently lifeless. A physician, who instantly saw
him, found the pulse gone and the breathing for some time imperceptible.
After a short interval he made so forcible an expiration
that the ribs seemed drawn almost to the spine. The legs and arms
then became cold, the eyes prominent, glistening, and quite insensible;
and after one or two more convulsive expirations he died, five
minutes after swallowing the poison.<a id='r1896' /><a href='#f1896' class='c013'><sup>[1896]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In Horn’s Journal is recorded another case which also proved fatal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_588'>588</span>in five minutes, with precisely the same symptoms.<a id='r1897' /><a href='#f1897' class='c013'><sup>[1897]</sup></a> A short notice
of what appears to have been a similar case is given in the Annales
de Chimie. The person was a chemist’s servant, who swallowed a
large quantity of the alcoholic solution by mistake for a liqueur, the
poison having been accidentally left on the table by her master, who
had been showing it as a curiosity to some friends. No account is
given of the symptoms, farther than that she died apoplectic in two
minutes.<a id='r1898' /><a href='#f1898' class='c013'><sup>[1898]</sup></a> To these cases may be also added a short notice of the
French physician’s case mentioned at the commencement of this chapter.
It will convey a good idea of the operation of the poison when
not quite sufficient to kill. Very soon after swallowing a tea-spoonful
of the diluted acid he felt confusion in the head, and soon fell
down insensible, with difficult breathing, a small pulse, a bloated
countenance, dilated insensible pupils, and locked jaw. Afterwards
he had several fits of tetanus, one of them extremely violent. In two
hours and a half he began to recover his intellects and rapidly
became sensible; but for some days he suffered much from ulceration
of the mouth and violent pulmonary catarrh, which had evidently
been excited by the ammonia given for the purpose of rousing him.
This gentleman had eructations with the odour of the acid three or
four hours after he took it; and during the earlier symptoms the same
odour was exhaled by his breath.<a id='r1899' /><a href='#f1899' class='c013'><sup>[1899]</sup></a> The hydrocyanic odour of the
breath is of course an important distinguishing character, which
would appear, from the observations of Dr. Lonsdale on animals,<a id='r1900' /><a href='#f1900' class='c013'><sup>[1900]</sup></a> to
occur more frequently than might be supposed from the silence observed
on the subject by the reporters of cases.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hydrocyanic acid is not considered a cumulative poison,—that is,
the continued use of frequent small doses is not believed to possess
the power recognised in iodine, mercury, and foxglove, of gradually
and silently accumulating in the body, and then suddenly breaking
out with dangerous or fatal violence. The frequent experience of
practitioners in this and other countries seems to prove that hydrocyanic
acid possesses no such property. It is right at the same time
to mention, that a case published by Dr. Baumgärtner of Freyburg
has been thought by some<a id='r1901' /><a href='#f1901' class='c013'><sup>[1901]</sup></a> to establish the reverse. A man had
taken for two months, on account of chronic catarrh, ten drops of
Ittner’s acid daily in doses of one grain, without experiencing the
slightest toxicological effect. At length he was found one morning
in bed apparently labouring under the poisonous operation of the
acid. He had headache, blindness, dilated insensible pupil, feeble
irregular pulse, occasional suspension of the breathing, and rapidly
increasing insensibility. The cold affusion and ammonia were immediately
resorted to, and at first with advantage. But in no long time
spasms commenced in the toes, and gradually affected the rest of the
body, till at length violent fits of general tetanus were formed, lasting
for six or ten minutes, and alternating in the intervals with coma. Venesection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_589'>589</span>was next resorted to; after which the spasms were confined
to the jaw and eyes. Delirium succeeded, but was removed by a
repetition of the blood-letting. At four in the afternoon he was
tolerably sensible; during the night delirium returned; at ten next
morning he recovered his sight; and on the subsequent morning he
had no complaint but headache and pain in the eyes.<a id='r1902' /><a href='#f1902' class='c013'><sup>[1902]</sup></a> This case
differs so much from every other in the collateral circumstances, as
well as in duration, that, although the symptoms themselves correspond
with those of poisoning with hydrocyanic acid, we may justly
suspect either some other cause, or the accidental administration of
too large a dose. It ought, however, to turn the attention of practitioners
to the possibility of this poison acting by the accumulation
of the effects of small doses frequently repeated for a great length of
time.</p>

<p class='c006'>The period within which hydrocyanic acid usually proves fatal is
fixed with considerable accuracy, not only by the cases observed in
the human subject, but likewise by the experiments of many physiologists,
and more especially those of Schubarth (p. <a href='#Page_583'>583</a>). It is probable
that very large doses occasion death in a few seconds; and
at all events a few minutes will suffice to extinguish life when the dose
is considerable; but if the individual survive forty minutes, he will
generally recover. In the course of a dreadful accident which happened
a few years ago in one of the Parisian hospitals, when seven
epileptic patients were killed at one time by too large doses of the
medicinal acid, it was found that several did not die for forty-five
minutes.<a id='r1903' /><a href='#f1903' class='c013'><sup>[1903]</sup></a> But the researches of Schubarth would certainly justify
the expectation that recovery will take place under active treatment
when the patient survives so long.—These facts may be highly
important in the practice of medical jurisprudence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The period within which it begins to operate ought also to be accurately
ascertained for the same reason. Indeed in a very interesting
trial, which took place a few years ago in this country, the fate
of the prisoner depended in a great measure on the question, within
how short a time the effects of this poison must show themselves?<a id='r1904' /><a href='#f1904' class='c013'><sup>[1904]</sup></a>
The nature of the case was as follows: An apothecary’s maid-servant
at Leicester who was pregnant by her master’s apprentice, was
found one morning dead in bed; and she had obviously been poisoned
with hydrocyanic acid. Circumstances led to the suspicion
that the apprentice was accessary to the administration of the poison.
On the other hand, it was distinctly proved that the deceased had
made arrangements for a miscarriage by artificial means on the night
of her death; and it was therefore represented, on the part of the
prisoner, that she had taken the poison of her own accord. But the
body was found stretched out in bed in a composed posture, with the
arms crossed over the trunk, and the bed-clothes pulled smoothly up
to the chin; and at her right side lay a small narrow-necked phial,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_590'>590</span>from which about five drachms of the medicinal prussic acid had been
taken, and which was corked and wrapped in paper. There naturally
arose a question, whether the deceased, after drinking the poison
out of such a vessel, could, before becoming insensible, have
time to cork up the phial, wrap it up, and adjust the bed-clothes?<a id='r1905' /><a href='#f1905' class='c013'><sup>[1905]</sup></a>
To settle this point, experiments were made at the request of the
judge, by Mr. Macaulay, Mr. Paget, and several other medical men
of Leicester; and on the trial they, with the exception of Mr. Paget,
gave it as their opinion, founded on the experiments, that the supposed
acts of volition, although within the bounds of possibility, were
in the highest degree improbable. The chief experiments were three
in number, from which it appeared that one dog was killed with four
drachms in eight seconds, another with four drachms in seven
seconds, and another with four drachms and a half in three seconds;
but in other experiments the interval was greater.—For these particulars
I am indebted to Mr. Macaulay.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first edition of this work I expressed my concurrence with
the majority of the witnesses. But some facts, which came subsequently
under my notice, led me to think that this concurrence was
given rather too unreservedly. I still adhere so far to my original
views as to think it improbable that, if the deceased, after swallowing
the poison, had time to cork the phial, wrap it in paper, pull up
the bed-clothes, and place the bottle at her side, the progress of the
symptoms could have been so rapid and the convulsions so slight,
as to occasion no disorder in the appearance of the body and the bed-clothes,—and
I still likewise think, that after swallowing so large a
dose it was improbable she could have performed all the successive
acts of volition mentioned above—with ordinary deliberation. But
I am informed on good authority, that some gentlemen interested in
the case found by actual trial, that all the acts alluded to might be
accomplished, if gone about with promptitude, within the short
period, which, in some of their experiments, the witnesses found to
elapse, before the action of the poison commenced. And such being
the fact, we ought not perhaps to attach too great importance to the
other argument I have employed,—the probability of disorder in the
body and bed-clothes from the convulsions; for if the poisoning commenced
very soon, the convulsions might have been slight. The results
of my own experiments related in p. <a href='#Page_582'>582</a>, although on the whole
confirmatory of those of Mr. Macaulay and his colleagues, are nevertheless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_591'>591</span>sufficient to prove that large doses occasionally do not begin
to operate with such rapidity as was observed in their experiments;
for in one instance four drops of concentrated acid, equivalent to two
scruples of medicinal acid, did not begin to act on a rabbit for twenty
seconds; and certainly, for so small an animal, two scruples are as large
a dose as five drachms for a grown-up girl.</p>

<p class='c006'>The two following cases will throw some farther light on the time
within which this poison begins to act on man when taken in large
quantity. The first case shows, that even when an enormous dose is
taken, a few simple voluntary acts may be executed before the symptoms
begin. In this instance which is related by Dr. Gierl of Lindau,
the dose was no less than four ounces of the acid of the Bavarian
Pharmacopœia, which contains four per cent. of pure acid, and is
equivalent to five ounces at least of that commonly used in Britain and
France. The subject, an apothecary’s assistant, was found dead in
bed, with an empty two-ounce phial on each side of the bed,—the
mattrass, which is used in Germany instead of blankets, pulled up as
high as the breast,—the right arm extended straight down beneath
the mattrass,—and the left arm bent on the elbow.<a id='r1906' /><a href='#f1906' class='c013'><sup>[1906]</sup></a> The second
case proves that, although one or two acts of volition may be accomplished,
the interval is so very brief that these acts can only be of the
simplest kind. An apothecary’s apprentice-lad was sent from the
shop to the cellar for some carbonate of potass; but he had not been
a few minutes away, when his companions heard him cry in a voice
of great alarm, “Hartshorn! Hartshorn!” On instantly rushing
down stairs, they found him reclining on the lower steps and
grasping the rail; and he had scarcely time to mutter “Prussic
acid!” when he expired,—not more than five minutes after leaving
the shop. On the floor of the cellar an ounce-phial was found, which
had been filled with the Bavarian hydrocyanic acid, but contained
only a drachm. It appeared that he had taken the acid ignorantly
for an experiment; and from the state of the articles in the cellar, it
was evident that, alarmed at its instantaneous operation, he had tried
to get at the ammonia, which he knew was the antidote, but had
found the tremendous activity of the poison would not allow him
even to undo the coverings of the bottle.<a id='r1907' /><a href='#f1907' class='c013'><sup>[1907]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>When the quantity of the poison is small, a much longer interval
may elapse before the commencement of its action. Thus, when the
dose is barely short of what is required to occasion death, the effects
may be postponed even for fifteen minutes, as in a case which occurred
to Mr. Garson of Stromness.<a id='r1908' /><a href='#f1908' class='c013'><sup>[1908]</sup></a> This, so far as I am at present
aware, is the extreme limit of interval hitherto observed.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the trial related above the prisoner Freeman was found <i>Not
Guilty</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is important to fix, if possible, the smallest fatal dose of hydrocyanic
acid. This will vary with particular circumstances, such as the
strength of the individual, and the fulness or emptiness of the stomach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_592'>592</span>at the time. The cases of the Parisian epileptics, who were killed
each by a draught containing two-thirds of a grain of pure acid,<a id='r1909' /><a href='#f1909' class='c013'><sup>[1909]</sup></a> will
supply pointed information. For, on the one hand, considering the
long time they survived, it is not probable that a dose materially less
would have a fatal effect on man. And on the other hand repeated
instances of recovery have been observed, where the dose was as great
or even greater. Thus Dr. Geoghegan had a patient who recovered
from a state of extreme danger after taking two-thirds of a grain;<a id='r1910' /><a href='#f1910' class='c013'><sup>[1910]</sup></a> and
Mr. Banks of Lowth met with a case of recovery in similar circumstances,
where the dose was very nearly a whole grain.<a id='r1911' /><a href='#f1911' class='c013'><sup>[1911]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It is almost unnecessary to add, that in man, as in animals, this
poison will act violently, through whatever channel it may be introduced
into the body. It has not been positively ascertained to act
with force through the unbroken skin. The chemist Scharinger indeed
was supposed to have been killed in consequence of accidentally
spilling the acid on his naked arm;<a id='r1912' /><a href='#f1912' class='c013'><sup>[1912]</sup></a> but this was in all probability a
mistake. Should the skin be freely exposed to the air it seems reasonable
to expect that the poison will evaporate before it could act
with energy; but if confined by pledgets or otherwise, a different
result might ensue. Through every other surface, however, besides
the unbroken skin, hydrocyanic acid acts with very great power; and
it is in particular important to remember that its power is very great
when inhaled, so that dangerous accidents have ensued even from its
vapour incautiously snuffed up the nostrils. I have known a strong
man suddenly struck down in this way; a French physician, M.
Damiron, has related the case of an apothecary who remained insensible
for half an hour subsequently to the same accident;<a id='r1913' /><a href='#f1913' class='c013'><sup>[1913]</sup></a> and cases
of the kind are more apt to occur than might at first view be thought,
because, contrary to what is generally believed and stated in chemical
as well as medico-legal works, its smell is for a few seconds barely
perceptible, and never of the kind which these accounts would lead
one to anticipate. Accidental death may readily arise from its action
on a wound or an abraded surface. Sobernheim mentions that
Mr. Scharring, a druggist at Vienna, was poisoned in consequence of
a phial of the acid breaking in his hand and wounding it; and he expired
in an hour.<a id='r1914' /><a href='#f1914' class='c013'><sup>[1914]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The only case with which I am acquainted of poisoning with the
artificial compounds of hydrocyanic acid is that formerly alluded to
as having been occasioned by the cyanide of potassium. Six grains
dissolved in a clyster amounting to six ounces, occasioned general
convulsions, palpitations, slow laboured breathing, coldness of the
limbs, dilated pupil, fixing of the eyeballs, and death in one hour,—phenomena
much the same with those produced by the acid itself.<a id='r1915' /><a href='#f1915' class='c013'><sup>[1915]</sup></a>—Another
case has been published, in which a French physician, ignorant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_593'>593</span>of the correct dose, prescribed a potion with three grains of cyanide
of potassium twice a day. Immediately after the first dose the patient
was seized with the usual symptoms of poisoning with hydrocyanic
acid; and expired in three-quarters of an hour.<a id='r1916' /><a href='#f1916' class='c013'><sup>[1916]</sup></a> In noticing the
first of these cases, Orfila draws the attention of practitioners particularly
to the fact, that not long before a similar dose of a sample of
cyanide, which had been moist for some time, was twice administered
with impunity. The reason is that the cyanide of potassium undergoes
decomposition when acted on by water, or when long kept.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section III</span>.—<i>Of the Morbid Appearances produced by Hydrocyanic Acid.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Under this head the appearances in a special case will first be mentioned,
and then the varieties to which they are liable.</p>

<p class='c006'>In <i>Hufeland’s</i> case [p. <a href='#Page_587'>587</a>] the inspection was made the day after
death. The eyes were still glistening, like those of a person alive;
but the countenance was pale and composed like one asleep. The
spine and neck were stiff, the belly drawn in, the back alone livid.
The body generally, the blood even within the head, and especially
the serous cavities, exhaled a hydrocyanic odour, so strong as to irritate
the nostrils. The blood was every where very fluid, so that two
pounds flowed from the incision in the scalp and twelve ounces from
that of the dura mater; and it had a glimmering bluish appearance,
as if Prussian blue had been mixed with it. The vessels of the brain
were gorged, the substance of the brain natural, and the left ventricle
distended with half an ounce of serum. The villous coat of the
stomach was red, easily removed with the nail, and gangrenous.<a id='r1917' /><a href='#f1917' class='c013'><sup>[1917]</sup></a>
The intestines were reddish, and the liver gorged. The lungs were
also turgid, and to such a degree in the depending parts as to resemble
the liver. The arteries and left cavities of the heart were empty,
the veins and right cavities distended.</p>

<p class='c006'>In commenting on this description it is first to be remarked, that
the blood, as in the preceding case, is generally altered in nature.
Ittner, who made some good experiments on the subject, found it in
animals black, viscid, and oily in consistence.<a id='r1918' /><a href='#f1918' class='c013'><sup>[1918]</sup></a> Emmert found it
fluid and of a cochineal colour. In a case related by Mertzdorff of
an apothecary’s apprentice, who was found dead in bed after swallowing
three drachms and a half of diluted acid,<a id='r1919' /><a href='#f1919' class='c013'><sup>[1919]</sup></a> in the case recorded in
Horn’s Archiv, and in that related by Dr. Gierl, it was fluid. It was
also perfectly fluid every where in the bodies of the seven epileptic
patients poisoned at Paris. Yet this state is not invariable. Coullon,
though his results tally in general with those of Ittner and Emmert,
has given some experiments in which the blood coagulated after flowing
from the body;<a id='r1920' /><a href='#f1920' class='c013'><sup>[1920]</sup></a> and in the case of an apothecary related in Rust’s
Journal it was found coagulated in the heart.<a id='r1921' /><a href='#f1921' class='c013'><sup>[1921]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_594'>594</span>In the next place, Magendie and other physiologists have observed
that, as in Hufeland’s case, the blood and cavities of the body in animals
exhale a hydrocyanic odour, even though the quantity taken was
small. The blood did so likewise in the heart of the apothecary just
mentioned as well as throughout the whole body in the case described
in Horn’s Journal. The odour, however, is not always present.
For example, there was none in the case of another German apothecary,
who poisoned himself with an ounce, as recorded in a later volume
of Rust’s Journal;<a id='r1922' /><a href='#f1922' class='c013'><sup>[1922]</sup></a> neither was there any odour in the blood
in Mertzdorff’s case, although it was strong in the stomach; nor in the
blood nor any other part of the body in the Parisian epileptics. It also appears
from an experiment by Schubarth,<a id='r1923' /><a href='#f1923' class='c013'><sup>[1923]</sup></a> and from a case by Leuret
where life was prolonged above fifteen minutes,<a id='r1924' /><a href='#f1924' class='c013'><sup>[1924]</sup></a>—that the odour may
be distinct in the blood, brain, or chest, when hardly any is to be perceived
in the stomach. Schubarth has inquired with some care into
the circumstances under which the hydrocyanic odour may, or may
not, be expected. He states, as the result of his researches, that if
the dose is sufficient to cause death within ten minutes, the peculiar
odour will always be remarked in the blood of the heart, lungs, and
great vessels, provided the body have not been exposed to rain or to
a current of air, and the examination be made within a moderate interval,—for
example, twenty-one hours for so small an animal as a
dog; but that, if the dose is so small that life is prolonged for fifteen,
twenty-seven, or thirty-two minutes, then even immediately after
death it may be impossible to remark any of the peculiar odour, evidently
because, as already mentioned, the acid is rapidly discharged
by the lungs; and that even when the dose is large enough to cause
death in four minutes, the smell may not be perceived if the carcase
has been left in a spacious apartment for two days, or exposed to a
shower for a few hours only. These facts explain satisfactorily why
no odour could be perceived in the bodies of the Parisian epileptics;
for they lived from half an hour to forty-five minutes. The poison
may exist in the stomach, though not appreciable by the sense of
smell. In Chevallier’s case mentioned above, the contents of the
stomach had not any odour of hydrocyanic acid; which, however,
was evident to the sense of smell, and plainly indicated by various
tests, in the fluid obtained by distilling the contents.</p>

<p class='c006'>The presence of this odour in the blood may be accounted strong
evidence of poisoning with hydrocyanic acid, if it is unequivocal to
the sense of several individuals. An exhalation of the same kind is
occasionally formed by natural processes in the excrement. Itard
once remarked in a case of inflammation of the intestines, and again
in a case of inflamed liver, a strong smell of bitter almonds in the
fæces, although no medicine containing hydrocyanic acid had been
given.<a id='r1925' /><a href='#f1925' class='c013'><sup>[1925]</sup></a> Mr. Taylor mentions that he once observed a sort of hydrocyanic
odour in the brain of a person who died of natural disease.<a id='r1926' /><a href='#f1926' class='c013'><sup>[1926]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_595'>595</span>These facts will render the inspector cautious, but can scarcely throw
a doubt over evidence derived from an unequivocal hydrocyanic
odour in the blood.</p>

<p class='c006'>Few successful attempts have yet been made to detect the acid in
the blood by chemical analysis. The odour may be present, although
chemical analysis fails in eliciting any indication. This follows
from the observations of Dr. Lonsdale,<a id='r1927' /><a href='#f1927' class='c013'><sup>[1927]</sup></a> as well as of various authors
quoted by him in his paper. The cyanide of potassium has been
detected by Mayer not merely in the blood, but likewise in the serous
secretions and sundry soft solids.<a id='r1928' /><a href='#f1928' class='c013'><sup>[1928]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In most instances,—for example, in the Parisian epileptics, the
state of the brain, as to turgescence of vessels, has corresponded with
the description given by Hufeland. Venous turgescence and emptiness
of the arterial system are commonly remarked throughout the
whole body. Thus in the epileptic patients, the heart and great
arteries were empty; the great veins gorged; the spleen gorged,
soft, and pultaceous; the veins of the liver gorged; and the kidneys
of a deep violet colour, much softened, and their veins gorged with
black blood.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is impossible that hydrocyanic acid could cause gangrene of the
stomach, which is said to have been witnessed in Hufeland’s case.
But there are often signs of irritation in that organ. The villous coat
has been found red in animals; it was shrivelled, and its vessels
were turgid with black blood in the instance of the apothecary mentioned
in the fourteenth volume of Rust’s Journal; in Mertzdorff’s
case it was red and checkered with bloody streaks; and in the case
related by Dr. Gierl, where four ounces were swallowed, it was dark-red,
as it were tanned or steeped in spirits, and easily separated
from the subjacent contents. The contents of the stomach have in
every instance had a strong hydrocyanic odour, except in the cases
of the Parisian epileptics, and in those related by Leuret and by
Chevallier. According to the experiments of Lassaigne and Schubarth,
formerly noticed, it is not to be looked for when the body has
been kept a few days, more especially if the individual lived some
time. Dr. Lonsdale generally found it eight or nine days after death
in animals, which had been either buried during that time, or kept
in an apartment at the temperature of 50° F.<a id='r1929' /><a href='#f1929' class='c013'><sup>[1929]</sup></a> In a case which
occurred not long ago in London the poison was found in the stomach
five days after death. A coroner’s inquest had terminated in
a verdict of natural death. But suspicions having arisen, that the
man had poisoned himself in anticipation of a charge of forgery,
another inquiry was made; when the odour of hydrocyanic acid was
evolved from the contents of the stomach, and the distilled water
obtained from them yielded decisive chemical evidence of its being
present.<a id='r1930' /><a href='#f1930' class='c013'><sup>[1930]</sup></a> It is important to observe, in reference to the evidence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_596'>596</span>hydrocyanic acid in the stomach, that here, as in the instance of the
blood, the odour may be strong, and yet the poison may not be discoverable
by analysis. This fact rests on the united testimony of
Coullon, Vauquelin, Leuret, Turner, and Dr. Lonsdale; the last of
whom mentions that he could not detect it chemically after the fourth
day in the bodies of some animals, in which it was perceptible by
its odour even four or five days later.<a id='r1931' /><a href='#f1931' class='c013'><sup>[1931]</sup></a> It is possible, however, that
these failures to detect the poison by analysis may have sometimes
arisen from imperfections in the method of analysis employed; for it
was detected by the process formerly mentioned in the stomach of
the apothecary last alluded to, in Chevallier’s case, though not perceptible
to the smell, and frequently by Lassaigne in animals.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mertzdorff remarked both in his case of poisoning with hydrocyanic
acid, and likewise in a parallel instance of poisoning with the
essential oil of bitter almonds,<a id='r1932' /><a href='#f1932' class='c013'><sup>[1932]</sup></a> a singular appearance in the bile,
the colour of which was altered to deep blue.</p>

<p class='c006'>Coullon and Emmert say they have observed, that the bodies of
animals resist putrefaction. The latter in particular mentions, that
he had left them several days in a warm room without perceiving
any sign of decay. This certainly would not <i>à priori</i> be expected,
considering the state of the blood. And it is not universal; for in
one instance, the case of Mertzdorff, putrefaction commenced within
thirty hours after death. In the Parisian epileptics, the bodies passed
through the usual stage of rigidity.</p>

<p class='c006'>It appears that even long after death the eye, as in Hufeland’s
case, has a peculiar glistening and staring expression, so as to render
it difficult to believe that the individual is really dead; and this appearance
has been considered by Dr. Paris so remarkable, as even
alone to supply “decisive evidence of poisoning by hydrocyanic
acid.”<a id='r1933' /><a href='#f1933' class='c013'><sup>[1933]</sup></a> But the accuracy of this opinion may be questioned. The
appearance is indeed very general in cases of poisoning with preparations
containing hydrocyanic acid. Besides occurring in the case
of Hufeland, and in that which gave occasion to Dr. Paris’s statement,
it was witnessed by Mertzdorff, and in the instance described
in Horn’s Journal. But it is not a constant appearance; for it was
not observed in the seven Parisian epileptics. Neither is it peculiar;
for death from carbonic acid has the same effect; I have remarked
it six hours after death in a woman who died of cholera; and it has
been observed in cases of death during the epileptic paroxysm.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Section IV.</span>—<i>Of the Treatment of Poisoning with Hydrocyanic Acid.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Much attention has been lately paid to the treatment of this variety
of poisoning; and the object of those who have studied it has naturally
been the discovery of an antidote.</p>

<p class='c006'>An antidote to hydrocyanic acid must either be a substance which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_597'>597</span>renders it immediately insoluble, or one which exerts upon the body
an action contrary to that excited by the poison, that is, a powerful
stimulant action on the nervous system. Hence all such remedies as
oil, milk, soap, coffee, treacle, turpentine, at one time thought serviceable,
are quite inert.<a id='r1934' /><a href='#f1934' class='c013'><sup>[1934]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Antidotes have hitherto been chiefly sought for among the powerful,
diffusible stimulants. And it is plain, that even although a chemical
antidote were known, a stimulant antidote is indispensable also, because
the mischief done, before the poison can be rendered inert, is
generally sufficient to cause death, unless counteracted by treatment.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of the diffusible stimulants, <i>ammonia</i> is considered by many the
most energetic antidote. The first who made careful experiments
with it was Mr. John Murray of London; and he was so convinced
of its efficacy, that he expressed himself ready to swallow a dose of
the acid large enough to prove fatal, provided a skilful person were
beside him to administer the antidote.<a id='r1935' /><a href='#f1935' class='c013'><sup>[1935]</sup></a> The favourable results obtained
by Murray were afterwards confirmed by M. Dupuy.<a id='r1936' /><a href='#f1936' class='c013'><sup>[1936]</sup></a> Afterwards,
however, the efficacy of ammonia was called in question.
Orfila stated in the third edition of his Toxicology that he had several
times satisfied himself of the complete inutility of this as well as
many other antidotes.<a id='r1937' /><a href='#f1937' class='c013'><sup>[1937]</sup></a> And Dr. Herbst of Göttingen made some
careful experiments, from which he concludes that ammonia, though
useful when the dose of poison is not large enough to kill, and even
capable of making an animal that has taken a fatal dose jump up and
run about for a little, yet will never save its life.<a id='r1938' /><a href='#f1938' class='c013'><sup>[1938]</sup></a> But farther experiments
by Orfila have led him to modify his former statement, and
to admit, that, although liquid ammonia is of no use when introduced
into the stomach, yet if the vapour from it is inhaled, life may
sometimes be preserved, provided the dose of the poison be not large
enough to act with great rapidity. He remarked, that when from
eight to fourteen drops of the medicinal acid were given to dogs of
various sizes, they died in the course of fifteen minutes if left without
assistance, but were sometimes saved by being made to inhale ammoniacal
water, and recovered completely in little more than an
hour.<a id='r1939' /><a href='#f1939' class='c013'><sup>[1939]</sup></a> As this is very nearly the conclusion to which Mr. Murray
was led by his experiments performed in 1822, it is rather extraordinary,
that his name, as the undoubted discoverer of the remedy,
has never been mentioned by the Parisian Professor. Buchner, it is
right to add, had found this remedy useful in the same year in which
Mr. Murray’s experiments were made.<a id='r1940' /><a href='#f1940' class='c013'><sup>[1940]</sup></a> A gentleman who took an
over-dose of two drachms of hydrocyanic acid while using it medicinally,
and who seems to have been in great danger, owed his recovery
to the assiduous use of carbonate of ammonia held to the
nostrils, and spirit of ammonia internally. Relief was obtained immediately.<a id='r1941' /><a href='#f1941' class='c013'><sup>[1941]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_598'>598</span>Orfila suggests an important caution,—not to use a
strong ammoniacal liquor, otherwise the mouth, air-passages, and
even the alimentary canal may be attacked with inflammation,—as
indeed happened to the French physician whose case was formerly
mentioned. The strong <i>aqua ammoniæ</i> should be diluted with several
parts of water.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another remedy of the same kind with ammonia as to action is
<i>chlorine</i>. This substance was first proposed as a remedy in 1822 by
Riauz, a chemist of Ulm, who found that, when a pigeon, poisoned
with hydrocyanic acid, was on the point of expiring, it immediately
began to revive, on being made to breathe chlorine, and in fifteen
minutes was able to fly away.<a id='r1942' /><a href='#f1942' class='c013'><sup>[1942]</sup></a> Buchner repeated Riauz’s experiments
and arrived at the same results. More lately M. Simeon,
apothecary to the hospital of St. Louis at Paris, apparently without
being acquainted with the observations of the German chemists, was
likewise led to suppose, that this gas might prove a useful antidote;<a id='r1943' /><a href='#f1943' class='c013'><sup>[1943]</sup></a>
and MM. Cottereau and Vallette have formed the same conclusion.<a id='r1944' /><a href='#f1944' class='c013'><sup>[1944]</sup></a>
Orfila in his paper already quoted expresses his conviction, that this
remedy is the most powerful antidote of all hitherto proposed. His
experiments have convinced him, that animals, which have taken a
dose of poison sufficient to kill them in fifteen or eighteen minutes,
will be saved by inspiring water impregnated with a fourth part of
its volume of chlorine, even although the application of the remedy
be delayed till the poison has operated for four or five minutes. In
some of his experiments he waited till the convulsive stage of the
poisoning was passed, and the stage of flaccidity and insensibility
had supervened; yet the animals were obviously out of danger ten
minutes after the chlorine was first applied, and recovered entirely
in three-quarters of an hour.<a id='r1945' /><a href='#f1945' class='c013'><sup>[1945]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The last remedy of this nature which deserves notice is the <i>cold
affusion</i>. This was first recommended by Dr. Herbst of Göttingen,
who, on account of the success he witnessed from it in animals,
considers it the best remedy yet proposed. When the dose of the
poison was insufficient to prove fatal in ordinary circumstances, two
affusions he found commonly sufficient to dispel every unpleasant
symptom. When the dose was larger, it was necessary to repeat the
effusion more frequently. Its efficacy was always most certain when
resorted to before the convulsive stage of the poisoning was over;
yet even in the stage of insensibility and paralysis it was sometimes
employed with success. In the latter instance the first sign of amendment
was renewal of the spasms of the muscles. Many experiments
are related by the author in support of these statements. But the
most decisive is the following. Two poodles of the same size being
selected, hydrocyanic acid was given to one of them in repeated
small doses till it died. The whole quantity administered being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_599'>599</span>seven grains of Ittner’s acid, this dose was given at once to the other
dog. Immediately it fell down in convulsions, violent opisthotonos
ensued, and in half a minute the convulsive stage was followed by
flaccidity, imperceptible respiration, and failing pulse. The cold
affusion was immediately resorted to, but at first without any amendment.
After the second affusion, however, the opisthotonos returned,
and was accompanied by cries; and on the remedy being repeated
every fifteen minutes, the breathing gradually became easier and
easier, the spasms abated, and in a few hours the animal was quite
well.<a id='r1946' /><a href='#f1946' class='c013'><sup>[1946]</sup></a> Professor Orfila repeated Dr. Herbst’s experiments, with
analogous results; but he considers the cold affusion inferior to
chlorine.<a id='r1947' /><a href='#f1947' class='c013'><sup>[1947]</sup></a>—It is probably advantageous to apply the cold water
rather in the form of cold douche to the head and spine than to the
body at large. Dr. Robinson of Sunderland found that rabbits,
which had taken doses adequate to occasion death, might be saved
by pouring on the hindhead and along the spine cold water impregnated
with common salt and nitre.<a id='r1948' /><a href='#f1948' class='c013'><sup>[1948]</sup></a> A case, which seems to
have been cured in this way, has been published by Mr. Banks of
Lowth. A young woman took by mistake a solution containing very
nearly a grain of real acid, and immediately became insensible and
convulsed. Ordinary stimulants were of no use. But in fifteen
minutes, when the convulsions had ceased, and she lay in a state of
complete coma and general paralysis, the cold douche on the head
first renewed the convulsions, then strengthened the pulse and restored
some appearance of consciousness, and finally roused her, so
that in a few hours she was quite well.<a id='r1949' /><a href='#f1949' class='c013'><sup>[1949]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It is probable, that <i>bleeding from the jugular vein</i> deserves more
attention as a remedy than it has yet received. The right side of
the heart is almost invariably found much gorged with blood in
animals examined at the moment of death; and the contractions of
the heart, in such circumstances imperfect or arrested altogether,
have often been observed by experimentalists to be instantly restored
on promptly removing the state of turgescence. Accordingly Dr.
Cormack found that a dog, at the point of death after receiving a
fatal dose of the acid, was speedily roused and eventually saved by
bleeding from the jugular vein.<a id='r1950' /><a href='#f1950' class='c013'><sup>[1950]</sup></a> And in a careful inquiry by Dr.
Lonsdale, it was ascertained that the turgescence of the heart might
be effectually diminished in this way, and that recovery might frequently
be accomplished when the poison was otherwise amply sufficient
to have occasioned speedy death.<a id='r1951' /><a href='#f1951' class='c013'><sup>[1951]</sup></a> In a case treated by
Magendie, that of a young lady poisoned by too large a medicinal
dose, the chief remedies were ammonia and blood-letting from the
jugular vein; and she recovered.<a id='r1952' /><a href='#f1952' class='c013'><sup>[1952]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_600'>600</span>Few observations have hitherto been made on the chemical antidotes
for hydrocyanic acid, or those substances which render it innoxious
by converting it into an insoluble compound. It is plain
that several probable antidotes of this kind exist. But toxicologists
have been apparently deterred from trying them by the fearful rapidity
with which the poison acts, and the consequent improbability
that in practice any such antidote can be administered in time. It
has lately been shown, however, by Messrs. T. and H. Smith of this
city, that the effects of a fatal dose may be warded off by the timely
administration of the reagents necessary for converting the acid into
Prussian blue. They found that if a solution of carbonate of potash
followed by a solution of the mixed sulphates of iron be given to
animals very soon after the administration of a dose of thirty drops
of the Edinburgh medicinal acid, containing three per cent. of real
acid, recovery in general takes place, and sometimes little inconvenience
seems to be sustained. The solutions they used were one
of 144 grains of carbonate of potash in two ounces of water, and
another composed of a drachm and a half of sulphate of protoxide of
iron, together with two drachms of the same salt converted into sulphate
of sesquioxide by means of sulphuric and nitric acids in the
usual way. About 52 minims of each of these solutions will remove the
whole acid contained in 100 grains of the Edinburgh medicinal acid;
but for certainty, three or four times as much should be used,—which
may be done with perfect safety.<a id='r1953' /><a href='#f1953' class='c013'><sup>[1953]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>On the whole, then, it appears that the proper treatment of a case
of poisoning with hydrocyanic acid consists in the cold affusion applied
to the head and spine, the inhalation of diluted ammonia or
chlorine, venesection at the jugular vein, and the administration of
carbonate of potash and the mixed sulphates of iron, if aid has been
obtained in good time.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is right to remember, however, that on account of the dreadful
rapidity of this variety of poisoning, it will rarely be in the physician’s
power to resort to any treatment soon enough for success;—and
farther, that his chance of success must generally be feeble even
though the case be taken in time, because when hydrocyanic acid is
swallowed by man, the dose is commonly so large as not to be counteracted
by any remedies.</p>

<h5 class='c011'><i>On the Vegetable Substances which contain Hydrocyanic Acid.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>Hydrocyanic acid exists in several plants; which are consequently
poisonous. I have considered it advisable to describe their effects
separately from those of the pure acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>The plants which have been thoroughly examined and found to
yield it belong chiefly to the division <i>Drupaceæ</i>, of Decandolle’s Natural
Family the <i>Rosaceæ</i>. These are the bitter almond, cherry-laurel,
bird-cherry, and peach. The leaves and seeds of the nectarine
and apricot, and the seeds of the plum and cherry, have the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_601'>601</span>same taste with these four, and therefore will certainly be found to
contain the acid also. The same inference may be drawn from the
taste of some pomaceous seeds; and accordingly I have obtained a
hydrocyanated oil from the seeds of the New York pippin, and
those of the white-beam-tree, the <i>Pyrus aria</i>. The poison procured
from these sources exists in two forms,—as a distilled water,
and as an essential oil. Further, the acid has been discovered to
constitute the active poison of the juice of the <i>Janipha manihot</i>, or
bitter cassava [see p. <a href='#Page_457'>457</a>].</p>

<p class='c006'>The distilled waters yield hydrocyanic acid, as is shown by the
blue precipitate they give with potass and the mixed sulphates of
iron. They have a powerful, peculiar, grateful odour, which is
usually likened to that of pure hydrocyanic acid. But the smell
really bears very little resemblance to that of hydrocyanic acid, and
is not owing to its presence: the odour remains equally strong after
the acid is thrown down by the test now mentioned. The active
part of the distilled water may be separated in the form of a volatile
oil. This is colourless at first, afterwards yellowish or reddish, acrid,
bitter, heavier than water, and very volatile. The essential oil of
the bitter almond has been carefully examined by various chemists.
Vogel, by subjecting it twice to distillation from caustic potass, procured
hydrocyanate of potass in the residue; and a volatile oil was
distilled over, which no longer contained hydrocyanic acid, but nevertheless
had the odour of the original oil.<a id='r1954' /><a href='#f1954' class='c013'><sup>[1954]</sup></a> This purified oil he considered
equally poisonous with that which contains hydrocyanic acid, a single
drop of it having killed a sparrow; and his opinion was confirmed by
the experiments of Professor Orfila. But according to some careful experiments
by Stange,<a id='r1955' /><a href='#f1955' class='c013'><sup>[1955]</sup></a> which have been amply confirmed by Dr.
Göppert of Breslau,<a id='r1956' /><a href='#f1956' class='c013'><sup>[1956]</sup></a> and also by MM. Robiquet and Boutron-Charlard,<a id='r1957' /><a href='#f1957' class='c013'><sup>[1957]</sup></a>—if
the purified oil retains active poisonous properties, this
must be owing to the acid not having been entirely removed. Göppert
in particular remarked that twenty-five drops of the purified
bitter-almond oil, cherry-laurel oil, or bird-cherry oil had very little
effect on rabbits, not more indeed than the same quantity of the common
essential oils. The purified oil, according to all these chemists,
possesses the odour of the original oil, as Vogel first stated.</p>

<h5 class='c011'><i>Of the Bitter Almond.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>The bitter almond was once extensively used in medicine, and is
still much employed by confectioners for flavouring puddings, sweetmeats,
and liqueurs. It is the kernel of the fruit of the <i>Amygdalus
communis</i>. This species has two varieties, the <i>dulcis</i> and the <i>amara</i>;
which differ from one another in the fruit only. The fruit of the
former yields the sweet, and of the latter the bitter almond. The
bitter almond is the smaller of the two. The two plants, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_602'>602</span>to Murray, are convertible into each other,—the sweet variety becoming
bitter by neglect,—the bitter becoming sweet by cultivation,
or certain modes of management not well known,—and the seed of
either variety producing plants of both.<a id='r1958' /><a href='#f1958' class='c013'><sup>[1958]</sup></a> These statements as to the
mutual convertibility of the two varieties require confirmation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The bitter almond depends for its activity on the essential oil,
which is common to all the vegetable poisons belonging to the
present tribe. According to the researches of Robiquet and Boutron-Charlard,
followed up by Liebig, the oil does not, like common essential
oils, exist ready formed in the almond, but is only produced
when the almond-pulp comes in contact with water. It cannot be
separated by any process whatever from the almond without the co-operation
of water,—neither, for example, by pressing out the fixed
oil, nor by the action of ether, nor by the action of absolute alcohol.
After the almond is exhausted by ether, the remaining pulp gives the
essential oil as soon as it is moistened; but if it is also exhausted by
alcohol, the essential oil is entirely lost. The reason is that alcohol
dissolves out a peculiar crystalline principle, named amygdalin,
which, with the co-operation of water, forms the essential oil by
reacting on a variety of the albuminous principle in the almond,
called emulsion or synoptase.</p>

<p class='c006'>In some respects, therefore, the essential oil of almonds is quite
peculiar in its nature, and quite different from the common essential
or volatile oils.—The presence of hydrocyanic acid in it is easily
proved by dissolving it with agitation in water, and treating the solution
with caustic potass, followed by the mixed sulphates of iron
and sulphuric acid.—The quantity of essential oil which may be
procured from the bitter almond amounts, according to Krüger of
Rostock, to four drachms from five pounds or a ninety-sixth part.<a id='r1959' /><a href='#f1959' class='c013'><sup>[1959]</sup></a>
The quantity of hydrocyanic acid in the oil varies considerably:
Schrader got from an old sample 8·5 per cent., from a new sample
10·75;<a id='r1960' /><a href='#f1960' class='c013'><sup>[1960]</sup></a> but Göppert got from another specimen so much as 14·33
per cent.<a id='r1961' /><a href='#f1961' class='c013'><sup>[1961]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Effects on Animals.</i>—The bitter almond is a powerful poison,
which acts in the same way as hydrocyanic acid, but likewise excites
at times vomiting and other signs of irritation. The first good experiments
on it are those related in Wepfer’s treatise on the Cicuta;
but its properties seem to have been known even to Dioscorides.
The symptoms it induces in animals are trembling, weakness, palsy,
convulsions, often of the tetanic kind, and finally coma. But frequently
it occasions vomiting before these symptoms begin, and the
animal in that way may escape.<a id='r1962' /><a href='#f1962' class='c013'><sup>[1962]</sup></a> According to Orfila, twenty
almonds will kill a dog in six hours by the stomach if the gullet be
tied; and six will kill it in four days when applied to a wound.<a id='r1963' /><a href='#f1963' class='c013'><sup>[1963]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_603'>603</span>The essential oil is not much inferior in activity to the pure hydrocyanic
acid. A single drop of it applied by Sir B. Brodie on the
tongue of a cat caused violent convulsions and death in five minutes.<a id='r1964' /><a href='#f1964' class='c013'><sup>[1964]</sup></a>
But more generally a larger dose, or about seven drops, has been
found necessary to kill a middle-sized dog. Five drops, according
to Göppert, will kill a rabbit in six minutes. When entirely freed of
hydrocyanic acid, it becomes, as already mentioned, not more poisonous
than common volatile oils.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Symptoms in Man.</i>—The effects of the almond and of the oil upon
man are equally striking with those of hydrocyanic acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>In small doses the bitter almond produces disorder of the digestive
organs, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes diarrhœa. These symptoms
are occasionally brought on by the small quantities used for flavouring
sweetmeats, if the confectioner has not been careful in compounding
them. Virey says that accidents occasionally happen to children at
Paris from their eating freely of macaroons, which are sometimes too
strongly flavoured with the bitter almond.<a id='r1965' /><a href='#f1965' class='c013'><sup>[1965]</sup></a> In this country accidents
from the same cause may be with justice apprehended, as confectioners
now generally use, not the bitter almond, but its essential oil,
which is distilled for the purpose in London, and sold in the druggists
shops under the name of peach-nut oil. Göppert suggests that
this oil ought to be freed of its hydrocyanic acid by repeated distillation
with caustic potassa, because the flavour is not in the least injured
by the process, while its activity as a poison is greatly lessened.</p>

<p class='c006'>In peculiar constitutions the minutest quantity, even a single
almond, will cause a state resembling intoxication, succeeded by an
eruption like nettle-rash. The late Dr. Gregory was subject to be
affected in this way. Other vegetable bitters had the same effect on
him, but none so remarkably as bitter almonds. They caused first
sickness, generally tremors, then vomiting, next a hot fit with an
eruption of urticaria, particularly on the upper part of the body. At
the same time the face, and head swelled very much, and there was
generally a feeling like intoxication. The symptoms lasted only for
a few hours. The rash did not alternately appear and disappear as
in common nettle-rash.<a id='r1966' /><a href='#f1966' class='c013'><sup>[1966]</sup></a> A lady of my acquaintance is liable to be
attacked with urticaria even from eating the sweet almond.</p>

<p class='c006'>The quantity of bitter almonds which may be eaten with impunity
is unknown; but Wibmer mentions an experimentalist who took half
an ounce without any other effect besides headache and sickness.<a id='r1967' /><a href='#f1967' class='c013'><sup>[1967]</sup></a>
Two cases of death in the human subject from eating them have
been quoted by Coullon from the Journal de Médecine of Montpellier.
One is a doubtful case, but the other is unequivocal. A bath-woman
gave her child the “expressed juice” of a handful of bitter
almonds to cure worms. The child, who was four years old, was
immediately attacked with colic, swelling of the belly, giddiness,
locked jaw, frothing at the mouth, general convulsions, and insensibility,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_604'>604</span>and died in two hours.<a id='r1968' /><a href='#f1968' class='c013'><sup>[1968]</sup></a> Murray, however, asserts in his
Apparatus Medicaminum that the expressed juice is sweet and not
poisonous.<a id='r1969' /><a href='#f1969' class='c013'><sup>[1969]</sup></a> But this apparent contradiction is easily explained by
referring to the chemical relations of the almond,—the oil expressed
without water being free from essential oil, while the milky fluid
expressed from the pulp beat up with water is strongly impregnated
with it.—Another case was published not long ago by Mr. Kennedy
of London; but the symptoms were imperfectly ascertained. The
person, a stout labourer, appeared to have eaten a great quantity of
bitter almonds, which were subsequently found in the stomach. He
was seen to drop down while standing near a wall; soon after which
the surgeon who was sent for found him quite insensible, with the
pulse imperceptible, and the breath exhaling the odour of bitter
almonds; and death took place in no long time.<a id='r1970' /><a href='#f1970' class='c013'><sup>[1970]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Coullon has noticed many other instances where alarming symptoms
were produced by this poison, but were dissipated by the supervention
of spontaneous vomiting.</p>

<p class='c006'>The effects of small doses of the oil have been tried by Sir B.
Brodie on himself; and a fatal case of poisoning with it has been
recorded by Mertzdorff. In the course of his experiments Sir B.
Brodie once happened to touch his tongue with the end of a glass
rod which happened to be dipped in the oil; and he says he had
scarcely done so before he felt an uneasy, indescribable feeling in the
pit of the stomach, great feebleness of his limbs, and loss of power
to direct the muscles, so that he could hardly keep himself from
falling. These sensations were quite momentary.<a id='r1971' /><a href='#f1971' class='c013'><sup>[1971]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Mertzdorff’s case is interesting, not only as being accurately related,
but likewise on account of the exact resemblance of the symptoms
to those observed in the celebrated case of Sir Theodosius
Boughton, which will presently be mentioned. A hypochondriacal
gentleman, 48 years old, swallowed two drachms of the essential oil.
A few minutes afterwards, his servant, whom he sent for, found him
lying in bed, with his features spasmodically contracted, his eyes
fixed, staring, and turned upwards, and his chest heaving convulsively
and hurriedly. A physician, who entered the room twenty
minutes after the draught had been taken, found him quite insensible,
the pupils immoveable, the breathing stertorous and slow, the pulse
feeble and only 30 in a minute, and the breath strongly impregnated
with the odour of bitter almonds, death ensued ten minutes afterwards.<a id='r1972' /><a href='#f1972' class='c013'><sup>[1972]</sup></a>
A fatal case occurred lately in London, where the individual,
intending to compound a nostrum for worms with beech-nut oil, got
by mistake from the druggist peach-nut oil, which is nothing else
than the oil of bitter almond.—A singular case of recovery from a
very large dose of this poison has been lately published by M. Chevasse.
A shopkeeper, who swallowed half an ounce by mistake for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_605'>605</span>spirit of nitric ether, had an attack of spontaneous vomiting, which
was forthwith encouraged by sulphate of zinc. He nevertheless
became pale and convulsed; the pulse disappeared; and delirious
muttering ensued, with <i>risus sardonicus</i>, sparkling of the eyes, and
panting respiration. Recovery, however, took place under the use
of brandy and ammonia.<a id='r1973' /><a href='#f1973' class='c013'><sup>[1973]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The morbid appearances are the same as in poisoning with the
pure acid. In Mertzdorff’s case the whole blood and body emitted
a smell of almonds; putrefaction had begun, though the inspection
was made twenty-nine hours after death; the blood throughout was
fluid, and flowed from the nostrils and mouth; the veins were every
where turgid; the cerebral vessels gorged; the stomach and intestines
very red.—In the case from the Medical and Physical Journal of
poisoning with the almond itself, the vessels of the brain were much
gorged, and the eyes glistening and staring as if the person had been
alive.</p>

<h5 class='c011'><i>Of the Cherry-Laurel.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>The cherry-laurel, or <i>Cerasus lauro-cerasus</i>, was at one time much
used for flavouring liqueurs and sweetmeats. But it is now less employed
than formerly, as fatal accidents have happened from its having
been used in too large quantity. The custom, however, has not
been altogether abandoned; for there is an account in an English
newspaper in 1823 of two persons killed by ratifia’d brandy, which
had been flavoured with this plant; and Dr. Paris has mentioned an
instance of several children at an English boarding-school having
been dangerously affected by a custard flavoured with the leaves.<a id='r1974' /><a href='#f1974' class='c013'><sup>[1974]</sup></a>
Almost every part of the plant is poisonous, especially the leaves and
kernels; but the pulp of the cherry is not. The flower has a totally
different odour from the leaves. The healthy vigorous shoots in the
early part of summer, and the inner bark, both then and in autumn,
smell strongly of the bitter almond when broken across. The kernels
of the seeds have a strong taste of bitter almonds.—The plant
yields a distilled water and an essential oil, which Robiquet found
to have all the chemical properties of the oil of bitter almond.<a id='r1975' /><a href='#f1975' class='c013'><sup>[1975]</sup></a>—A
very peculiar source of danger in using the leaves of this plant, for
imparting a ratafia flavour to sweetmeats and liqueurs, is that the proportion
of oil varies excessively according to the age of the leaf. It
abounds most in the young undeveloped leaves, and diminishes gradually
afterwards. Hence, the leaves being evergreen and outliving
more than two summers, the young leaves in May or June contain,
as I have found, nearly ten times as much oil as the old ones at the
same moment.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cherry-laurel oil, according to Schrader, contains 7·66 per cent. of
hydrocyanic acid;<a id='r1976' /><a href='#f1976' class='c013'><sup>[1976]</sup></a> but according to Göppert, a specimen supposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_606'>606</span>to be genuine gave only 2·75 per cent.<a id='r1977' /><a href='#f1977' class='c013'><sup>[1977]</sup></a> It is probably therefore a
weaker poison than the oil of bitter almond. The latest experiments
made with this oil are those of some Florentine physicians, performed
at the laboratory of the Marquess Rodolphi, and described by Professor
Taddei.<a id='r1978' /><a href='#f1978' class='c013'><sup>[1978]</sup></a> Sixteen drops put on the tongue of rabbits killed
them in nine, fifteen, or twenty minutes; and ten or twelve drops
injected in oil into the anus killed them in four minutes. The symptoms
were slow breathing, palsy of the hind-legs, then general convulsions;
and death was preceded by complete coma. A very extraordinary
appearance was found in the dead body,—blood extravasated
abundantly in the trachea and lungs.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cherry-laurel water, prepared by distillation from the leaves
of this plant, was long the most important of the poisons which
contain the hydrocyanic acid, as it was the most common before the
introduction of the acid itself into medical practice. Water dissolves
by agitation 3·25 grains of oil per ounce; which may be considered
the proportion in a saturated distilled water. The water contains,
according to Schubarth, only 0·25 per cent. of hydrocyanic acid;<a id='r1979' /><a href='#f1979' class='c013'><sup>[1979]</sup></a>
according to Schrader<a id='r1980' /><a href='#f1980' class='c013'><sup>[1980]</sup></a> only half as much; and by long keeping
even that small proportion will gradually disappear, as I have ascertained
by experiment. Hence its strength must vary greatly,—a
fact which will explain the very different effects of the same dose in
different instances.</p>

<p class='c006'>From experiments on animals by a great number of observers, it
appears that, whether it is introduced into the stomach, or into the
anus, or into the cellular tissue, or directly into a vein, it occasions
giddiness, palsy, insensibility, convulsions, coma, and speedy death;—that
the tetanic state brought on by the pure acid, is not always
so distinctly caused by cherry-laurel water;—and that tetanus is
most frequently induced by medium doses.</p>

<p class='c006'>The attention of physicians was first called to this poison by an
account, published by Dr. Madden in the Philosophical Transactions
for 1737, of several accidents which occurred at Dublin in consequence
of strong ratifia’d brandy having been prepared with it.
Foderé has also given an account of two cases, caused by servants
having stolen and drunk a bottle of it, which they mistook for a cordial.<a id='r1981' /><a href='#f1981' class='c013'><sup>[1981]</sup></a>
Being afraid of detection, they swallowed it quickly, and in
a few minutes expired in convulsions. Murray has noticed several
others in his Apparatus Medicaminum.<a id='r1982' /><a href='#f1982' class='c013'><sup>[1982]</sup></a> In most of these cases the
individuals suddenly lost their speech, fell down insensible, and died
in a few minutes. Convulsions do not appear to have been frequent.
Coullon has also related an instance where a child seems to have
been killed by the leaves applied to a large sore on the neck.<a id='r1983' /><a href='#f1983' class='c013'><sup>[1983]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_607'>607</span>The dose required to occasion these effects, and more especially
to prove fatal, has not been determined with care. It must vary
with the age of the sample used. It will vary also according as the
water has been filtered or not; for what is not filtered often presents
undissolved oil suspended in it or floating on its surface. One ounce
has proved fatal;<a id='r1984' /><a href='#f1984' class='c013'><sup>[1984]</sup></a> and half an ounce has caused only temporary giddiness,
loss of power over the limbs, stupor, and sense of pressure in
the stomach.<a id='r1985' /><a href='#f1985' class='c013'><sup>[1985]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The appearances found in the dead body have varied. In general
the blood has been fluid. The smell of bitter almond has commonly
been distinct in the stomach.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cherry-laurel water has attracted much attention in this country,
in consequence of being the poison used by Captain Donnellan
for the murder of Sir Theodosius Boughton. The trial of Donnellan,
the most important trial for poisoning which ever took place in Britain,
has given rise to some discrepance of opinion both among barristers
and medical men, as to the sufficiency of the evidence by
which the prisoner was condemned.<a id='r1986' /><a href='#f1986' class='c013'><sup>[1986]</sup></a> For my part, taking into account
the general, as well as medical circumstances of the case, I do
not entertain a doubt of his guilt.</p>

<p class='c006'>Leaving the general evidence out of view, however, as foreign to
the objects of the medical jurist’s regard, it must be admitted that
the medical evidence, taken by itself, was defective. It may be
summed up shortly in the following terms:—Sir Theodosius was a
young man of the age of twenty, and in perfect health, except that
he had a slight venereal complaint of old standing, for which he occasionally
took a laxative draught. On the morning of his death,
his mother, Lady Boughton, remarked, while giving him his draught,
that it had a strong smell of bitter almonds. Two minutes after he
took it, she observed a rattling or gurgling in his stomach; in ten
minutes more he seemed inclined to doze; and five minutes afterwards
she found him quite insensible, with the eyes fixed upwards,
the teeth locked, froth running out of his mouth, and a great heaving
at his stomach and gurgling in his throat. He died within half an
hour after swallowing the draught. The body was examined ten days
after death, and the inspectors found great congestion of the veins
every where, gorging of the lungs, and redness of the stomach. But
the examination was unskilfully conducted. For the head was not
opened; the fæces were allowed to rush from the intestines into the
stomach; and, as a great quantity of fluid blood was found in each
cavity of the chest, the subclavian veins must have been divided
during the separation of the clavicles. Very little reliance, therefore,
can be placed in the evidence from the inspection of the body.<a id='r1987' /><a href='#f1987' class='c013'><sup>[1987]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_608'>608</span>On comparing these particulars with what has been said above
regarding the effects of hydrocyanic acid and this whole genus of
poisons, it will be seen that every circumstance coincides precisely
with the supposition of poisoning with the cherry-laurel water. The
symptoms were exactly the same as in Mertzdoff’s case of poisoning
with the essential oil of almonds (p. <a href='#Page_604'>604</a>). When to this are added,
the smell of the draught, which Lady Boughton could hardly mistake,
the rarity of apoplexy in so young and healthy a person as Sir
Theodosius, and the improbability of either that or any other disease
of the head proving fatal so quickly,—the conclusion at which, in
my opinion, every sound medical jurist must arrive is, that poisoning
in the way supposed was very probable. But I cannot go along
with those who think that it was certain; nor is it possible to see on
what grounds such an opinion can be founded, when the general or
moral circumstances are excluded.</p>

<p class='c006'>The medical evidence in Donnellan’s case has been much canvassed,
and especially that of Mr. John Hunter. It would be foreign
to the plan hitherto pursued in this work to analyze and review what
was said by him and his brethren. But I must frankly observe, that Mr.
Hunter’s evidence does him very little credit, and that his high professional
eminence is the reverse of a reason for palliating his errors,
or treating them with the lenity which they have experienced from
his numerous critics.</p>

<h5 class='c011'><i>Of the Peach, Cluster-Cherry, Mountain-Ash, &amp;c.</i></h5>

<p class='c012'>Little need be said of the other plants formerly mentioned among
those which yield hydrocyanic acid, and act on the system in consequence
of containing that substance.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>Amygdalus persica</i> or peach is the most active of them. Most
parts of the plant exhale the odour of the bitter-almond, but particularly
the flowers and kernels. According to the chemical researches
of M. Gauthier, the fresh young shoots of the peach collected in July
contain, weight for weight, even more essential oil than the bitter
almond, or cherry-laurel leaves; for 250 grains yielded nearly five
grains of it or two per cent.; and he found the oil may be easily
procured by distilling the shoots without addition till the product begins
to pass over clear.<a id='r1988' /><a href='#f1988' class='c013'><sup>[1988]</sup></a> The kernels of the peach, when distilled
with water, yield nearly one grain of hydrocyanic acid per ounce.<a id='r1989' /><a href='#f1989' class='c013'><sup>[1989]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Coullon has collected two instances of poisoning with the peach-blossom.
One is the case of an elderly gentleman, who swallowed a
sallad of the flower to purge himself. Soon afterwards he was
seized with giddiness, violent purging, convulsions, and stupor; and
he died in three days. Here the poison must have proved fatal by
inducing true apoplexy in a predisposed habit; at least poisoning
with hydrocyanic acid never lasts nearly so long. The other, a child
eighteen months old, after taking a decoction of the flowers to destroy
worms, perished with frightful convulsions, efforts to vomit, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_609'>609</span>bloody diarrhœa.<a id='r1990' /><a href='#f1990' class='c013'><sup>[1990]</sup></a> The peach-blossom would therefore appear to be
rather a narcotico-acrid, than a narcotic.—Peach-leaves are represented
to have produced even purely irritant effects. A man, who
took a decoction of a handful boiled in a quart of water down to a
third,—when of course no hydrocyanic acid could remain,—was
attacked with tightness in the chest, a sense of suffocation, violent
colic, pain in the stomach and frequent desire to vomit, followed by
a hard pulse, restlessness, and flushing of the face. But he recovered
slowly under the use of fomentations and opiates.<a id='r1991' /><a href='#f1991' class='c013'><sup>[1991]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The bark of the <i>Prunus padus</i>, or cluster-cherry, a native of this
country, owes its poisonous qualities to the same substance as the
preceding plants. Heumann found that the distilled water obtained
from two ounces of bark in March contains two grains of acid, two ounces
of developed leaves half a grain, and two ounces of the seed a trifle
less.<a id='r1992' /><a href='#f1992' class='c013'><sup>[1992]</sup></a> Its distilled water has the odour of bitter almonds, contains
the same essential oil with that of the bitter almond, and yields more
hydrocyanic acid than the cherry-laurel water.<a id='r1993' /><a href='#f1993' class='c013'><sup>[1993]</sup></a> The oil, according
to Schrader, contains 9·25<a id='r1994' /><a href='#f1994' class='c013'><sup>[1994]</sup></a> per cent. of hydrocyanic acid, according
to Göppert only 5·5 per cent.<a id='r1995' /><a href='#f1995' class='c013'><sup>[1995]</sup></a> Bremer, who has examined this
plant with great care, found that both the distilled water and the
essential oil kill mice when put into the mouth, eye, nose, ear, anus,
or a wound; and that half an ounce of the water killed a dog in
twelve minutes.<a id='r1996' /><a href='#f1996' class='c013'><sup>[1996]</sup></a> The fruit is also poisonous. It has a nauseous
taste, but communicates a pleasant flavour to spirituous liquors. The
kernels yield by expression a transparent, fixed oil, concrete at 41°
F., which contains a small quantity of the essential oil; and the cake
which is left yields so much of the latter, that, as we are informed by
M. Chancel of Briançon, a handful has proved fatal to cows in a
short time.<a id='r1997' /><a href='#f1997' class='c013'><sup>[1997]</sup></a> In these kernels, as in the bitter almond, the essential
oil does not exist ready formed, but is developed only in consequence
of the contact of water; and hence, if the fixed oil by expression
contains a little of it, as Chancel says, this must arise from the kernels
having been moist when squeezed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>Sorbus aucuparia</i>, mountain-ash, or Rowan-tree as it is called
in Scotland, has been lately added to the list of plants which abound
in the same poisonous principle. M. Grassmann of St Petersburgh
has found that many parts of this tree, such as the flowers and the
bark of the trunk and branches, contain more or less of the peculiar
essential oil; and that the root in particular contains so much in the
month of May as to smell strongly of it when broken across, and to
yield a distilled water which holds fully as much hydrocyanic acid as
that procured from an equal weight of cherry-laurel leaves.<a id='r1998' /><a href='#f1998' class='c013'><sup>[1998]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_610'>610</span>Several other plants of the same natural order possess similar though
weaker properties, such as the <i>Prunus avium</i>, or black-cherry, or
mazzard, the <i>Prunus insititia</i>, or bullace, the <i>Prunus spinosa</i>, or sloe,
the <i>Amygdalus nana</i>, or dwarf-almond, and even the leaves and
kernels of the common cherry, the <i>Cerasus communis</i>. Twelve
ounces of cherry kernels distilled with water, yield, according to
Geiseler, seven grains of hydrocyanic acid.<a id='r1999' /><a href='#f1999' class='c013'><sup>[1999]</sup></a> I have no doubt, from
my experiments, that the seeds of <i>Pyrus malus</i>, the apple, <i>Pyrus aria</i>,
the white-beam, and also, if the taste may be taken for a criterion,
the whole seeds of the <i>Pomaceæ</i>, yield by distillation with water a
large quantity of hydrocyanic acid.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXX.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING WITH CARBAZOTIC ACID.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>A substance long known to chemists by the name of indigo-bitter,
which is procured by the action of nitric acid on indigo, silk, and
other azotized substances, and which has been found to consist chiefly
of a peculiar acid, termed by Liebig, from its composition, the carbazotic
acid, appears to be a pure narcotic poison of considerable activity.<a id='r2000' /><a href='#f2000' class='c013'><sup>[2000]</sup></a>
It is in the form of shining crystals, of an excessively bitter
taste, and of a yellow colour so singularly intense that it imparts a
perceptible tint to a million parts of water. The pure crystals are
composed of carbon, azote, and oxygen.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only account I have seen of the physiological properties of
this substance is a full analysis by Buchner in his Toxicology, of
some interesting experiments by Professor Rapp of Tübingen.<a id='r2001' /><a href='#f2001' class='c013'><sup>[2001]</sup></a> He
found that sixteen grains in solution, when introduced into the stomach,
killed a fox, ten grains a dog, and five grains a rabbit, in an
hour and a half; that the injection of a watery solution into the
windpipe occasioned death in a few minutes; that the introduction of
it into the cavity of the pleura or peritonæum occasioned death in
several hours; that a watery solution of ten grains injected into the
jugular vein of a fox killed it instantaneously, and in like manner
five grains affected a dog in three minutes and killed it in twenty-four
hours; and that thirty grains applied to a wound killed a rabbit.
The symptoms remarked from its introduction into the stomach of the
fox were in half an hour tremors, grinding of the teeth, constant contortion
of the eyes and convulsions, in an hour complete insensibility,
and death in half an hour more. In the dog there was also remarked
an attack of vomiting and feebleness of the pulse.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the dead body no particular alteration of structure was remarked.
The heart, examined immediately after death from the introduction
of the poison into the stomach, was found much gorged and motionless;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_611'>611</span>but the irritability of the voluntary muscles remained. The stomach
was not inflamed, but dyed yellow. A very interesting appearance
was dyeing of various textures and fluids throughout the body. In
the fox killed by swallowing sixteen grains the conjunctiva of the
eyes, the aqueous humour, the capsule of the lens, the membranes
of the arteries, in a less degree those of the veins, the lungs, and in
many places the cellular tissue, had acquired a lemon-yellow colour.
The dog killed in the same manner presented similar appearances,
also those killed by injection of the poison into the pleura or peritonæum;
and in the latter animals the urine was tinged yellow. In a
rabbit killed by the application of the poison to a wound the same discoloration
was also every where remarked, together with yellowness of
the fibrin of the blood. But no yellowness could be seen any where in
the dog, which died in twenty-four hours after receiving five grains
into the jugular vein. In no instance was there any yellow tint perceptible
in the brain or spinal cord.</p>

<p class='c006'>These facts form an interesting addition to the physiology of poisons.
They supply unequivocal proof that this substance is absorbed in the
course of its operation, and furnish strong presumption that other
poisons, which act on organs remote from the place where they are
applied, and which have been sought for without success in the blood,
as well as in other fluids and solids throughout the body, have not
been detected, merely because the physiologist does not possess such
simple and extremely delicate means of searching for them.</p>

<p class='c006'>The researches of Professor Rapp have been arranged under the
title of carbazotic acid, because this acid forms the most prominent
substance in the matter with which his experiments appear to have
been made. But it is right to state, that the article actually used
was, if I understand correctly the abstract given by Buchner, not the
pure crystals, but the yellow fluid, from which the crystals are procured,
and which contains also a resinous matter and artificial tannin.—The
bitter principle of Welther produced by the action of nitric
acid on silk, and that formed by Braconnot by the action of the same
acid on aloes, appear to be impure carbazotic acid.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXI.<br /> <span class='small'>OF THE POISONOUS GASES.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>The subject of the poisonous gases is one of great importance in
relation to medical police, as well as medical jurisprudence. They
are objects of interest to the medical jurist, because their effects may
be mistaken for those of criminal violence, and because they have
even been resorted to for committing suicide. They are interesting
as a topic of medical police, since some trades expose the workmen
to their influence.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has hitherto been chiefly on the continent that use has been
made of the deleterious gases for the purpose of self-destruction.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_612'>612</span>Osiander mentions, that Lebrun, a famous player on the horn, suffocated
himself at Paris in 1809 with the fumes of sulphur; and that
an apothecary at Pyrmont killed himself by going into the <i>Grotto
del Cane</i> there, which, like that near Naples, is filled with carbonic
acid gas.<a id='r2002' /><a href='#f2002' class='c013'><sup>[2002]</sup></a> Many instances have lately occurred in France of suicide
caused by the emanations from burning charcoal in a close chamber.</p>

<p class='c006'>But these poisons come under the notice of the medical jurist
chiefly because their effects may be mistaken for those of other kinds
of violent death. Several mistakes of this nature are on record.
Zacchias mentions the case of a man, who was found dead in prison
under circumstances which led to the suspicion, that he had been
privately strangled by the governor. But Zacchias proved this to be
impossible, and ascribed death to the fumes from a choffer of burning
charcoal left in the room.<a id='r2003' /><a href='#f2003' class='c013'><sup>[2003]</sup></a> A more striking instance of the kind
occurred a few years ago at London. A woman, who inhabited a
room with other five people, alarmed the neighbours one morning
with the intelligence that all her fellow-lodgers were dead. On entering
the room they found two men and two women actually dead,
and another man quite insensible and apparently dying. This man,
however, recovered; and as it was said that he was too intimate with
the woman who gave the alarm, a report was spread that she had
poisoned the rest, to get rid of the man’s wife, one of the sufferers.
She was accordingly put in prison, various articles in the house were
carefully analysed for poison, and an account of the supposed barbarous
murder was hawked about the streets. At last the man who
recovered remembered having put a choffer of coals between the two
beds, which held the whole six people; and the chamber having no
vent, they had thus been all suffocated.<a id='r2004' /><a href='#f2004' class='c013'><sup>[2004]</sup></a>—The following is a similar
accident not less remarkable in its circumstances. Four people in
<i>Gerolzhofen</i> in Bavaria, were found one morning in bed, some dead,
others comatose; and only one recovered. A neighbour who had
supped with them, but slept at home, did not suffer. The stomach
and intestines were found very red and black; and the coats of the
stomach brittle. The contents of the stomach, the remains of their
supper, and the wine were analysed without any suspicious substance
being found. A little smoke having been noticed in the room by
those who first entered it, the stove and fuel were examined, but
without furnishing any insight into the cause of the accident. At
last the cellar was examined, and then it was found that one of the
sufferers had heated a copper vessel there so incautiously, that the fire
communicated with the unplastered planks of the floor above. The
planks had burnt with a low smothered flame, and the vapours passed
through the crevices in the floor.<a id='r2005' /><a href='#f2005' class='c013'><sup>[2005]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>What Irrespirable Gases are Poisonous?</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Some gases act negatively on the animal system by preventing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_613'>613</span>access of respirable air to the lungs; others are positively poisonous.
The first point, therefore, is to ascertain which are negatively, and
which positively hurtful.</p>

<p class='c006'>M. Nysten, who has made the most connected train of experiments
on this subject, conceived that a gas will not act through any other
channel besides the lungs, if it exerts merely a negative action:—and
that, on the contrary, it certainly possesses a direct and positive
power, if it has nearly the same effects, in whatever way it is introduced
into the body.<a id='r2006' /><a href='#f2006' class='c013'><sup>[2006]</sup></a> He therefore thought the best way to ascertain
the action of the gases would be, to inject them into the blood,—conceiving
that, after allowance is made for the mere mechanical
effects of an aëriform body, the phenomena would point out the true
operation of each.</p>

<p class='c006'>His first object then was to learn what phenomena are caused by
the mechanical action of atmospheric air. He found that four cubic
inches and a half, injected into the jugular vein of a dog, killed it
immediately amidst tetanic convulsions, by distending the heart with
frothy blood;—that a larger quantity introduced, gradually caused
more lingering death, with symptoms of oppressed breathing, which
arose from gorging of the lungs with frothy blood;—and that a
small quantity, injected into the carotid artery towards the brain,
occasioned speedy death by apoplexy, which arose from the brain
being deprived by means of the air of a due supply of its proper
stimulus, the blood. Numerous experimental inquiries have been
since made on this subject, the latest of which, those of Dr. Cormack,
coincide with the first results of Nysten, that air injected into the
veins causes death by arrestment of the action of the heart.<a id='r2007' /><a href='#f2007' class='c013'><sup>[2007]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Proceeding with these data, Nysten found that <i>oxygen</i> and <i>azote</i>
had the same effect when apart, as when united in the form of atmospheric
air; that <i>carburetted hydrogen</i>, <i>hydrogen</i>, <i>carbonic oxide</i>,
and <i>phosphuretted hydrogen</i> likewise seemed to act in the same way;
and that the <i>nitrous oxide</i>, or intoxicating gas, although it does not
cause so much mechanical injury as the others, on account of its
superior solubility in the blood, has the same effect when injected in
sufficient quantity, and produces little or none of the symptoms of
intoxication excited by it in man.<a id='r2008' /><a href='#f2008' class='c013'><sup>[2008]</sup></a> As to <i>carbonic acid gas</i>, he found
that, on account of its great solubility in the blood, it is difficult to
produce mechanical injury with it; that sixty-four cubic inches are
absorbed, and do not excite any particular symptoms; but that when
injected into the carotid artery, it occasions death by apoplexy, although
it is rapidly absorbed by the blood.<a id='r2009' /><a href='#f2009' class='c013'><sup>[2009]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The other gases he tried were hydrosulphuric acid, nitric oxide,
ammonia and chlorine; and all of these proved to be positively and
highly deleterious.</p>

<p class='c006'>Two or three cubic inches of <i>hydrosulphuric acid gas</i> caused tetanus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_614'>614</span>and immediate death, when injected into the veins, although the
gas was at once absorbed by the blood. The same quantity acted
with almost equal rapidity when injected into the cavity of the chest.
Similar results were obtained when it was injected into the cellular
tissue, or even when it was left for some time in contact with the
sound skin.<a id='r2010' /><a href='#f2010' class='c013'><sup>[2010]</sup></a> The last important fact has been since confirmed by
Lebküchner in his Thesis on the permeability of the tissues;<a id='r2011' /><a href='#f2011' class='c013'><sup>[2011]</sup></a> and it
had previously been observed also by the late Professor Chaussier,
whose experiments will be mentioned presently (p. <a href='#Page_617'>617</a>). In none
of Nysten’s experiments with this gas was the blood changed in
appearance.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Nitric oxide gas</i>, according to Nysten, is the most energetic of all
the poisonous gases. A very small quantity causes death by tetanus,
when introduced into a vein, the cavity of the chest, or the cellular
tissue; and it always changes the state of the blood, giving it a
chocolate-brown colour, and preventing its coagulation. In one of
Nysten’s experiments a cubic inch and three-quarters injected into
the chest killed a little dog in 45 minutes.<a id='r2012' /><a href='#f2012' class='c013'><sup>[2012]</sup></a> Dr. John Davy appears
to have found this gas not so active.<a id='r2013' /><a href='#f2013' class='c013'><sup>[2013]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Nysten found the two other gases, <i>ammonia</i> and <i>chlorine</i>, to be
acrid in their action. When injected into the veins they kill by
over-stimulating the heart; and when injected into the cavity of the
chest, they excite inflammation in the lining membrane.<a id='r2014' /><a href='#f2014' class='c013'><sup>[2014]</sup></a> Hébréart
farther remarked in his experiments relative to the action of irritants
on the windpipe, that chlorine when inspired, produces violent inflammation
in the windpipe and its great branches, ending in the
secretion of a pseudo-membrane like that of croup;<a id='r2015' /><a href='#f2015' class='c013'><sup>[2015]</sup></a> and that a very
small quantity of ammonia has the same effect.</p>

<p class='c006'>From this abstract of Nysten’s researches, it appears to follow, that
ammonia and chlorine are irritants; hydrosulphuric acid and nitric
oxide, narcotics; oxygen, azote, hydrogen, carburetted hydrogen,
phosphuretted hydrogen, carbonic oxide, and nitrous oxide, negative
poisons; and carbonic acid, doubtful in its nature. Some of these
conclusions do not correspond with the effects observed in man;
which will presently be found to lead to the inference, that not only
carbonic acid, but likewise carbonic oxide, nitrous oxide, and carburetted
hydrogen are narcotics. The reason Nysten did not find
these gases injurious was probably, that, before they could pass from
the vein into which they were injected, to the brain on which they
act, they were in a great measure exhaled from the lungs. The experiments
of physiologists since Nysten’s time likewise tend to show
that oxygen gas is a positive poison when pure, and that even hydrogen
possesses active properties. The inquiries of Mr. Broughton
led him to consider hydrogen a positive poison, because animals die
in it in half a minute, and the heart immediately after death is found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_615'>615</span>to have lost its contractility. Previous experimentalists had also
remarked hypnotic effects from the inhalation of it diluted with
oxygen.<a id='r2016' /><a href='#f2016' class='c013'><sup>[2016]</sup></a> As to oxygen, the same physiologist ascertained that when
pure, it is a narcotic poison, though a feeble one, as at least five
hours of continuous respiration in the pure gas are required to
prove fatal.<a id='r2017' /><a href='#f2017' class='c013'><sup>[2017]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of the Effects of the Poisonous Gases on Man.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>According to the effects of the poisonous gases on man, they may
be arranged in two groups, the first including the <i>irritants</i>, the second
the <i>narcotics</i>. It might have been therefore a more philosophical
mode of arrangement, if the former had been considered under
the irritant class of poisons; but it is more convenient to examine
the whole deleterious gases together.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>irritant gases</i> are nitric oxide gas and nitrous acid vapour,
hydrochloric acid gas, chlorine, ammonia, sulphurous acid, and some
others of little consequence.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of Nitric oxide gas and Nitrous acid vapour.</i>—Before nitric oxide
gas can be breathed in ordinary circumstances, it is transformed by
the oxygen of the air into nitrous acid vapour, of a ruddy colour and
irritating odour. Hébréart found that in animals killed by inhaling
it the windpipe was much inflamed.<a id='r2018' /><a href='#f2018' class='c013'><sup>[2018]</sup></a> Sir H. Davy tried to inhale
it, and with this view took the precaution of previously breathing
the nitrous oxide or intoxicating gas, in order to expel the atmospheric
air as much as possible from his lungs. But he found that
the small quantity of nitrous acid fumes formed with the remaining
air was sufficient to cause a sense of burning in the throat, and at
once stimulated the glottis to contract, so that none of the nitric
oxide gas could pass into the larynx. The subsequent entrance of
the external air into the mouth, which Sir Humphrey unluckily had
not provided for, was of course attended by the immediate formation
of more acid fumes, by which his tongue, cheeks, and gums, were
irritated and inflamed; and there is no doubt, as Sir Humphrey
himself remarks, that if he had succeeded in inhaling the nitric oxide
gas, the same chemical change would have happened in the lungs
and excited pneumonia.<a id='r2019' /><a href='#f2019' class='c013'><sup>[2019]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The following cases will prove that nitrous acid vapour, disengaged
from the fuming nitrous acid, is a very violent and dangerous
poison when inhaled. A chemical manufacturer, in endeavouring to
remove from his store-room a hamper in which some bottles of nitrous
acid had burst, breathed the fumes for some time, and was seized in
four hours with symptoms of inflammation in the throat and stomach.
At night the urine was suppressed; the skin then became blue; at
last he was seized with hiccup, acute pain in the diaphragm, convulsions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_616'>616</span>and delirium; and he died twenty-seven hours after the
accident.<a id='r2020' /><a href='#f2020' class='c013'><sup>[2020]</sup></a> Another case has been described in the Bulletins of the
Medical Society of Emulation. It proved fatal in two days, and the
symptoms were those of violent pneumonia. In this instance there
was pneumonia of one side, and pleurisy of the other; the uvula and
throat were gangrenous, and the windpipe and air-tubes dark-red;
the veins throughout the whole body were much congested, the skin
very livid in many places, and the blood fluid in the heart, but
coagulated in the vessels.<a id='r2021' /><a href='#f2021' class='c013'><sup>[2021]</sup></a> Dr. Reitz, a writer in Henke’s Journal,
met with two cases of death from the same cause in hatters. They
had incautiously exposed themselves too much to the fumes, which
are disengaged during the preparation of nitrate of mercury for the
operation of felting, and which are well known to be nitric oxide
gas converted into nitrous acid vapour by contact with the air. Two
men died of inflammation of the lungs excited in that manner; and
a third, a boy of fourteen, after sleeping all night in an apartment
where the mixture was effervescing, was attacked in the morning
with yellowness of the skin, giddiness, and colic, which ended fatally
in six days.<a id='r2022' /><a href='#f2022' class='c013'><sup>[2022]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of Poisoning with Chlorine.</i>—The experiments of Nysten and
Hébréart with chlorine, and its well-known irritating effects when
inhaled in the minutest quantities, show that it will produce inflammation
of the lungs and air-passages. The following is the only
instance of poisoning with it in man which has come under my notice.
A young man, after breathing diluted chlorine as an experiment, was
instantly seized with violent irritation in the epiglottis, windpipe,
and bronchial branches, cough, tightness, and sense of pressure in
the chest, inability to swallow, great difficulty in breathing or articulating,
discharge of mucus from the mouth and nostrils, severe
sneezing, swelling of the face, and protrusion of the eyes. Ammonia
was of no use; but singular relief was obtained from the inhalation
of a little sulphuretted hydrogen, so that in an hour and a half he
was tolerably well.<a id='r2023' /><a href='#f2023' class='c013'><sup>[2023]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Although this gas is very irritating to an unaccustomed person,
yet by the force of habit one may breathe with impunity an atmosphere
much loaded with it. I have been told by a chemical manufacturer
at Belfast, that his men can work in an atmosphere of chlorine,
where he himself could not remain above a few minutes. The
chief consequences of habitual exposure are acidity and other stomach
complaints, which the men generally correct by taking chalk. He
has likewise observed that they never become corpulent, and that
corpulent men who become workmen are soon reduced to an ordinary
size. It is not probable, however, that the trade is an unhealthy
one; for several of this gentleman’s workmen have lived to an advanced
age; one man, who died not long ago at the age of eighty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_617'>617</span>had been forty years in the manufactory; and I have seen in Mr.
Tenant’s manufactory at Glasgow a healthy-looking man who had
been also about forty years a workman there. It is an interesting
fact, that during the epidemic fever which raged over Ireland from
1816 to 1819, the people at the manufactory at Belfast were exempt
from it.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of Poisoning with Ammonia.</i>—For an account of the effects of
<i>ammonia</i>, which, when in the state of gas, acts violently as an irritant
on the mouth, windpipe, and lungs, the reader is referred to the
chapter on ammonia and its salts in page <a href='#Page_193'>193</a>. It appears to form
one of the gases disengaged from the soil of necessaries, as will be
noticed presently, and excites inflammation in the eyes of workmen
who are incautiously exposed to it.<a id='r2024' /><a href='#f2024' class='c013'><sup>[2024]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of Poisoning with Hydrochloric Acid Gas.</i>—I have not met with
any account of the effects of <i>hydrochloric acid gas</i> on man. But no
doubt can be entertained that it will likewise act as a violent and
pure irritant.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is exceedingly hurtful to vegetable life. In the course of some
experiments performed in 1827 by Dr. Turner and myself on the
effects of various gases on plants, we found that a tenth of a cubic
inch diluted with 20,000 times its volume of air, so as to be quite
imperceptible to the nostrils, shrivelled and killed all the leaves of
various plants, which were exposed to it for twenty-four hours.<a id='r2025' /><a href='#f2025' class='c013'><sup>[2025]</sup></a>
These experiments were repeated in 1832 by Messrs. Rogerson, apparently
in ignorance of them. Their results are on the whole the
same; and the slighter effect obtained by them from minute proportions
of the gas was evidently owing to the small size of their glass-jars
not allowing them to use a sufficient quantity of it.<a id='r2026' /><a href='#f2026' class='c013'><sup>[2026]</sup></a> They
farther found that proportions of hydrochloric acid gas, amounting to
a twentieth of the air, kill small animals in half an hour with symptoms
of obstructed respiration. Their experiments with less proportions
are not precise, yet warrant the inference that even a thousandth
part of the gas will probably prove fatal in no long time.<a id='r2027' /><a href='#f2027' class='c013'><sup>[2027]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of Poisoning with Hydrosulphuric Acid Gas.</i>—The <i>narcotic gases</i>
are of much greater importance than the irritants, on account of the
singularity of their effects, and the greater frequency of accidents
with them. This group includes hydrosulphuric acid, carburetted-hydrogen,
carbonic acid, carbonic oxide, nitrous oxide, cyanogen,
and oxygen.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hydrosulphuric acid gas is probably the most deleterious of all the
gases. According to Thenard and Dupuytren, air containing only
an 800th of it will kill small birds in a few seconds; and a 290th
is sufficient to kill a dog; which, however, will sustain so much as a
400th.<a id='r2028' /><a href='#f2028' class='c013'><sup>[2028]</sup></a> Chaussier previously found, that a horse was killed by
breathing atmospheric air which contained a 250th of hydrosulphuric
<span class='pageno' id='Page_618'>618</span>acid gas; and that it acts with energy on animals, whether it be inhaled,
or injected into the stomach, anus, or cellular tissue, or even
simply applied to the skin. Nine quarts of the gas injected into the
anus of a horse killed it in one minute; and a rabbit, whose skin
alone was exposed to it, died in ten minutes.<a id='r2029' /><a href='#f2029' class='c013'><sup>[2029]</sup></a> Ulterior inquiries by
MM. Parent-Duchâtelet and Gaultier de Claubry,—scarcely so precise
however as those of their predecessors,—appear to lead to the
conclusion, that its energy is in some circumstances not so great.
While superintending the clearing out of some of the choked drains
of Paris, they found that the workmen suffered no harm, though they
habitually breathed an atmosphere containing from 25 to 80 ten-thousandths
of hydrosulphuric acid gas, and on some occasions even
so much as one per cent.; nay, on one occasion Gaultier remained
several minutes without injury, collecting air for chemical analysis
in an atmosphere, which proved to be loaded with three per cent. of
the gas.<a id='r2030' /><a href='#f2030' class='c013'><sup>[2030]</sup></a> None of these researches point out the precise manner of
death. Dr. Percy of Nottingham informs me he found in 1839,
that dogs, which breathed air, containing this gas, quickly died in
convulsions like those caused by hydrocyanic acid; that in some
instances the heart’s action was observed to have ceased, when
the body was opened immediately after death; but that in general
it either continued to beat for some time, or could be made to do so
when its state of congestion was relieved by withdrawing a little
blood.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Turner and I found that hydrosulphuric acid gas is very injurious
to vegetables, and that it acts differently from muriatic acid
gas, as it appeared to exhaust the vitality of plants and to cause in
them a state analogous to narcotic poisoning in animals. Four cubic
inches and a half, diluted with eighty volumes of air, caused drooping
of the leaves of a mignonette plant in twenty-four hours; and
the plant, though then removed into the open air, continued to droop
till it bent over altogether and died.<a id='r2031' /><a href='#f2031' class='c013'><sup>[2031]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The best description of the effects of this gas on man has been
given by M. Hallé,<a id='r2032' /><a href='#f2032' class='c013'><sup>[2032]</sup></a> in his account of the nature and effects of the
exhalations from the pits of the Parisian necessaries; which exhalations
appear, from the experiments of Thenard and Dupuytren, to
be mixtures chiefly of ammonia and sulphuretted-hydrogen. The
symptoms, in cases where the vapours are breathed in a state of concentration,
are sudden weakness and all the signs of ordinary asphyxia.
The individual becomes suddenly weak and insensible; falls down;
and either expires immediately, or, if he is fortunate enough to be
quickly extricated, he may revive in no long time, the belly remaining
tense and full for an hour or upwards, and recovery being
preceded by vomiting and hawking of bloody froth.<a id='r2033' /><a href='#f2033' class='c013'><sup>[2033]</sup></a> When the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_619'>619</span>noxious emanations are less concentrated, several affections have
been noticed, which may be reduced to two varieties, the one consisting
of pure coma, the other of coma and tetanic convulsions. In
the comatose form, the workman seems to fall gently asleep while at
work, is roused with difficulty, and has no recollection afterwards of
what passed before the accident. The convulsive form is sometimes
preceded by noisy and restless delirium, sometimes by sudden faintness,
heaving or pain in the stomach, and pains in the arms, and almost
always by difficult breathing, from weakness in the muscles of
the chest. Insensibility, and a state resembling asphyxia rapidly succeed,
during which the pupil is fixed and dilated, the mouth filled
with white or bloody froth, the skin cold, and the pulse feeble and
irregular. At last convulsive efforts to breathe ensue; these are
followed by general tetanic spasms of the trunk and extremities; and
if the case is to prove fatal, which it may not do for two hours, a
state of calm and total insensibility precedes death for a short interval.<a id='r2034' /><a href='#f2034' class='c013'><sup>[2034]</sup></a>
When the exposure has been too slight to cause serious
mischief, the individual is affected with sickness, colic, imperfectly
defined pains in the chest, and lethargy.<a id='r2035' /><a href='#f2035' class='c013'><sup>[2035]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The appearances in the bodies of persons killed by these emanations
are fluidity and blackness of the blood, a dark tint of all the
internal vascular organs, annihilation of the contractility of the muscles,
more or less redness of the bronchial tubes, and secretion of
brown mucus there as well as in the nostrils, gorging of the lungs, an
odour throughout the whole viscera like that of decayed fish, and a
tendency to early putrefaction.<a id='r2036' /><a href='#f2036' class='c013'><sup>[2036]</sup></a> Chaussier in his experiments also
remarked in animals, that when a plate of silver or bit of white lead
was thrust under the skin it was blackened.<a id='r2037' /><a href='#f2037' class='c013'><sup>[2037]</sup></a> Dr. Percy could not
detect the gas in the brain of animals killed by inhaling it.</p>

<p class='c006'>These extraordinary accidents may be occasioned not only by exposure
to the vapours from the <i>fosses</i>, but likewise by the incautious
inhalation of the vapours proceeding from the bodies of persons who
have been asphyxiated there. Sickness, colic, and pains in the
chest, are often caused in the latter mode; and Hallé has even given
an instance of the most violent form of the convulsive affection having
originated in the same manner.<a id='r2038' /><a href='#f2038' class='c013'><sup>[2038]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In order that the reader may comprehend the exact cause of these
accidents,—as it is not easy for an Englishman to comprehend how
suffocation may arise from the fumes of a privy,—it may be necessary
to explain, that in Paris the pipe of the privy terminates under
ground in a pit, which is usually contained in a small covered vault,
or is at the bottom of a small square tower open at the roof of the
house; and that the pit is often several feet long, wide and deep.
Here the filth is sometimes allowed to accumulate for a great length
of time, till the pit is full; and it is in the process of clearing it out
that the workmen are liable to suffer. Hallé has given an interesting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_620'>620</span>narrative of an attempt made to empty one of these pits in presence
of the Duc. de Rochefoucault, the Abbé Tessier, himself, and
other members of the Academy of Sciences, who were appointed by
the French government to examine into the merits of a pretended
discovery for destroying the noxious vapours. The pit chosen was
ten feet and a half long, six wide, and at least seven deep; and repeated
attempts had been previously made without success to empty
it. For some time the process went on prosperously; when at last
one of the workmen dropped his bucket into the pit. A ladder
being procured, he immediately proceeded to descend, and would
not wait to be tied with ropes. “But hardly,” says Hallé, “had he
descended a few steps of the ladder, when he tumbled down without
a cry, and was overwhelmed in the ordure below, without making
the slightest effort to save himself. It was at first thought he had
slipped his foot, and another workman promptly offered to descend
for him. This man was secured with ropes in case of accident. But
scarcely had he descended far enough to have his whole person in
the pit except his head, when he uttered a suppressed cry, made a
violent effort with his chest, slipped from the ladder, and ceased to
move or breathe. His head hung down on his breast, the pulse was
gone; and his complete state of asphyxia was the affair of a moment.
Another workman, descending with the same precautions,
fainted away in like manner, but was so promptly withdrawn that the
asphyxia was not complete, and he soon revived. At last a stout
young man, secured in the same way as the rest, also went down a
few steps. Finding himself seized like his companions, he re-ascended
to recover himself for a moment; and still not discouraged,
he resolved to go down again, and descended backwards, keeping
his face uppermost, so that he was able to search for his companion
with a hook and withdraw the body.” It was impossible to go on
with the operation of clearing out; and the pit was shut up again.
The first workman never showed any sign of life; the second recovered
after discharging much bloody froth; all the persons in the
vault were more or less affected; and a gentleman who, in trying to
resuscitate the dead workman, incautiously breathed the exhalations
from his mouth, was immediately and violently seized with the convulsive
form of the affection.<a id='r2039' /><a href='#f2039' class='c013'><sup>[2039]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The same kind of accident has been observed at Paris in the
vaults of cemeteries, owing to the same cause,—the disengagement
of hydrosulphuric acid and hydrosulphate of ammonia during putrefaction.
A remarkable instance is related by Guérard.<a id='r2040' /><a href='#f2040' class='c013'><sup>[2040]</sup></a> Analogous
accidents have happened in this country in clearing out drains.</p>

<p class='c006'>In none of the French investigations on this singular subject has
any allusion been made to the question, whether the health sustains
any injury from long-continued exposure to the gas in very minute
proportion. It is probably injurious however. At one time, while
in the practice of not using any precautions against inhaling the gas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_621'>621</span>in chemical researches, I used to remark that daily exposure to it in
minute quantity caused in a few weeks an extraordinary lassitude,
languor of the pulse, and defective appetite. Strohmeyer in the like
circumstances was liable to severe headache. Mr. Taylor says that
the workmen in the Thames Tunnel suffered severely for some time
from a similar exposure. Many of them became affected with giddiness,
sickness, general debility and emaciation, then with a low
fever attended with delirium, and in the course of a few months several
died. No cause could be discovered for their illness except
the frequent escape of sulphuretted-hydrogen from the roof. The
affection only disappeared, when the communication from bank to
bank was completed, so that the tunnel could be thoroughly ventilated.<a id='r2041' /><a href='#f2041' class='c013'><sup>[2041]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The presence of hydrosulphuric acid in all such emanations is
best proved by exposing to them a bit of filtering paper moistened
with a solution of lead. The smell alone must not be relied on, as
putrescent animal matter exhales an odour like that of hydrosulphuric
acid, though none be present. Workmen ought to be aware
that hydrosulphuric acid may be quickly fatal where lights burn
with undiminished brilliancy; and that in places where it is apt to
accumulate, the degree of purity of the air may vary so much in the
course of working, as to be wholesome only a few minutes before,
as well as a few minutes after a fatal accident.<a id='r2042' /><a href='#f2042' class='c013'><sup>[2042]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In the present place, some notice may be taken of an extraordinary
accident, which happened in 1831 near London. Great doubts
may be entertained whether hydrosulphuric acid was the cause of
it; and while these exist, it is not possible to arrange it under a
proper head. It is too important, however, in relation to Medical
Jurisprudence, to be omitted in this work; and I take the opportunity
of mentioning it here, as the accident was ascribed to hydrosulphuric
acid by those who witnessed it.</p>

<p class='c006'>In August, 1831, twenty-two boys living at a boarding-school at
Clapham were seized in the course of three or four hours with
alarming symptoms of violent irritation in the stomach and bowels,
subsultus of the muscles of the arms, and excessive prostration of
strength. Another had been similarly attacked three days before.
This child died in twenty-five, and one of the others in twenty-three
hours. On examination after death, the Peyerian glands of
the intestines were found in the former case enlarged, and as it were
tuberculated; in the other there were also ulcers of the mucous coat
of the small intestines, and softening of that coat in the colon. A
suspicion of accidental poisoning having naturally arisen, the various
utensils and articles of food used by the family were examined but
without success. And the only circumstance which appeared to
explain the accident was, that two days before the first child took
ill, a foul cess-pool had been opened, and the materials diffused over
a garden adjoining to the children’s play-ground. This was considered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_622'>622</span>a sufficient cause of the disease by Dr. Spurgin and Messrs.
Angus and Saunders of Clapham, as well as by Drs. Latham and
Chambers, and Mr. Pearson of London, who personally examined
the whole particulars.<a id='r2043' /><a href='#f2043' class='c013'><sup>[2043]</sup></a> Their explanation may be the only rational
account that can be given of the matter. But as no detail of their
chemical inquiries was ever published, their opinion cannot be received
with confidence by the medical jurist and the physician;
since it is not supported, so far as I am aware by any previous account
of the effects of hydrosulphuric acid gas.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of Poisoning with Carburetted Hydrogen.</i>—Of the several species
of carburetted hydrogen gas it is probable that all are more or
less narcotic; but they are much inferior in energy to sulphuretted
hydrogen.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sir H. Davy found that when he breathed a mixture of two parts
of air and three of carburetted hydrogen, procured from the decomposition
of water by red-hot charcoal, he was attacked with giddiness,
headache, and transient weakness of the limbs. When he
breathed it pure, the first inspiration caused a sense of numbness in
the muscles of the chest; the second caused an overpowering sense
of oppression in the breast, and insensibility to external objects;
during the third he seemed sinking into annihilation, and the mouthpiece
dropped out of his hand. On becoming again sensible, which
happened in less than a minute, he continued for some time to suffer
from a feeling of impending suffocation, extreme exhaustion, and
great feebleness of the pulse. Throughout the rest of the day he
was affected with weakness, giddiness and rending headache.<a id='r2044' /><a href='#f2044' class='c013'><sup>[2044]</sup></a>
These experiments show that the gas is deleterious. Yet Nysten
found it inert when injected into the veins, and what is more to the
point, colliers breathe the air of coal mines without apparent injury
when strongly impregnated with it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The mixed gases of coal-gas or oil-gas appear likewise to be inert
when considerably diluted; for gas-men breathe with impunity an
atmosphere considerably loaded with them; and in the course of
some researches on the illuminating power and best mode of burning
these gases, Dr. Turner and myself daily, for two months, breathed
air strongly impregnated with them, but never remarked any unpleasant
effect whatever.</p>

<p class='c006'>It would seem, however, from several accidents in France and
England, that when the impregnation is carried a certain length,
poisonous effects may ensue; and that the symptoms then induced
are purely narcotic. The first case, which occurred at Paris in 1830,
has been related by M. Devergie. In consequence of a leak in the
service-pipe which supplied a warehouse, five individuals who slept
in the house were attacked during the night with stupor; and if one
of them had not been awakened by the smell and alarmed the rest,
it is probable that all would have perished. As it was, one man
was found completely comatose and occasionally convulsed, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_623'>623</span>froth issuing from the mouth, occasional vomiting, stertorous respiration,
and dilated pupils. Some temporary amendment was procured
by blood-letting, but the breathing continued laborious, and
he expired about nine hours after the party went to bed, and six
hours after the alarm was given. On dissection the vessels of the
brain were found much gorged, the blood in the heart and great
vessels firmly coagulated, one of the lungs congested, and its bronchial
tube blocked up by a kidney bean. The immediate cause of
death in this case is therefore doubtful.<a id='r2045' /><a href='#f2045' class='c013'><sup>[2045]</sup></a> A similar set of cases happened
at Leeds in 1838. An old woman and her grand-daughter
were found dead in bed one morning at nine o’clock, ten hours and
a half after they had been seen alive and well. The air of the
apartment was loaded with coal-gas from a leak in a street-pipe ten
feet from the bedroom. One body was cold and stiff when found,
and the other became rigid very soon. The attitude and expression
were calm, the integuments pale, the cerebral membranes natural,
the brain itself turgid, and its ventricles distended, in the case of
the girl, with an ounce and a half of serosity, the lungs congested,
the alimentary mucous membrane red, and the blood every where
fluid, and unusually florid, even in the right side of the heart.<a id='r2046' /><a href='#f2046' class='c013'><sup>[2046]</sup></a> Another
accident of the same kind, which proved fatal to five individuals,
occurred at Strasbourg in 1841. Four were found dead, another
survived twenty-four hours after the accident was discovered,
and a sixth recovered. It appears from the statement of this person,
that the first symptoms were headache and giddiness, then nausea
and vomiting, afterwards confusion of ideas, and at length insensibility.
General prostration, partial palsy, coma, and convulsions
were the leading symptoms after the accident was observed. In the
four people found dead the most remarkable appearances were cerebral
congestion, redness of the bronchial membrane, accumulation
of bloody, frothy mucus in the air tubes, scarlet redness of the lungs,
coagulation and darkness of the blood. In the person who was
found alive, but did not recover, there was no cerebral congestion,
gorging of the air tubes, or redness of the lungs. Professor Tourdes,
who reports these cases, ascertained that air containing a fiftieth of
coal-gas kills rabbits in twelve or fourteen minutes, and that even a
thirtieth proves fatal, though slowly. The gas which caused the accident,
and which was prepared from a mixture of water and slate
coal, consisted of 22·5 per cent. light carburetted hydrogen, 6·0
bicarburetted hydrogen, 21·9 carbonic oxide, 31 hydrogen, 14 azote,
and 4·6 carbonic acid; and by experiment the author found that the
most energetic of these gases as a poison is the carbonic oxide, and
that the action of the two carburetted-hydrogens is quite feeble.<a id='r2047' /><a href='#f2047' class='c013'><sup>[2047]</sup></a> It
is somewhat remarkable that no such accident has ever happened in
Edinburgh, where nevertheless coal-gas is more used for purposes of
illumination in private houses than in any other city. The fine quality
of the gas,—for it contains a mere trace of carbonic acid, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_624'>624</span>probably less than four per cent. of carbonic oxide,—may be the
reason why accidents are not occasioned by it. It is a singular fact,
however, that the powerful odour of the gas, when it accidentally
escapes in the night-time, generally awakes very soon those who are
exposed to inhale it.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of Poisoning with Carbonic Acid Gas.</i>—Carbonic acid gas is the
most important of the deleterious gases; for it is the daily source of
fatal accidents. It is extricated in great quantity from burning fuel;
it is given out abundantly in the calcining of lime; it is disengaged
in a state of considerable purity in brew-houses by the fermentation
of beer; it is often met with in mines and caverns, particularly in
coal-pits and draw-wells; it may collect in apartments where fuel is
burnt without a proper outlet for the vitiated air, or where persons
are crowded too much for the capacity of the room. Hence many
have been killed by descending incautiously into draw-wells, by
falling into beer-vats, and by sleeping before the traps of lime-kilns,
or in apartments without vents and heated by choffers. Instances
have even occurred of the same accident from sleeping in greenhouses
during the night, when plants exhale much carbonic acid;
and some dreadful cases have occurred of suffocation from confinement
in small crowded rooms.</p>

<p class='c006'>Physiologists, as already remarked, are not quite agreed as to the
action of carbonic acid gas,—whether it is a positive poison, or
simply an asphyxiating gas. But in my opinion reasons enough exist
for believing that it is positively and energetically poisonous.
This is perhaps shown by its effects being much more rapidly produced,
and much more slowly and imperfectly removed, than asphyxia
from immersion in hydrogen or azote.<a id='r2048' /><a href='#f2048' class='c013'><sup>[2048]</sup></a> Thus immersion for
twenty-five seconds in an atmosphere of carbonic acid gas has been
found sufficient to kill an animal outright; and fifteen seconds will
kill a small bird.<a id='r2049' /><a href='#f2049' class='c013'><sup>[2049]</sup></a> But it is more unequivocally established by the
three following facts:</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first place, if, instead of the nitrogen contained in atmospheric
air, carbonic acid gas be mixed with oxygen in the same proportion,
animals cannot breathe this atmosphere for two minutes
without being seized with symptoms of poisoning.<a id='r2050' /><a href='#f2050' class='c013'><sup>[2050]</sup></a> Even a much
less proportion has the same effect. Five per cent. in the air will
affect small birds in two minutes, and kill them in half an hour.<a id='r2051' /><a href='#f2051' class='c013'><sup>[2051]</sup></a>
Persons have become apoplectic in an atmosphere of carbonic acid
gas, which to those who entered it appeared at first quite respirable.<a id='r2052' /><a href='#f2052' class='c013'><sup>[2052]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Secondly, Professor Rolando of Turin having found that the land
tortoise sustained little injury when the great air-tube of one lung
was tied,—he contrived to make it breathe carbonic acid gas with
one lung, while atmospheric air was inhaled by the other; and he
remarked that death took place in a few hours.<a id='r2053' /><a href='#f2053' class='c013'><sup>[2053]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_625'>625</span>Thirdly, the symptoms caused by inhaling the gas may be also
produced by applying it to the inner membrane of the stomach or to
the skin. On the one hand aërated water has been known to cause
giddiness or even intoxication when drunk too freely at first;<a id='r2054' /><a href='#f2054' class='c013'><sup>[2054]</sup></a> and
the sparkling wines probably owe their rapid intoxicating power to
the carbonic acid they contain. And, on the other hand, M. Collard
de Martigny has found that, if the human body be enclosed in an atmosphere
of the gas, due precautions being taken to preserve the
free access of common air to the lungs, the usual symptoms of poisoning
with carbonic acid are produced, such as weight in the head,
obscurity of sight, pain in the temples, ringing in the ears, giddiness,
and an undefinable feeling of terror; and that if the same experiment
be made on animals and continued long enough, death will be the
consequence.<a id='r2055' /><a href='#f2055' class='c013'><sup>[2055]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>When a man attempts to inhale pure carbonic acid gas, for example
by putting the face over the edge of a beer-vat, or the nose
into a jar containing chalk and weak muriatic acid, the nostrils and
throat are irritated so strongly, that the glottis closes and inspiration
becomes impossible. Sir H. Davy in making this experiment, farther
remarked, that the gas causes an acid taste in the mouth and
throat, and a sense of burning in the uvula.<a id='r2056' /><a href='#f2056' class='c013'><sup>[2056]</sup></a> I have remarked the
same effects from very pure gas disengaged by tartaric acid from
carbonate of soda. Hence, when a person is immersed in the gas
nearly or perfectly pure, as in a beer-vat, or old well, he dies at once
of suffocation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The effects are very different when the gas is considerably diluted;
for the symptoms then resemble apoplexy. As they differ somewhat
according to the source from which the gas is derived, and the admixtures
consequently breathed along with it, it will be necessary to
notice separately the effects of the pure gas diluted with air,—of the
emanations from burning charcoal, tallow, and coal,—and finally of
air vitiated by the breath.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. M. Chomel of Paris has related a case of poisoning with the
gas diluted with air, in the person of a labourer, who was suddenly
immersed in it at the bottom of a well, and remained there three-quarters
of an hour. He was first affected with violent and irregular
convulsions of the whole body and perfect insensibility, afterwards
with fits of spasm like tetanus; and during the second day, when
these symptoms had gone off, he continued to be affected with dumbness.<a id='r2057' /><a href='#f2057' class='c013'><sup>[2057]</sup></a>—It
is worthy of particular remark that, contrary to general
belief, these effects may be produced in situations where the air is
not sufficiently impure to extinguish lights. Thus M. Collard de
Martigny relates the case of a servant, who, on entering a cellar
where grape-juice was fermenting, became suddenly giddy, and,
under a vague impression of terror, fled from the place, dropping her
candle on the floor and shutting the door behind her. She fell down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_626'>626</span>insensible outside the door, and those who went to her assistance
found on opening the door that the light continued to burn.<a id='r2058' /><a href='#f2058' class='c013'><sup>[2058]</sup></a>—Mr.
Taylor indeed has since ascertained that a candle will burn in air,
which contains ten, or even twelve per cent. of carbonic acid,<a id='r2059' /><a href='#f2059' class='c013'><sup>[2059]</sup></a>—a
proportion more than sufficient to cause poisoning in no long time.
It is also important to observe, that, contrary to what would be expected
from the statements of Sir H. Davy and other experimentalists
on the effects of the pure gas, it will often happen that no odour
or taste is perceived. M. Bonami, in an account of an accident which
happened at Nantes to two workmen who descended an old well,
says that the first while descending uttered a piercing cry and fell
down; and that as soon as his comrade, who tried to rescue him,
was lowered ten or twelve feet, he felt as if he was about to be suffocated
for want of breath, but perceived no strong or disagreeable
smell.<a id='r2060' /><a href='#f2060' class='c013'><sup>[2060]</sup></a> It should be remembered therefore by workmen, that there
may be danger in descending pits where none is indicated by the
sense of smell, or by the extinguishing of a light.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The fumes of burning charcoal have been long known to be
deleterious. The early symptoms caused by them have been little
noticed; for, as this variety of poisoning generally occurs during sleep,
the patient is seldom seen till the symptoms are fully formed. In an
attempt at self-destruction described in a French journal, the first
effects were slight oppression, then violent palpitation, next confusion
of ideas, and at last insensibility.<a id='r2061' /><a href='#f2061' class='c013'><sup>[2061]</sup></a> Tightness in the temples, and
an undefinable sense of alarm have also been remarked;<a id='r2062' /><a href='#f2062' class='c013'><sup>[2062]</sup></a> and others
have, on the contrary, experienced a pleasing sensation that seduced
them to remain on the fatal spot.<a id='r2063' /><a href='#f2063' class='c013'><sup>[2063]</sup></a> The best account of the incipient
symptoms has been given by Mr. Coathupe of Wraxhall, in an
account of an experiment he made with Joyce’s stove,—a preposterous
invention, the fuel of which was supposed by the inventor to
burn without contaminating the air, although it was neither more
nor less than prepared charcoal. Having closed every aperture in a
room of the capacity of eighty cubic yards, Mr. Coathupe kindled
the stove and watched the results. In four hours he had slight giddiness,
in five hours and a half intense giddiness, the desire to vomit
without the power, excessive prostration and incapability of muscular
effort, a frequent full throbbing pulse, a sense of distention of the
cerebral arteries, agonizing headache, chiefly in the hindhead, but
no sense of suffocation. At this time he experienced great difficulty
in opening the window and removing the stove; and in seven hours,
when his wife entered the room, he was unable to tell what was the
matter, although quite conscious of all that was passing. He then
slowly recovered.<a id='r2064' /><a href='#f2064' class='c013'><sup>[2064]</sup></a> A similar account has also been given by Mr.
Chapman of Tooting of the effects of this notorious stove. A young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_627'>627</span>gentleman, after being only one hour in a chamber heated by it, felt
first slight giddiness and headache, and afterwards violent pain in the
head and tightness round the forehead and temples; the pupils became
excessively dilated and nearly insensible; there was constant
ringing in the ears, a feeble frequent pulse, paleness of the features
and lividity of the lips and hands, coldness of the extremities, laborious
irregular breathing, and extreme prostration. A temporary relief,
obtained by stimulants, was succeeded by violence; which, however,
was subdued by blood-letting; and he recovered.<a id='r2065' /><a href='#f2065' class='c013'><sup>[2065]</sup></a> A set of
cases, 70 in number, similar to the last two, but milder, occurred in
January, 1836, in the church of Downham in Norfolk, which was
heated by two of these stoves.<a id='r2066' /><a href='#f2066' class='c013'><sup>[2066]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The following abstract of a case by Dr. Babington will convey an
accurate idea of the advanced symptoms. The waiter of a tavern
and a little boy, on going to bed, left a choffer of charcoal burning
beside it; and next morning were found insensible. The boy died
immediately after they were discovered. The waiter had stertorous
breathing, livid lips, flushing of the face, and a full, strong pulse; for
which affections he was bled to ten ounces. When Dr. Babington
first saw him, however, the pulse had become feeble, the breathing
imperfect, and the limbs cold; the muscles were powerless but twitched
with slight convulsions, the sensibility gone, the face pale, the
eyelids closed, the eyes prominent and rolling, the tongue swollen
and the jaw locked upon it, and there was a great flow of saliva from
the mouth. The employment of galvanism at this time caused an evident
amendment in every symptom. But it was soon abandoned;
because each time it was applied, the excitement was rapidly followed
by corresponding depression. Cold water was then dashed upon him,
ammonia rubbed on his chest, and oxygen thrown into the lungs;
through which means a warm perspiration was brought out, and his
state rapidly improved. He was nearly lost, however, during the subsequent
night by hemorrhage from the divided vein; but next day he
was so well that he could even speak a little. For two days afterwards
the left side of the face was paralyzed, and his mental faculties
were somewhat disordered.<a id='r2067' /><a href='#f2067' class='c013'><sup>[2067]</sup></a>—In such cases as this the stupor is
generally very deep. There is a case in a French Journal of a girl,
who, after remaining some time in a small close chamber heated by a
charcoal choffer, fell down insensible, remained in that state for three
hours, and found, on recovering from her lethargy, that the choffer
had fallen, and burnt the skin and subjacent fat of the thighs to a
cinder.<a id='r2068' /><a href='#f2068' class='c013'><sup>[2068]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Occasionally the stage of stupor is followed, as in some other varieties
of narcotic poisoning, by a stage of delirium, at times of the furious
kind, or by a state resembling somnambulism.<a id='r2069' /><a href='#f2069' class='c013'><sup>[2069]</sup></a> It does not
follow that recovery is certain because coma has thus given place to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_628'>628</span>delirium,—an alteration, which in most varieties of narcotic poisoning
is considered a sure sign of recovery. Collard de Martigny has
related a case which eventually proved fatal, notwithstanding this sign
of improvement.<a id='r2070' /><a href='#f2070' class='c013'><sup>[2070]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The narcotism induced by breathing charcoal fumes often lasts a
considerable length of time,—much longer indeed than the effects of
other narcotic poisons. This will appear sufficiently from the case
described by Dr. Babington. One of the people, mentioned at the
commencement of this chapter as having been suffocated at Gerolzhofen,
lingered five days in a state of coma before he expired.</p>

<p class='c006'>Commonly in cases of recovery, there is found to have been no consciousness
of any thing going on around, or recollection of what passed
subsequently to the first impressions of poisoning. The reverse, however,
occurred in Mr. Coathupe’s experiment; and a similar instance has
been published, where the individual, though apparently insensible,
knew when the room was first entered by strangers, and heard them
call him by name and bid him put out his tongue, and stretch forth
his arm,—without, however, his having the power to answer, or in
any way to express the consciousness of understanding them.<a id='r2071' /><a href='#f2071' class='c013'><sup>[2071]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Poisoning with charcoal vapour has become a subject of great
importance in French medical jurisprudence, partly on account of the
frequency with which it is resorted to for the purpose of committing
suicide, and partly because repeated attempts have been made to conceal
murder by arranging matters so as to present the appearances of
suicide. M. Devergie says, that in the years 1834 and 1835 no fewer
than 360 cases of poisoning with charcoal-vapour occurred in Paris,
of which nearly four-fifths proved fatal; and he has given the particulars
of two attempts to conceal murder under the appearance of death
from this cause.<a id='r2072' /><a href='#f2072' class='c013'><sup>[2072]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The subject has therefore been carefully examined by various authors,
but by none so successfully as by M. Devergie; of whose important
researches the following is a brief analysis.</p>

<p class='c006'>In stating the various sources whence charcoal-vapour may become
incidentally the cause of death, he dwells particularly on the risk of
its admission from adjoining vents, even in other houses from that
where the accidents happen,—because there may be currents in the
apartment which occasion back-draught. Three remarkable cases of
this kind, very obscure in their origin, have been related by M.
d’Arcet.<a id='r2073' /><a href='#f2073' class='c013'><sup>[2073]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The very discrepant effects of the poison on different individuals,
simultaneously and to appearance alike exposed to it, have usually
been explained by reference to the great density of the gas, which
consequently accumulates near the floor. Some, however, have doubted
the fact that the gas is unequally diffused. Mr. Taylor in particular
says he ascertained by analysis, that air collected above and below
a choffer of burning charcoal was equally contaminated, that what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_629'>629</span>was collected a foot above its level contained 4·65 per cent., and that
another portion taken the same distance below it contained 4·5 of carbonic
acid.<a id='r2074' /><a href='#f2074' class='c013'><sup>[2074]</sup></a> M. Devergie has discovered the source of these discrepant
opinions. He has found,<a id='r2075' /><a href='#f2075' class='c013'><sup>[2075]</sup></a> that, notwithstanding the high density
of carbonic acid gas, the currents caused by the heat, disengaged when
charcoal is burnt in a room, without an issue for the products of combustion,
produce an equable mixture of gases at all elevations in the
apartment, provided the air be examined while still warm, and not
long after the charcoal has burnt out; but that, at a later period, such
as twelve hours, the carbonic acid partly separates and sinks, so that,
while the air at the top contains only a 78th, that near the floor contains
four times as much, or a 19th of carbonic acid gas.</p>

<p class='c006'>Disputes have also arisen as to the precise nature of the emanations
from burning charcoal,—some believing that carbonic acid is alone
discharged in such quantity as to prove injurious, and is singly sufficient
to account for the effects which have been observed,—while
others maintain that carbonic oxide, carburetted-hydrogen, or some
peculiar pyrogenous vapour, may be also formed, and prove the real
cause of the active properties of the vapour. According to the researches
of Orfila, charcoal in a state of vivid ignition emits carbonic
acid only, a hundred parts of the consumed air having been ascertained
by him to be composed of 42 azote, 46 common air, and 12
carbonic acid. But when the combustion is low, a hundred parts
consist of 52 azote, 20 common air, 14 carbonic acid, and 14 carburetted-hydrogen;
so that not only is the air more thoroughly consumed;
but likewise an additional poisonous gas is brought into action.<a id='r2076' /><a href='#f2076' class='c013'><sup>[2076]</sup></a> The
difference thus indicated has been supposed to account for what is
often observed in countries where charcoal choffers are much in use
for warming close apartments,—namely, that the practice is attended
with most danger when the combustion is low, and that it is unsafe
to close the doors of an apartment till the fuel is in a state of vivid
ignition. M. Guérard again maintains, that when the supply of air is
incomplete and combustion low, carbonic oxide gas is formed in considerable
quantity; and that this gas, confessedly a much more powerful
narcotic than carbonic acid, is probably the cause of many cases
of poisoning with charcoal fumes.<a id='r2077' /><a href='#f2077' class='c013'><sup>[2077]</sup></a> M. Devergie doubts the exactness
of Orfila’s experiments on this head, but gives no new analysis.
He observes that charcoal-vapour gives the air of a room a peculiar
odour and bluish misty appearance, the latter of which slowly diminishes,
and in twelve hours disappears; and that possibly there may be
both a little carbonic oxide and carburetted-hydrogen in the air. But
nevertheless he is of opinion that the carbonic acid alone is adequate
to occasion all the effects observed in man or animals.<a id='r2078' /><a href='#f2078' class='c013'><sup>[2078]</sup></a> Professor
Hünefeld is of a different opinion, and has supplied the most satisfactory
explanation of the important fact, that charcoal fumes are most
noxious when the fuel has been just kindled and burns low; for he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_630'>630</span>ascertained that at first it gives out a pyrogenous acid, which occasions
headache and tendency to sickness, and which is not a product
of combustion at the moment, but exists ready formed; and that when
charcoal is at a full red heat, this noxious substance is no longer
given off.<a id='r2079' /><a href='#f2079' class='c013'><sup>[2079]</sup></a> Mr. Coathupe also thinks the cause of poisoning by charcoal
fumes is an unknown pyrogenous body, and not carbonic acid
gas.<a id='r2080' /><a href='#f2080' class='c013'><sup>[2080]</sup></a>—This department of inquiry is obviously susceptible of more
precise information. But meanwhile, whatever may be the probability
that, besides carbonic acid, some other gases, or some peculiar
pyrogenous body, may occasionally exist in charcoal fumes, and increase
their poisonous property, little doubt can exist that the carbonic
acid is singly sufficient to account for all the leading phenomena.</p>

<p class='c006'>M. Devergie has been led to the opinion that air, in which a fourth
part of its oxygen has been converted into carbonic acid, and which
therefore contains five per cent. of that gas, is amply enough impregnated
to occasion death.<a id='r2081' /><a href='#f2081' class='c013'><sup>[2081]</sup></a> This corresponds with the observations
of M. Ollivier, who found that three per cent. was as much as could
be breathed with impunity even for a moderate length of time.<a id='r2082' /><a href='#f2082' class='c013'><sup>[2082]</sup></a>
Less, however, will suffice to prove injurious or even fatal, if the air
be breathed long. Mr. Coathupe inferred from a rough estimate,
that in the dangerous experiment he made upon himself, the carbonic
acid, if uniformly diffused in the apartment, which was probably the
case, amounted to only two per cent.; but his data were inadequate.<a id='r2083' /><a href='#f2083' class='c013'><sup>[2083]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Proceeding from the fact that five per cent. of carbonic acid is
sufficient to cause death, Devergie points out what quantity of charcoal
is required to form that proportion,—a question of no small
moment in respect to charges of murder, concealed under the semblance
of suicide by suffocation with charcoal fumes. And he shows,
that a French bushel, or decalitre, weighing 3000 grammes, is sufficient
for a close apartment of 1275 cubic mètres, that is 6·6 pounds
avoirdupois for a space of 1666 English cubic yards, provided the
gas be uniformly diffused.<a id='r2084' /><a href='#f2084' class='c013'><sup>[2084]</sup></a> The quantity of charcoal burnt in a
given case may be arrived at pretty nearly from the weight of ashes
left, which is estimated in round numbers at a twenty-fifth by himself,<a id='r2085' /><a href='#f2085' class='c013'><sup>[2085]</sup></a>
and at a twentieth by Ollivier.<a id='r2086' /><a href='#f2086' class='c013'><sup>[2086]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It is important to remark that complete closure of an apartment is
by no means essential for the action of carbonic acid, whether disengaged
within it or introduced from without. For poisoning has occurred,
even where a window was partially open.<a id='r2087' /><a href='#f2087' class='c013'><sup>[2087]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>3. It is probable that in some circumstances a very small quantity
of the mixed gases proceeding from the slow combustion of tallow
and other oily substances will produce dangerous symptoms. Dr.
Blackadder remarked in the course of his experiments on flame, that
the vapour into which oil is resolved, previous to its forming flame
<span class='pageno' id='Page_631'>631</span>round the wick, excites in minute quantities intense headache.<a id='r2088' /><a href='#f2088' class='c013'><sup>[2088]</sup></a>
The emanations from the burning snuff of a candle, which are probably
of the same nature, seem to be very poisonous. An instance
indeed has been recorded in which they proved fatal. A party of
iron-smiths, who were carousing on a festival day at Leipzig, amused
themselves with plaguing a boy, who was asleep in a corner of the
room, by holding under his nose the smoke of a candle just extinguished.
At first he was roused a little each time. But when the
amusement had been continued for half an hour he began to breathe
laboriously, was then attacked with incessant epileptic convulsions,
and died on the third day.<a id='r2089' /><a href='#f2089' class='c013'><sup>[2089]</sup></a>—The effects of such emanations are
probably owing to empyreumatic volatile oil, which will be presently
seen to be an active poison.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. The vapours from burning coal are the most noxious of all
kinds of emanations from fuel, and cause peculiar symptoms. But
they are less apt to lead to accidents than the vapour of charcoal,
as they are much more irritating to the lungs. This effect depends on
the sulphurous acid gas which is mingled with the carbonic acid.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sulphurous acid gas is exceedingly deleterious to vegetable life,
being hardly inferior in that respect to hydrochloric acid. Dr. Turner
and I found that a fifth of a cubic inch diluted with ten thousand
times its volume of air destroyed all the leaves of various plants in
forty-eight hours.<a id='r2090' /><a href='#f2090' class='c013'><sup>[2090]</sup></a> I am not acquainted with any experiments on
animals or observations on man regarding the effects of the pure gas.
But it will without a doubt prove a powerful irritant.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some of the peculiarities in the cases now to be mentioned were
possibly owing to the admixture of sulphuric acid gas with the carbonic,
both being inhaled in a diluted state. The cases are described
by Mr. Braid, at the time surgeon at Leadhills. In March, 1817,
several of the miners there were violently affected, and some killed,
in consequence, it was supposed, of the smoke of one of the steam-engines
having escaped into the way-gates, and contaminated the air
in the workings. Four men who attempted to force their way
through this air into the workings below were unable to advance
beyond, and seem to have died immediately. The rest attempted to
descend two hours after, but were suddenly stopped by the contaminated
air. As soon as they reached it, although their lights
burnt tolerably well, they felt difficulty in breathing, and were then
seized with violent pain and beating in the head, giddiness and
ringing in the ears, followed by vomiting, palpitation and anxiety,
weakness of the limbs and pains above the knees, and finally with
loss of recollection. Some of them made their escape, but others
remained till the air was so far purified that their companions could
descend to their aid. When Mr. Braid first saw them, some were
running about frantic and furious, striking all who came in their way,—some
ran off terrified whenever any one approached them,—some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_632'>632</span>were singing,—some praying,—others lying listless and insensible.
Many of them retched and vomited. In some the pulse
was quick, in others slow, in many irregular, and in all feeble. All
who could describe their complaints had violent headache, some of
them tenesmus, and a few diarrhœa. In a few days all recovered
except the first four and three others who had descended to the
deeper parts of the mine.<a id='r2091' /><a href='#f2091' class='c013'><sup>[2091]</sup></a>—Another accident of the same nature,
and followed by the same phenomena, happened more lately at
Leadhills.<a id='r2092' /><a href='#f2092' class='c013'><sup>[2092]</sup></a> Similar accidents have been also witnessed by Mr.
Bald, civil engineer, among the coal-miners who work in the neighbourhood
of a burning mine belonging to the Devon Company. It
is worthy of remark, that the men sometimes worked for a considerable
length of time before they were taken ill. Such being the case,
it will be readily conceived that the burning of the lights was not a
test of the wholesomeness of the air. Here, as at Leadhills and in
other instances already mentioned, the lights continued to burn where
the men were poisoned.<a id='r2093' /><a href='#f2093' class='c013'><sup>[2093]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>5. Somewhat analogous to the symptoms now described are the
effects of the gradual contamination of air in a confined apartment.
Every one must have read of the horrible death of the Englishmen
who were locked up all night in a close dungeon in Fort William at
Calcutta. One hundred and forty-six individuals were imprisoned
in a room twenty feet square, with only one small window; and
before next morning all but 23 died under the most dreadful of tortures,—that
of slowly increasing suffocation. They seem to have
been affected nearly in the same way as the workmen at Leadhills.<a id='r2094' /><a href='#f2094' class='c013'><sup>[2094]</sup></a>
A similar accident happened in London in 1742. The keeper of
the round-house of St. Martin’s, crammed 28 people into an apartment
six feet square and not quite six feet high; and four were suffocated.<a id='r2095' /><a href='#f2095' class='c013'><sup>[2095]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The morbid appearances left on the body after poisoning with
carbonic acid gas have been chiefly observed in persons killed by
charcoal vapour. According to Portal the vessels of the brain are
congested, and the ventricles contain serum; the lungs are distended,
as if emphysematous; the heart and great veins are gorged with
black fluid blood; the eyes are generally glistening and prominent,
the face red, and the tongue protruded and black.<a id='r2096' /><a href='#f2096' class='c013'><sup>[2096]</sup></a>—Gorging of the
cerebral vessels seems to be very common. Yet sometimes it is inconsiderable,
as in two cases related by Dr. Bright, where, except
in the sinuses and in the greater veins of the ventricles and substance
of the brain, no particular gorging or vascularity seems to have been
met with,—the external membranes in particular having been very
little injected.<a id='r2097' /><a href='#f2097' class='c013'><sup>[2097]</sup></a> This, however, is certainly a rare occurrence. Serous
effusion in the ventricles and under the arachnoid membrane is
very general, yet not invariable.—Dr. Schenck, medical inspector
<span class='pageno' id='Page_633'>633</span>of Siegen, in reporting two cases of death caused by the vapours of
burning wood, notices paleness of the countenance as a singular accompaniment
of cerebral congestion; and calls the attention of medical
jurists to the extreme calmness of the features as a general
character of this variety of poisoning.<a id='r2098' /><a href='#f2098' class='c013'><sup>[2098]</sup></a> Although the same appearance
has also been noticed by others,<a id='r2099' /><a href='#f2099' class='c013'><sup>[2099]</sup></a> the countenance nevertheless
is often livid. But whether livid or pale, it is always composed.—It
appears from an account in Pyl’s Essays of several cases of suffocation
from the fumes of burning wood, that besides the appearances
mentioned by Portal, there is usually great livor of the back, frothiness
as well as fluidity of the blood, and more or less gorging of the
lungs with blood.<a id='r2100' /><a href='#f2100' class='c013'><sup>[2100]</sup></a>—A common appearance where the poisonous emanation
has been charcoal vapour, is a lining of dark, or sometimes
actually black dust on the mucous membranes of the air passages,
thickest near the external opening of the nostrils, and disappearing
towards the glottis. There are obvious reasons why this appearance
cannot always be expected to occur; but when present, it may be in
doubtful circumstances a very important article of evidence.<a id='r2101' /><a href='#f2101' class='c013'><sup>[2101]</sup></a> In
Wildberg’s collection of cases there is a report on two people who
were suffocated in bed, in consequence of the servant having neglected
to open the flue-trap when she kindled the stove in the bed-chamber;
and in each of them Wildberg found all the appearances now quoted
from Portal and Pyl. The tongue was black and swelled.<a id='r2102' /><a href='#f2102' class='c013'><sup>[2102]</sup></a>—Mertzdorff
has related a case of death from the same cause, in which,
together with the preceding appearances, an effusion of blood was
found between the arachnoid and pia mater over the whole surface
of both hemispheres.<a id='r2103' /><a href='#f2103' class='c013'><sup>[2103]</sup></a> In one of Dr. Bright’s cases there was a small
ecchymosis in the cortical substance on the outer side of the anterior
lobe, and not extending into the medullary matter. Fallot mentions
an instance of suffocation from charcoal vapour, where a little coagulated
blood was found between the layers of the arachnoid membrane
of the cerebellum in the region of the left occipital hollow.<a id='r2104' /><a href='#f2104' class='c013'><sup>[2104]</sup></a> Three
instances of extravasation are enumerated in a list of German cases
analysed by Dr. Bird.<a id='r2105' /><a href='#f2105' class='c013'><sup>[2105]</sup></a> Such appearances might be expected more
frequently, considering the manifest tendency of this kind of poisoning
to cause congestion in the head.—The blood is generally described
as being liquid and very dark. But M. Ollivier has lately
called attention to the fact, that the blood both before and after death
is not unusually more florid in the veins than natural.<a id='r2106' /><a href='#f2106' class='c013'><sup>[2106]</sup></a> In a case
mentioned by M. Rayer globules of an oily-looking matter were found
swimming on the surface of the blood and urine.<a id='r2107' /><a href='#f2107' class='c013'><sup>[2107]</sup></a> This is a solitary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_634'>634</span>observation.—The body usually remains flaccid, and the customary
stage of rigidity is imperfect. In some instances, however, as in
those related by Dr. Schenck, the stage of rigidity is passed through
in the usual manner. It is not uncommon to find vomited matter
lying beside the body, a circumstance which may naturally mislead
the unpractised. This is represented by Professor Wagner of Berlin
to have occurred uniformly in his experience;<a id='r2108' /><a href='#f2108' class='c013'><sup>[2108]</sup></a> and it is also mentioned
in many of the cases reported by others;<a id='r2109' /><a href='#f2109' class='c013'><sup>[2109]</sup></a> but it is not invariable.—A
red appearance in the stomach and intestines has been
noticed in many cases,<a id='r2110' /><a href='#f2110' class='c013'><sup>[2110]</sup></a> and often ascribed to inflammation; but it is
probably nothing more than the result of the venous congestion, which
pervades most of the membranous surfaces of the body.</p>

<p class='c006'>The least variable appearances according to Dr. Bird are general
lividity, protrusion of the tongue, a calm expression and attitude,
cerebral congestion, and serous effusion. This author’s paper in the
Medical Gazette, 1838–39, i., or in Guy’s Hospital Reports, iv., enters
very fully into the appearances after death, and may be consulted
with advantage for further details.</p>

<p class='c006'>The treatment of poisoning with carbonic acid consists chiefly in
the occasional employment of the cold affusion, and in moderate
blood-letting either from the arm or from the head. In a case which
happened at Paris, where a lady tried to make away with herself by
breathing charcoal fumes, and was found in a state of almost hopeless
insensibility, various remedies were tried unsuccessfully, till
cupping from the nape of the neck was resorted to; and she then
rapidly recovered.<a id='r2111' /><a href='#f2111' class='c013'><sup>[2111]</sup></a> Another instance where blood-letting was also
singularly successful deserves particular mention; because for three
hours the patient remained without pulsation in any artery, and
without the slightest perceptible respiration. At first neither by cupping
nor by venesection could any blood be obtained; and it was
only after the long interval just mentioned, and constant artificial inflation
of the lungs, that the blood at length trickled slowly from the
arm. The pulse and breathing were after this soon re-established;
but it was not till eight hours later that sensibility returned.<a id='r2112' /><a href='#f2112' class='c013'><sup>[2112]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of Poisoning with Carbonic Oxide Gas.</i>—Carbonic oxide gas,
according to Nysten, has not any effect on man when injected into
the pleura; but when thrown slowly into the veins, it gives the arterial
blood a brownish tint, and induces for a short time a state resembling
intoxication.<a id='r2113' /><a href='#f2113' class='c013'><sup>[2113]</sup></a> The quantity injected into the veins was
probably too small to produce the full effect, or it was discharged in
passing through the lungs; for this gas certainly appears to be very
deleterious when breathed by man, or the lower animals. M. Leblanc
found by experiment that a sparrow was killed almost immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_635'>635</span>in air containing only a twentieth of it, and that so little even
as a hundredth part proved fatal in two minutes.<a id='r2114' /><a href='#f2114' class='c013'><sup>[2114]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>A set of interesting but hazardous experiments were made with it
in 1814 by the assistants of Mr. Higgins of Dublin. One gentleman,
after inhaling it two or three times, was seized with giddiness, tremors,
and an approach to insensibility, succeeded by languor, weakness,
and headache of some hours’ duration. The other had almost
paid dearly for his curiosity. Having previously exhausted his lungs,
he inhaled the pure gas three or four times, upon which he was suddenly
deprived of sense and motion, fell down supine, and continued
for half an hour insensible, apparently lifeless, and with the pulse
nearly extinct. Various means were tried for rousing him, without
success; till at last oxygen gas was blown into the lungs. Animation
then returned rapidly: but he was affected for the rest of the
day with convulsive agitation of the body, stupor, violent headache,
and quick irregular pulse; and after his senses were quite restored,
he suffered from giddiness, blindness, nausea, alternate heats and
chills, and then feverish, broken, but irresistible sleep.<a id='r2115' /><a href='#f2115' class='c013'><sup>[2115]</sup></a> A French
aëronaut, who used for his balloon a mixture of carbonic oxide and
hydrogen, obtained by decomposing water with red-hot charcoal,
lately suffered from similar symptoms in a milder degree, in consequence
of the gas being disengaged upon him from the safety-valve
of his balloon.<a id='r2116' /><a href='#f2116' class='c013'><sup>[2116]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of Poisoning with Nitrous Oxide Gas.</i>—The nitrous oxide or intoxicating
gas is the last of the narcotic gases to be noticed. Nysten
found, that, when slowly injected in large quantity into the veins of
animals, it only caused slight staggering.<a id='r2117' /><a href='#f2117' class='c013'><sup>[2117]</sup></a> Frequent observation,
however, has shown that it is by no means so inert when breathed
by man. Sir H. Davy, who first had the courage to inhale it, observed
that it excited giddiness, a delightful sense of thrilling in the
chest and limbs, acuteness of hearing, brilliancy of all surrounding
objects, and an unconquerable propensity to brisk muscular exertion.
These feelings were of short duration, but were generally succeeded
by alertness of body and mind, never by the exhaustion, depression,
and nausea, which follow the stage of excitement brought on by
spirits or opium.<a id='r2118' /><a href='#f2118' class='c013'><sup>[2118]</sup></a> Although many have since experienced the same
enticing effects, yet they are by no means uniform. For others have
been suddenly seized with great weakness, tendency to faint, loss of
voice, and sometimes convulsions; and two of Thenard’s assistants,
on making the experiment, fainted away, and remained some seconds
motionless and insensible.<a id='r2119' /><a href='#f2119' class='c013'><sup>[2119]</sup></a> It is a remarkable circumstance in the
operation of this gas, that, unlike other stimulants, it does not lose
its virtues under the influence of habit. Neither does the habitual
use of it lead to any ill consequence. Sir H. Davy, in the course of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_636'>636</span>his researches, which were continued above two months, breathed it
occasionally three or four times a day for a week together, at other
periods four or five times a week only; yet at the end his health
was good, his mind clear, his digestion perfect, and his strength only
a little impaired.<a id='r2120' /><a href='#f2120' class='c013'><sup>[2120]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Nitrous oxide gas is one of the few gases that are not injurious to
vegetables. Dr. Turner and I found that seventy-two cubic inches,
diluted with six times their volume of air, had no effect on a mignionette
plant in forty-eight hours.<a id='r2121' /><a href='#f2121' class='c013'><sup>[2121]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of Poisoning with Cyanogen Gas.</i>—<i>Cyanogen gas</i> has been proved
by the experiments of M. Coullon to be an active poison to all animals,—the
guinea-pig, sparrow, leech, frog, wood-louse, fly, crab;
and the symptoms induced were coma, and more rarely convulsions.<a id='r2122' /><a href='#f2122' class='c013'><sup>[2122]</sup></a>
These results are confirmed by the later experiments of Hünefeld,
who found that it produces in the rabbit anxious breathing, slight
convulsions, staring of the eyes, dilated pupils, coma, and death in
five or six minutes.<a id='r2123' /><a href='#f2123' class='c013'><sup>[2123]</sup></a> Buchner likewise found that small birds, held
for a few seconds over the mouth of a jar containing cyanogen, died
very speedily; and on one occasion remarked, while preparing the
gas, that the fore-finger, which was exposed to the bubbles as they
escaped, became suddenly benumbed, and that this effect was attended
with a singular feeling of pressure and contraction in the
joints of the thumb and elbow.<a id='r2124' /><a href='#f2124' class='c013'><sup>[2124]</sup></a> It would undoubtedly be most dangerous
to breathe this gas, except much diluted, and in very small
quantity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of all narcotic gases it is the most noxious to vegetables. Dr.
Turner and I found that a third of a cubic inch, diluted with 1700
times its volume of air, caused the leaves of a mignionette plant to
droop in twenty-four hours. As usual with the effects of narcotic
gases on vegetables, the drooping went on after the plant was removed
into the open air; and in a short time it was completely
killed.<a id='r2125' /><a href='#f2125' class='c013'><sup>[2125]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of Poisoning with Oxygen Gas.</i>—Of all the narcotic gases, none
is more singular in its effects than oxygen. When breathed in a state
of purity by animals, they live much longer than in the same volume
of atmospheric air. But if the experiment be kept up for a sufficient
length of time, symptoms of narcotic poisoning begin to manifest
themselves. For an hour no inconvenience seems to be felt; but
the breathing and pulse then become accelerated; a state of debility
next ensues; at length insensibility gradually comes on, with glazing
of the eyes, slow respiration and gasping; coma is in the end completely
formed; and death ensues in the course of six, ten, or twelve
hours. If the animals are removed into the air before the insensibility
is considerable, they quickly recover. When the body is examined
immediately after death, the heart is seen beating strongly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_637'>637</span>but the diaphragm motionless; the whole blood in the veins as well
as the arteries is of a bright scarlet colour; some of the membranous
surfaces, such as the pulmonary pleura, have the same tint, and the
blood coagulates with remarkable rapidity. The gas in which an
animal has died rekindles a blown out taper. These experiments,
which physiology owes to the researches of Mr. Broughton,<a id='r2126' /><a href='#f2126' class='c013'><sup>[2126]</sup></a> furnish
a solitary example of death from stoppage of the respiration, although
the heart continues to pulsate, and the lungs to transmit florid blood.
Death is probably owing to hyper-arterialization of the blood.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXII.<br /> <span class='small'>CLASS THIRD.<br /> OF NARCOTICO-ACRID POISONS GENERALLY.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>The third class of poisons, the narcotico-acrids, includes those
which possess a double action, the one local and irritating like that
of the irritants, the other remote, and consisting of an impression on
the nervous system.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sometimes they cause narcotism; which is generally of a comatose
nature, often attended with delirium; but in one very singular group
there is neither insensibility nor delirium, but merely violent tetanic
spasms.</p>

<p class='c006'>At other times they excite inflammation where they are applied.
This effect, however, is by no means constant. For Orfila justly
observes, that under the name of narcotico-acrids several poisons
are usually described which seldom excite inflammation. Those
which inflame the tissues where they are applied rarely occasion
death in this manner. Some of them may produce very violent
local symptoms; but they generally prove fatal through their operation
on the nervous system.</p>

<p class='c006'>For the most part, their narcotic and irritant effects appear incompatible.
That is, when they act narcotically, the body is insensible
to the local irritation; and when they irritate, the dose is not large
enough to act narcotically. In large doses, therefore, they act chiefly
as narcotics, in small doses as irritants. Sometimes, however, the
narcotic symptoms are preceded or followed by symptoms of irritation;
and more rarely both exist simultaneously.</p>

<p class='c006'>Most, if not all, of them, to whatever part of the body they are
applied, act remotely by entering the blood-vessels; but it has not
been settled whether they operate by being carried with the blood
to the part on which they act, or by producing on the inner membrane
of the vessels a peculiar impression, which is conveyed along
the nerves. Some of them produce direct and obvious effects where
they are applied. Thus monkshood induces a peculiar numbness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_638'>638</span>and tingling of the part with which it is placed in contact. The
organs on which they act remotely are the brain and spine, and sometimes
the heart also.</p>

<p class='c006'>The appearances in the dead body are, for the most part, inconsiderable;
more or less inflammation in the stomach or intestines,
and congestion in the brain; but even these are not constant.</p>

<p class='c006'>As a distinct class, they differ little from some poisons of the previous
classes. Several of the metallic irritants, and a few vegetable
acrids are, properly speaking, narcotico-acrids: they excite either
narcotism or irritation, according to circumstances. But still, the
poisons about to be considered form a good natural order when contrasted
with these irritants. For the irritants which possess a double
action are nevertheless characterized by the symptoms of inflammation
being at least their most prominent effects; while the most
prominent feature in the effects of the poisons now to be considered
is injury of the nervous system. It is more difficult to draw the line
of separation between the present class and the pure narcotics; for
many narcotico-acrids rarely cause any symptom but those of narcotism.</p>

<p class='c006'>The narcotico-acrids are all derived from the vegetable kingdom.
Many of them owe their power to an alkaloid, consisting of oxygen,
hydrogen, carbon, and azote.</p>

<p class='c006'>The characters which distinguish the symptoms and morbid appearances
of the narcotico-acrids from those of natural disease, do
not require special mention; for almost all the remarks made in the
introduction to the class of narcotics are applicable to the present
class also. A few of the characters, however, which have been laid
down, do not apply so well to the narcotico-acrids as to the narcotics.
In particular, it appears that what was said on the short duration
of the effects of the narcotics does not apply so well to the present
class of poisons; some of which, in a single dose, continue to
cause symptoms even of narcotism for two or three days. But the
rule, that they seldom prove fatal if the case lasts above twelve
hours, is still applicable,—at all events they rarely prove fatal after
that interval by their narcotic action. The poisonous fungi, however,
have proved fatal as narcotics so late as thirty-six hours, or
even three days, after they were taken; and perhaps digitalis has
proved fatal narcotically at the remote period of three weeks. But
such cases are extremely rare.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some narcotico-acids, such as the different species of <i>strychnos</i>, are
quite peculiar in their effects; so that their symptoms may be distinguished
at once from natural disease.</p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila divides the narcotico-acrids into six groups, and this arrangement
will be followed in the present work; but they are not all
very well distinguished from one another.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING WITH NIGHTSHADE, THORN-APPLE, AND TOBACCO.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The first group of the narcotico-acrids comprehends these whose
principal symptom in the early stage of their effects is delirium. All
the plants of the group belong to the natural order <i>Solanaceæ</i>, and
Linnæus’s class Pentandria Monogynia. Those which have been particularly
examined are deadly nightshade, thorn-apple, and tobacco.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Deadly Nightshade.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The deadly nightshade, or <i>Atropa belladonna</i>, is allied in physiological
and botanical characters to the <i>hyoscyamus</i> and <i>solanum</i> formerly
mentioned; and by the older writers, indeed, was confounded
with the latter. It is a native of Britain, growing in shady places,
particularly on the edge of woods. The berries, which ripen in
September, have a jet-black colour. Their beauty has frequently
tempted both children and adults to eat them, although they have a
mawkish taste; and many have suffered severely. It is not the berry
alone which is poisonous; the whole plant is so; and the root is
probably the most active part.<a id='r2127' /><a href='#f2127' class='c013'><sup>[2127]</sup></a> From one to four grains of the
dried powder of the root will occasion dryness in the throat, giddiness,
staggering, flushed face, dilated pupils, and sometimes even delirium.<a id='r2128' /><a href='#f2128' class='c013'><sup>[2128]</sup></a>
The juice of the leaves is very energetic, two grains of its
extract being, when well prepared, a large enough dose to cause
disagreeable symptoms in man. It is a very uncertain preparation,
unless when procured by evaporation <i>in vacuo</i>; for some samples
from the Parisian shops have been found by Orfila to be quite inert.</p>

<p class='c006'>It contains a peculiar alkaloid, named <i>atropia</i>. In the belladonna
Brandes obtained a volatile, oily-like, alkaloidal fluid, of a penetrating
narcotic smell, and bitterish, acrid taste, which he supposed to
be the active principle of the plant.<a id='r2129' /><a href='#f2129' class='c013'><sup>[2129]</sup></a> The ulterior researches of
Geiger and Hesse, however, as well as the simultaneous analysis of
Mein, have proved that this fluid is not the pure alkaloid of belladonna,
and that the real atropia is a solid substance, forming colourless,
silky crystals, soluble in ether and alcohol, sparingly so in water,
slightly bitter, liable to decomposition under contact with air and
moisture, volatilizable, but with some decomposition, a little above
212°, and capable of forming definite crystallizable salts with acids.<a id='r2130' /><a href='#f2130' class='c013'><sup>[2130]</sup></a>
The aqueous solutions of its salts exhale during evaporation a narcotic
vapour, which dilates the pupil, and causes sickness, giddiness,
and headache.<a id='r2131' /><a href='#f2131' class='c013'><sup>[2131]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The ordinary extract of belladonna in the dose of half an ounce will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_640'>640</span>kill a dog in thirty hours when introduced into the stomach. Half
that quantity applied to a wound will kill it in twenty-four hours.
And forty grains injected into the jugular vein prove even more
quickly fatal. Convulsions are rarely produced, but only a state like
intoxication.<a id='r2132' /><a href='#f2132' class='c013'><sup>[2132]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The oleaginous atropia of Brandes in a dose of two or three drops
kill small birds instantaneously like concentrated hydrocyanic acid; in
less doses it occasions staggering, gasping, and in a few minutes death
amidst convulsions; and the dead body presents throughout the internal
organs great venous turgescence and even extravasation of blood, but
more especially excessive congestion within the head.<a id='r2133' /><a href='#f2133' class='c013'><sup>[2133]</sup></a> The pure
crystalline atropia of Mein, when dissolved in water and greatly diluted,
causes extreme and protracted dilatation of the pupils.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Symptoms in Man.</i>—On man the effects of belladonna are much
more remarkable. In small doses, whatever be the kind or surface
to which it is applied,—such as the skin round the eye, or the surface
of a wound, or the inner membrane of the stomach,—it causes
dilatation of the pupil. This effect may be excited without any constitutional
derangement. When the extract is rubbed on the skin
round the eye, or a solution of it dropped upon the eyeball, vision
is not impaired; but when it is taken internally so as to affect the
pupils, the sight is commonly much obscured. The effects of large
or poisonous doses have been frequently witnessed in consequence of
children and adults being tempted to eat the berries by their fine
colour and bright lustre. From the cases that have been published
the leading symptoms appear in the first instance to be dryness in
the throat, then delirium with dilated pupils, and afterwards coma.
Convulsions are rare, and, when present, slight.</p>

<p class='c006'>The dryness of the throat is not a constant symptom. It is often,
however, very distinct. It occurred, for example, in 150 soldiers
who were poisoned near Dresden, as related by M. Gaultier de Claubry,<a id='r2134' /><a href='#f2134' class='c013'><sup>[2134]</sup></a>
and in six soldiers whose cases have been described by Mr.
Brumwell.<a id='r2135' /><a href='#f2135' class='c013'><sup>[2135]</sup></a> The former had not only dryness of the throat, but
likewise difficulty in swallowing.</p>

<p class='c006'>The delirium is generally extravagant, and also most commonly
of the pleasing kind, sometimes accompanied with immoderate uncontrollable
laughter, sometimes with constant talking, but occasionally
with complete loss of voice, as in the cases of the 150 soldiers.
At other times the state of mind resembles somnambulism, as in the
instance of a tailor who was poisoned with a belladonna injection,
and who for fifteen hours, though speechless and insensible to external
objects, went through all the customary operations of his trade
with great vivacity, and moved his lips as if in conversation.<a id='r2136' /><a href='#f2136' class='c013'><sup>[2136]</sup></a> Sometimes
frantic delirium is almost the only symptom of consequence
throughout the whole duration of the poisoning. Thus a gentleman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_641'>641</span>at Perigueux in France, who took by mistake a mixture containing a
drachm and a half of extract, was attacked in half an hour with delirium,
which soon became furious, and continued till next day, when
it gradually left him.<a id='r2137' /><a href='#f2137' class='c013'><sup>[2137]</sup></a> In others the delirium is attended with a
singular and total loss of consciousness, but without coma, as in the
following case which occurred not long ago at St. Omer. A young
man having taken by mistake an infusion of two drachms of dried
leaves, was seized in an hour with great dryness of the mouth and
throat, afterwards slight delirium, loss of consciousness, and dilatation
of the pupil, next with retention of urine, convulsive twitches
of the face and extremities, and incessant tendency to walk up and
down. In three hours, after the action of an emetic and a clyster,
he lay down, but still in a state of total unconsciousness and muttering
delirium. Blood-letting being at last resorted to as a remedy,
he speedily recovered his senses, and eventually got well, after suffering
for some time from headache, fatigue, and much debility.<a id='r2138' /><a href='#f2138' class='c013'><sup>[2138]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The pupil is not only dilated in all cases, but likewise for the most
part insensible;<a id='r2139' /><a href='#f2139' class='c013'><sup>[2139]</sup></a> and, as in the soldiers at Dresden, the eyeball is
sometimes red and prominent. The vision also, as in these soldiers,
is generally obscure; sometimes it is lost for a time;<a id='r2140' /><a href='#f2140' class='c013'><sup>[2140]</sup></a> and so completely
that even the brightest light cannot be distinguished.<a id='r2141' /><a href='#f2141' class='c013'><sup>[2141]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The sopor or lethargy, which follows the delirium, occasionally
does not supervene for a considerable interval. In a case related by
Munnik it did not begin till twelve hours after the poison was taken.<a id='r2142' /><a href='#f2142' class='c013'><sup>[2142]</sup></a>
Sometimes, as in the same case, the delirium returns when the stupor
goes off. A patient of my colleague Dr. Simpson, after using a belladonna
suppository consisting of two grains of extract, was attacked
with dryness of the throat and delirium, followed soon by drowsiness
and stupor; and in five or six hours more, as the stupor wore off, the
delirium returned, prompting to constant movements as if she was
busy with her toilette and various other ordinary occupations. Sometimes
the relation of the delirium to the coma is reversed, as in a case
related by Mr. Clayton, where sopor came on first, and delirium
ensued in six hours. The dose in this instance was forty grains of
the extract.<a id='r2143' /><a href='#f2143' class='c013'><sup>[2143]</sup></a> Frequently the stupor is not distinct at any stage.—Even
the delirium is not always formed rapidly. A man whose case
is described by Sir John Hill did not become giddy for two hours
after eating the berries, and the delirium did not appear till five hours
later.<a id='r2144' /><a href='#f2144' class='c013'><sup>[2144]</sup></a> In Mr. Brumwell’s cases, the delirium was not particularly
noticed till the morning after the berries were taken.</p>

<p class='c006'>Convulsions, it has been already stated, are rare. In the case
from the 24th volume of Sedillot’s Journal, the muscles of the face
were somewhat convulsed: there is also at times more or less locked-jaw,<a id='r2145' /><a href='#f2145' class='c013'><sup>[2145]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_642'>642</span>or subsultus tendinum;<a id='r2146' /><a href='#f2146' class='c013'><sup>[2146]</sup></a> and occasionally much abrupt agitation
of the extremities.<a id='r2147' /><a href='#f2147' class='c013'><sup>[2147]</sup></a> But well-marked convulsions do not appear to
be ever present.</p>

<p class='c006'>The effects now detailed are by no means so quickly dissipated as
those of opium. Almost every person who has taken a considerable
dose has been ill for a day at least. The case from Sedillot’s Journal
lasted three days, delirium having continued twelve hours, the
succeeding stupor for nearly two days, and the departure of the stupor
being attended with a return of delirium for some hours longer. One
of Mr. Brumwell’s patients, too, was delirious for three days; and
Plenck has noticed several instances where the delirium was equally
tedious.<a id='r2148' /><a href='#f2148' class='c013'><sup>[2148]</sup></a> Sage has related a case in which the individual was
comatose for thirty hours.<a id='r2149' /><a href='#f2149' class='c013'><sup>[2149]</sup></a> Blindness is also a very obstinate symptom,
which sometimes remains after the affection of the mind has
disappeared. This happened in Plenck’s cases. In two children
whose cases have been described in a late French journal, the eyes
were insensible to the brightest light for three days.<a id='r2150' /><a href='#f2150' class='c013'><sup>[2150]</sup></a> In general,
the dilated state of the pupils continues long after the other symptoms
have departed. It further appears from an official narrative in Rust’s
Journal, that dilated pupil is not the only symptom which may thus
continue, but that various nervous affections, such as giddiness, disordered
vision, and tremors, may prevail even for three or four weeks.<a id='r2151' /><a href='#f2151' class='c013'><sup>[2151]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Hitherto little or no mention has been made of symptoms of irritation
from this poison. They are in fact uncommon, and seldom violent.
In the cases related by Gaultier de Claubry and by Mr. Brumwell,
dryness and soreness of the throat and difficult deglutition were
remarked, and appear not unusual. These symptoms were especially
noticed by Buchner, who by way of curiosity took half a drachm of
seeds digested in beer. The sense of dryness and constriction of the
throat were such as to prevent him swallowing even the saliva.<a id='r2152' /><a href='#f2152' class='c013'><sup>[2152]</sup></a>
Sage’s patient passed blood by stool; and after the symptoms of narcotic
poisoning ceased, he had aphthous inflammation in the throat,
and swallowing was so difficult as for some time to excite convulsive
struggles. Aphthæ in the throat and swelling of the belly also succeeded
the delirium in Munnik’s case. Mr. Wibmer alludes to the
case of a man who, besides difficult deglutition at the beginning, had
violent strangury towards the close.<a id='r2153' /><a href='#f2153' class='c013'><sup>[2153]</sup></a> An instance of violent strangury
with suppression of urine and bloody micturition is also related
by M. Jolly. In the early stage, the patient had redness of the throat
and burning along the whole alimentary canal, combined with the
customary delirium and loss of consciousness. The symptoms were
caused by forty-six grains of the extract given by mistake instead of
jalap.<a id='r2154' /><a href='#f2154' class='c013'><sup>[2154]</sup></a> Nausea and efforts to vomit are not infrequent at the commencement.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the accident be taken in time, poisoning with belladonna is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_643'>643</span>rarely fatal; for, as the state first induced is delirium, not sopor, suspicion
is soon excited, and emetics may be made to act before a sufficient
quantity of the poison has been absorbed to prove fatal. Hence
few fatal instances have occurred in recent times. Mr. Wilmer, however,
has mentioned two fatal cases occurring in children, and terminating
within twenty-four hours.<a id='r2155' /><a href='#f2155' class='c013'><sup>[2155]</sup></a> M. Boucher, a writer in the old
French Journal of Medicine, has referred to several cases of the same
nature;<a id='r2156' /><a href='#f2156' class='c013'><sup>[2156]</sup></a> Gmelin has described the particulars of a good example;<a id='r2157' /><a href='#f2157' class='c013'><sup>[2157]</sup></a>
and many others have been succinctly quoted by Wibmer, chiefly
from the older authors.<a id='r2158' /><a href='#f2158' class='c013'><sup>[2158]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Cases of poisoning with this plant have occurred in man through
other channels besides the stomach. Allusion has already been
made to the instance of a tailor who was poisoned by an injection.
A small quantity will sometimes suffice when administered in that
way. A woman, whose case is mentioned in Rust’s Journal, was attacked
with wild delirium, flushed face and glistening eyes, in consequence
of receiving, during labour, a clyster, that contained six
grains of the common extract;<a id='r2159' /><a href='#f2159' class='c013'><sup>[2159]</sup></a> and Dr. Simpson’s patient, who was
severely affected, had only two grains.</p>

<p class='c006'>Perhaps the berry is in some circumstances not very active. A
French physician, M. Gigault of Pontcroix, says he has frequently had
occasion to treat cases of poisoning with it, as accidents of the kind
are extremely common in his neighbourhood; that he never knew it
prove fatal; and that in one instance a young man took a pound of
the berries before going to bed, and was not subjected to treatment
till next morning, when he was found in a state of delirium, but
speedily recovered after the free operation of emetics.<a id='r2160' /><a href='#f2160' class='c013'><sup>[2160]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Morbid Appearances.</i>—I have hitherto seen but one good account
of the appearances after death from poisoning with belladonna. It is
described by Gmelin. The subject was a shepherd who died comatose
twelve hours after eating the berries. When the body was
examined twelve hours after death, putrefaction had begun, so that
the belly was swelled, the scrotum and penis distended with fetid
serum, the skin covered with dark vesicles, and the brain soft. The
blood-vessels of the head were gorged, and the blood every where
fluid, and flowing profusely from the mouth, nose, and eyes.<a id='r2161' /><a href='#f2161' class='c013'><sup>[2161]</sup></a> In
the only other fatal case I have read, where the body was inspected,
there appears to have been no unusual appearance at all.<a id='r2162' /><a href='#f2162' class='c013'><sup>[2162]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>As the husks and seeds of the berries are very indigestible, some
of them will almost certainly be found in the stomach, as happened
in the instance last quoted. It should likewise be remembered that
the best possible evidence of the cause of the symptoms may be derived
during life from the presence of the seeds, husks, or even entire
berries, in the discharges. If vomiting has not been brought on at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_644'>644</span>an early period, we may expect to find these remains both in the
vomited matter and in the alvine evacuations. Mr. Wilmer mentions
an instance in which the black husks appeared in the stools
brought away by laxatives at least thirty hours after the poison was
swallowed.<a id='r2163' /><a href='#f2163' class='c013'><sup>[2163]</sup></a> One of Mr. Brumwell’s patients vomited the seeds
towards the close of the third day.<a id='r2164' /><a href='#f2164' class='c013'><sup>[2164]</sup></a> Several patients of M. Boucher
vomited fragments of the fruit on the second day, and passed more
by stool and injections on the third, although they had been treated
with activity from the commencement.<a id='r2165' /><a href='#f2165' class='c013'><sup>[2165]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>While most of the cases of poisoning with belladonna have originated
in accident, at the same time they have not been all of this
description. Gmelin has quoted an instance of intentional and fatal
poisoning by the juice of the berries being mixed with wine; and
another singular case of poisoning with the decoction of the buds,
given by an old woman for the purpose of committing theft during
the stupor of the individual.<a id='r2166' /><a href='#f2166' class='c013'><sup>[2166]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Other species of atropa are probably similar to belladonna in properties.
Wibmer quotes a single instance of frantic delirium occurring
among several shepherds, as well as their cattle, from eating the
herb of the <i>A. mandragora</i>.<a id='r2167' /><a href='#f2167' class='c013'><sup>[2167]</sup></a> This is well known to have been used
anciently as a medicinal narcotic.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Thorn-Apple.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The thorn-apple, or <i>Datura stramonium</i>, is another plant of the
same natural order, which it is proper to notice, because people have
often been poisoned with it, and it has become a common ornament
of our gardens. The cases of poisoning which have occurred in recent
times in this country have been all accidental. But not long
ago the thorn-apple appears to have been extensively used in Germany
to cause loss of consciousness and lethargy, preparatory to the
commission of various crimes.<a id='r2168' /><a href='#f2168' class='c013'><sup>[2168]</sup></a> It was also proved to have been
used lately in France for this purpose. Some thieves made a man
insensible with wine in which stramonium seeds had been steeped,
and robbed him of five hundred francs while in this state. For
twenty-four hours the victim knew nothing of what became of him;
he was met wandering in a wood, affected with delirium, unconsciousness,
staring of the eyes, and oppression of the breathing; and
for some time he was taken for a madman.<a id='r2169' /><a href='#f2169' class='c013'><sup>[2169]</sup></a> In the Eastern Archipelago,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_645'>645</span>according to Mr. Crawford, this is a common mode of committing
theft and robbery.<a id='r2170' /><a href='#f2170' class='c013'><sup>[2170]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It is chiefly the fruit and seeds that have hitherto been examined;
but the whole plant is probably poisonous. Brandes discovered in
it a volatile, oleaginous, alkaline substance, which he supposed to
be its active principle.<a id='r2171' /><a href='#f2171' class='c013'><sup>[2171]</sup></a> But, though his observations were confirmed
by Bley,<a id='r2172' /><a href='#f2172' class='c013'><sup>[2172]</sup></a> it now appears that the real principle is a colourless, crystalline
alkaloidal substance, of an acrid taste like tobacco, which was
discovered more lately by Geiger and Hesse; this is named daturine,
or daturia.<a id='r2173' /><a href='#f2173' class='c013'><sup>[2173]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The physiological effects of the extract have been determined by
Orfila. He found that half an ounce killed a dog within twenty-four
hours after being swallowed, that a quarter of an ounce applied to a
wound killed another in six hours, and that thirty grains killed another
when injected into the jugular vein. The symptoms were purely
nervous, and not very prominent. Hence this poison, like the former,
acts through the blood-vessels, and probably on the brain.<a id='r2174' /><a href='#f2174' class='c013'><sup>[2174]</sup></a>
Bley’s daturia proves quickly fatal to small animals in the dose of a
few drops. The crystalline daturia of Geiger and Hesse kills a sparrow
in the dose of an eighth of a grain, and occasions great and persistent
dilatation of the pupil when applied to the eye.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Symptoms in Man.</i>—The symptoms produced by a poisonous dose
in man are variable. The leading features are great delirium, dilatation
of the pupils, and stupor; but sometimes spasms occur, and
occasionally palsy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Fowler has related the case of a little girl who took a drachm
and a half of the seeds. In less than two hours she was attacked
with maniacal delirium, accompanied with spectral illusions; and she
remained in this state most of the following night, but had some intervals
of lethargic sleep. Next morning, after the operation of a
laxative, she fell fast asleep, and after some hours she awoke quite
well.<a id='r2175' /><a href='#f2175' class='c013'><sup>[2175]</sup></a> In a case somewhat like this, related in Henke’s Journal,
the child had general redness of the skin, swelling of the belly, locked
jaw, tremors of the extremities, and an attitude and expression as if
about to tumble into a pit. Recovery took place after the action of
an emetic.<a id='r2176' /><a href='#f2176' class='c013'><sup>[2176]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In two instances, one related by Vicat in his treatise on the poisonous
plants of Switzerland,<a id='r2177' /><a href='#f2177' class='c013'><sup>[2177]</sup></a> the other by Dr. Swaine<a id='r2178' /><a href='#f2178' class='c013'><sup>[2178]</sup></a> in the Edin.
Phys. and Lit. Essays, the leading symptoms were furious delirium
and palsy of the whole extremities. In the instances of three children
related by Alibert there were delirium, restlessness, constant
incoherent talking, dancing and singing, with fever and flushed face.<a id='r2179' /><a href='#f2179' class='c013'><sup>[2179]</sup></a>
In another recorded by Dr. Young, there were some convulsions, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_646'>646</span>livid suffusion of the countenance.<a id='r2180' /><a href='#f2180' class='c013'><sup>[2180]</sup></a> In an instance communicated
to me by my colleague Dr. Traill, where eighteen or twenty grains
of extract of stramonium were taken by mistake for sarsaparilla, the
symptoms were dryness of the throat immediately afterwards, then
giddiness, dilated pupils, flushed face, glancing of the eyes, and incoherence,
so that he seemed to his friends to be intoxicated: and
subsequently there was incessant unconnected talking, like that of
demency. Emetics were given without effect, and little amendment
was obtained from blood-letting, leeches on the temples, cold to the
head, or purgatives. But after a glass of strong lemonade vomiting
took place, the symptoms began to recede, in ten hours he recognized
those around him, and next day he was pretty well. Kaauw
Boerhaave has related with great minuteness the case of a girl who
very nearly lost her life in consequence of a man having given her
the powder in coffee with the view of seducing her. The symptoms
were redness of the features, delirium, nymphomania, loss of speech;
then fixing of the eyes, tremors, convulsions, and coma; afterwards
tetanic spasm and slow respiration with the coma. She was with
much difficulty roused for a time by the operation of emetics, and
eventually got well after her lethargy had lasted nearly a day.<a id='r2181' /><a href='#f2181' class='c013'><sup>[2181]</sup></a> In
another related in Rust’s Magazin, and caused by a decoction of the
fruit, which was mistaken for thistle-heads, the leading symptoms
were spasmodic closing of the eyelids and jaws, spasms also of the
back, complete coma, and excessive dilatation and insensibility of the
pupil.<a id='r2182' /><a href='#f2182' class='c013'><sup>[2182]</sup></a> This case, which seems to have been a very dangerous one,
was rapidly cured by free blood-letting. Blood-letting, indeed, seems
peculiarly called for in poisoning with thorn-apple, on account of the
strong signs of determination of blood to the head.—Gmelin has
quoted several fatal cases, one of which endured for six hours only;<a id='r2183' /><a href='#f2183' class='c013'><sup>[2183]</sup></a>
and Dr. Young says, that a child has been killed by a single apple.<a id='r2184' /><a href='#f2184' class='c013'><sup>[2184]</sup></a>
The most complete account yet published of the phenomena of poisoning
with stramonium when fatal is given by Mr. Duffin of London.
A child of his own, two years old, swallowed about 100 seeds without
chewing them. Soon after she became fretful and like a person
intoxicated; in the course of an hour efforts to vomit ensued, together
with flushed face, dilated pupils, incoherent talking, and afterwards
wild spectral illusions and furious delirium. In two hours and
a half she lost her voice and the power of swallowing, evidently
owing to spasms of the throat. Then croupy breathing and complete
coma set in, with violent spasmodic agitation of the limbs, occasional
tetanic convulsions, warm perspiration, and yet an imperceptible
pulse. Subsequently the pulse became extremely rapid, the belly
tympanitic, and the bladder paralyzed, but with frequent involuntary
stools, probably owing to the administration of cathartics; and death
took place in twenty-four hours. At an early period twenty seeds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_647'>647</span>were discharged by an emetic: the stools contained eighty; and none
were found in the alimentary canal after death. There was never
any marked sign of congestion of blood in the head, except flushed
face at the beginning.<a id='r2185' /><a href='#f2185' class='c013'><sup>[2185]</sup></a> Dr. Droste of Osnaburg has related a fatal
case occasioned by a decoction of 125 seeds given to remove colic.
In fifteen minutes the patient became delirious, but soon fell apparently
fast asleep, and died in seven hours without again awaking.<a id='r2186' /><a href='#f2186' class='c013'><sup>[2186]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Dangerous effects may result from the application of the thorn-apple
to the skin when deprived of the cuticle. An instance has been lately
published of alarming narcotism from the application of the leaves to
an extensive burn.<a id='r2187' /><a href='#f2187' class='c013'><sup>[2187]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Morbid Appearances.</i>—As to the <i>morbid appearances</i>, Droste found
in his case redness of the cardiac end of the stomach, which contained
two table-spoonfuls of a pulpy matter mixed with black and white
grains, the remains of the teguments of the seeds; and there was also
lividity of the back, lividity of the lungs, emptiness of the cavities of
the heart, and gorging of the vessels of the brain. Haller says he once
found general congestion of the brain and sinuses,<a id='r2188' /><a href='#f2188' class='c013'><sup>[2188]</sup></a>—an appearance
which may naturally be expected, considering the signs of strong
determination of blood towards the head, which often prevail during
life. In Mr. Duffin’s case, however, the brain was healthy, not congested;
the stomach and intestines presented no morbid appearance;
and the only unusual appearances observed were a slight blush
over the pharynx, larynx, and upper third of the gullet, thickening
and swelling of the rima glottidis, and a semi-coagulated state of the
blood.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Tobacco.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>A plant of the same natural order with the two former, tobacco,
the <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> of botanists, is familiarly known to be in certain
circumstances a virulent poison. Every part of the plant possesses
active properties. It has been used as a poison in this country for
criminal purposes.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Vauquelin</i> analyzed it some time ago, and procured an acrid volatile
principle which he called nicotine.<a id='r2189' /><a href='#f2189' class='c013'><sup>[2189]</sup></a> This substance, which was
afterwards obtained in a purer state as a crystalline body by Hermbstädt,
has been more recently ascertained by MM. Posselt and Reimarus
to be nothing else than essential oil of tobacco, which is sold at
ordinary temperatures; and they succeeded in procuring another principle
which they consider the true nicotina. This is fluid at 29° F.,
volatile, extremely acrid, alkaline, and capable of forming crystallizable
salts with some of the acids.<a id='r2190' /><a href='#f2190' class='c013'><sup>[2190]</sup></a> Tobacco then appears to contain
an acrid alkaline principle, and an essential oil to which the alkaloid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_648'>648</span>adheres with great obstinacy. The relation of the empyreumatic oil
of tobacco to these principles has not been accurately ascertained,
though it probably contains one or other of them. It is well known
to be an active poison, which produces convulsions, coma and death.
Mr. Morries-Stirling found that its active part is removed from the oil
by washing with weak acetic acid, as he also observed in the instance
of similar oils obtained from various narcotic vegetables.<a id='r2191' /><a href='#f2191' class='c013'><sup>[2191]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Process for detecting Tobacco in Organic mixtures.</i>—In a medico-legal
case which happened at Aberdeen in 1834, and of which some
notice is taken at page <a href='#Page_651'>651</a>, Dr. Ogston of that city successfully employed
the following process for detecting tobacco in the contents of
the stomach. The contents, consisting of a pulpy fluid, were acidulated
with acetic acid, digested, and filtered; the liquid was treated
with diacetate of lead, filtered again, freed of lead by hydrosulphuric
acid, filtered a third time, treated with caustic potash, and then allowed
to settle. The supernatant liquid, which had the taste of tobacco-juice,
was separated and distilled to half its volume. The distilled
liquor had a strong tobacco odour and taste, and some acridity,
and gave a precipitate with infusion of galls. The residuum in the
retort presented oily particles on its surface, and when heated in an
open basin filled the apartment with a vapour which had a strong
odour of tobacco smoke, and caused in several persons present a sense
of acridity of the throat, watering of the eyes, and tendency to sneeze.
Various additional experiments confirmatory of these results were also
performed; and a simultaneous examination of tobacco-powder gave
precisely the same indications. I am indebted to Dr. Ogston for
these particulars and a detailed narrative of his investigation; which
appears to supply a convenient and conclusive process for the detection
of tobacco.—Perhaps the ordinary process for obtaining nicotina
may also be employed with advantage. This consists in distilling the
suspected substance with caustic potash, neutralizing the distilled
liquor with sulphuric acid, concentrating the product to a thin syrup,
exhausting this with etherized alcohol, evaporating off the solvent, and
distilling the extract with strong solution of potash. Nicotina passes
over, and may be recognized by its sensible and chemical qualities.</p>

<p class='c006'>The effects of tobacco are somewhat different from those of belladonna
and thorn-apple; but it is here arranged with them, as it
belongs to the same natural family. Orfila remarked that 5½ drachms
of common rappee, introduced into the stomach of a dog and secured
by a ligature, caused nausea, giddiness, stupor, twitches in the muscles
of the neck, and death in nine hours; and that two drachms and
a quarter applied to a wound proved fatal in a single hour. Mr. Blake
thinks tobacco has no direct action on the heart, even when admitted
directly into the blood by the jugular vein;—that it acts primarily on
the capillary circulation of the lungs, by obstructing which it prevents
the blood from reaching the left cavities of the heart, and thus acts
on that organ indirectly. For he observed, that laboured respiration
always preceded any sign of depressed action of the heart, that forcible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_649'>649</span>action of the heart often returned after its first cessation, and that
its contractility continued after death.<a id='r2192' /><a href='#f2192' class='c013'><sup>[2192]</sup></a> An infusion of ten grains
caused laborious breathing in ten seconds, and in twenty seconds temporary
arrestment of the heart’s action, which then returned, and was
attended for a time with increased arterial pressure. Soon afterwards
the animal recovered, without any convulsions or loss of sensibility.
Two scruples had the same effect. But when three drachms were
used, convulsions succeeded similar phenomena, and death ensued
in two minutes, the heart continuing to act for some time after respiration
had ceased, until at length it was stopped by the usual consequences
of asphyxia.<a id='r2193' /><a href='#f2193' class='c013'><sup>[2193]</sup></a> On the other hand, Sir B. Brodie found that
the effects are very different, according to the form in which the poison
is used. Thus four ounces of a strong infusion, when injected into
the anus of a dog, killed it in ten minutes by paralyzing the heart; for
after death the blood in the aortal cavities was arterial. But the empyreumatic
essential oil does not act in that manner: it excites convulsions
and coma, without affecting the heart. It may prove fatal
in two minutes.<a id='r2194' /><a href='#f2194' class='c013'><sup>[2194]</sup></a> Like other violent poisons, tobacco has no effect
when applied directly to the brain or nerves.<a id='r2195' /><a href='#f2195' class='c013'><sup>[2195]</sup></a> Two drops of the
alkaloid, nicotina, injected into the jugular vein of a dog, begin to act
in ten seconds, and will prove fatal in a minute and a half.<a id='r2196' /><a href='#f2196' class='c013'><sup>[2196]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Symptoms in Man.</i>—The effects observed in man are allied to those
produced in dogs by the infusion. In a slight degree they are frequently
witnessed in young men, while making their first efforts to acquire
the absurd practice of smoking. The first symptoms are acceleration
and strengthening of the pulse, with very transient excitement,
then sudden giddiness, fainting and great sickness, accompanied
with a weak, quivering pulse. These effects are for the most
part transient and trifling, but not always. Some degree of somnolency
is not uncommon. Dr. Marshall Hall has given an interesting
account of a young man who smoked two pipes for his first debauch,
and in consequence was seized with nausea, vomiting, and syncope,
then stupor, stertorous breathing, general spasms and insensible pupils.
Next day the tendency to faint continued, and in the evening
the stupor, stertor and spasms returned; but from that time he recovered
steadily.<a id='r2197' /><a href='#f2197' class='c013'><sup>[2197]</sup></a> Gmelin has quoted two cases of death from excessive
smoking,—caused in one by seventeen, in the other by eighteen
pipes, smoked at a sitting.<a id='r2198' /><a href='#f2198' class='c013'><sup>[2198]</sup></a> It is likewise mentioned by Lanzoni that
an individual fell into a state of somnolency and died lethargic on the
twelfth day in consequence of taking too much snuff;<a id='r2199' /><a href='#f2199' class='c013'><sup>[2199]</sup></a> Dr. Cheyne
says, “he is convinced apoplexy is one of the evils in the train of that
disgusting practice;”<a id='r2200' /><a href='#f2200' class='c013'><sup>[2200]</sup></a> and I have met with an instance where the
excessive use of snuff, occasioned twice, at distant intervals, an attack
<span class='pageno' id='Page_650'>650</span>resembling imperfect apoplexy, united with delirium. Such cases,
however, must be admitted to be rare; and the practice of taking snuff
is in general unattended with injury.</p>

<p class='c006'>Serious consequences have resulted from the application of tobacco
to the abraded skin. In the Ephemerides an account is given of three
children who were seized with giddiness, vomiting, and fainting from
the application of tobacco-leaves to the head for the cure of ring-worm.<a id='r2201' /><a href='#f2201' class='c013'><sup>[2201]</sup></a>
Dr. Merriman has also alluded to an instance of death in a child from
the incautious employment of a strong decoction of tobacco as a lotion
for ring-worm of the scalp.<a id='r2202' /><a href='#f2202' class='c013'><sup>[2202]</sup></a> And in Leroux’s Journal there is an
account of a man, who, after using a tobacco decoction for the cure
of an eruptive disease, was seized with symptoms of poisoning, and
died in three hours.<a id='r2203' /><a href='#f2203' class='c013'><sup>[2203]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In recent times poisoning with tobacco has been often produced by
the employment of too large doses in the way of injection. Richard
has mentioned a case, not fatal, which arose from an infusion of five
leaves in a choppin of water, used as an injection by a lady for costiveness.
She was immediately seized with colic, giddiness, buzzing
in the ears, headache, nausea, and then syncope of seven hours’
duration. During this period the breathing was difficult, the pulse
very slow, the pupils dilated, the skin cold and moist, the urine suppressed,
the efforts to vomit constant, and the belly depressed, contracted,
and affected with constant borborygmus. She recovered
under the use of emollient injections and fomentations.<a id='r2204' /><a href='#f2204' class='c013'><sup>[2204]</sup></a> Dr. Grahl
of Hamburg has related minutely a fatal case, which arose from an
ounce of rather more, boiled for fifteen minutes in water, and administered
by advice of a female quack. The individual, who laboured
merely under dyspepsia and obstinate costiveness, was seized in two
minutes with vomiting, violent convulsions, and stertorous breathing,
and died in three-quarters of an hour.<a id='r2205' /><a href='#f2205' class='c013'><sup>[2205]</sup></a> Another accident of the
same kind is noticed in the Journal de Chimie Médicale, where the
person became as it were intoxicated, and died immediately. Instead
of an infusion of two drachms she had used a decoction of two
ounces.<a id='r2206' /><a href='#f2206' class='c013'><sup>[2206]</sup></a>—M. Tavignot describes the following remarkable case occasioned
by a similar dose. An infusion prepared by mistake with two
ounces and one drachm, instead of a drachm and a half, was used as
an injection for a stout man affected with ascarides. In seven minutes
he was seized with stupor, headache, paleness of the skin, pain in
the belly, indistinct articulation, and slight convulsive tremors, at
first confined to the arms, but afterwards general. Extreme prostration
and slow laborious breathing soon ensued, and then coma,
which ended fatally in eighteen minutes.<a id='r2207' /><a href='#f2207' class='c013'><sup>[2207]</sup></a>—Even two drachms,
however, or a drachm and a half, are by no means a safe dose. An
<span class='pageno' id='Page_651'>651</span>anonymous writer in the Medical and Surgical Journal says a patient
of his died in convulsions an hour or two after receiving a clyster
composed of two drachms infused in eight ounces.<a id='r2208' /><a href='#f2208' class='c013'><sup>[2208]</sup></a> Nay, in the
Acta Helvetica there is an account by an anonymous writer of the
case of a woman, who, after an injection made with one drachm only,
was seized with pain in the belly, anxiety and faintings, proving
fatal in a few hours.<a id='r2209' /><a href='#f2209' class='c013'><sup>[2209]</sup></a> And a case, fatal in thirty-five minutes, which
was occasioned by the same dose, occurred not long ago in Guy’s
Hospital, London.<a id='r2210' /><a href='#f2210' class='c013'><sup>[2210]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Tobacco is an equally deadly poison when swallowed in large
quantity. M. Caillard has related the particulars of the case of a
lunatic, who, having swallowed half an ounce of snuff during a lucid
interval, was seized with vomiting, and afterwards with oppression,
incoherence, cold sweats, a slow full pulse, and dilated pupils; but
he slowly recovered.<a id='r2211' /><a href='#f2211' class='c013'><sup>[2211]</sup></a> The French poet Santeuil was killed in this
way by a practical joker at the Prince of Condé’s table. When the
bottle had circulated rather freely, a boxful of Spanish snuff was
emptied into a large glass of wine, and thus administered to the unlucky
victim, who was in consequence “attacked with vomiting and
fever, and expired in two days amidst the tortures of the damned.”<a id='r2212' /><a href='#f2212' class='c013'><sup>[2212]</sup></a>
The following important case has been communicated to me by Dr.
Ogston of Aberdeen, who was employed in the judicial investigations
connected with it. An elderly man, a pensioner, was seen to
enter a brothel, while in perfect health; and in an hour he was carried
out insensible and put down in a passage, where he was found
by the police unable to speak or move. While carrying him to the
watch-house hard by, the officers observed him attempt to vomit;
but he was scarcely laid down before the fire, when he expired. It
was ascertained, that he had drunk both rum and whisky in the
brothel, and that something had been given him “to stupefy him or
set him asleep.” On dissection the blood was found every where
very fluid, and four ounces of serosity were collected from the lateral
ventricles and base of the skull. But there was no other unusual
appearance, except that the stomach contained about four
ounces of a thick brownish pulp, in which were seen several pellets
of a powder resembling snuff. In these contents Dr. Ogston could
not detect any opium; but he detected tobacco by the process mentioned
above. No doubt could exist that the man died of poisoning
with tobacco; but as no evidence could be obtained to inculpate any
one in particular of many individuals who were in the brothel with
him, the case was not made the subject of trial.</p>

<p class='c006'>Evidence is not wanting, therefore, to prove that this plant is a
very active poison; yet every one knows that under the influence of
habit it is used in immense quantities over the whole world as an
article of luxury, without any bad effect having ever been clearly
traced to it. Its poisonous qualities were known in Europe as soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_652'>652</span>as it was brought from America; and the belief that such properties
could not fail to be attended, as in the case of spirits and opium,
with evil consequences from its habitual use, led to much opposition
on the part of various governments to its introduction. Soon after
it was brought to England by Sir W. Raleigh, King James wrote a
philippic against it, entitled “The Counter-blaste to Tobacco.” Some
countries even prohibited it by severe edicts. Amurath the 4th in
particular made the smoking of tobacco capital; several of the Popes
excommunicated those who smoked in the church of St. Peter’s; in
Russia it was punished with amputation of the nose; and in the Canton
of Bern it ranked in the tables next to adultery, and even so
lately as the middle of last century a particular court was held there
for trying delinquents.<a id='r2213' /><a href='#f2213' class='c013'><sup>[2213]</sup></a> Like every other persecuted novelty, however,
smoking and snuff-taking passed from place to place with rapidity;
and now there appear to be only two luxuries which yield to
it in prevalence, spirituous liquors and tea.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only accounts I have seen of the morbid appearances after
poisoning with tobacco are contained in the cases of Dr. Grahl and
Dr. Ogston. In the former there was great lividity of the back,
paleness of the lips, flexibility of the joints (two days after death),
diffuse redness of the omentum without gorging of vessels, similar
redness with gorging of vessels both on the outer and inner coats of
the intestines, in some parts of the mucous coat patches of extravasation,
unusual emptiness of the vessels of the abdomen; while the
stomach was natural, the lungs pale, the heart empty in all its cavities,
and the brain natural. The appearances in Dr. Ogston’s case
have been already stated.</p>

<p class='c006'>Writers on the diseases of artisans have made many vague statements
on the supposed baneful effects of the manufacture of snuff on
the workmen.<a id='r2214' /><a href='#f2214' class='c013'><sup>[2214]</sup></a> It is said they are liable to bronchitis, dysentery,
ophthalmia, carbuncles and furuncles. At a meeting of the Royal
Medical Society of Paris, however, before which a memoir to this
purport was read, the facts were contradicted by reference to the state
of the workmen at the Royal Snuff Manufactory of Gros-Caillou,
where 1000 people are constantly employed without detriment to
their health.<a id='r2215' /><a href='#f2215' class='c013'><sup>[2215]</sup></a> This subject was afterwards investigated with care
by MM. Parent-Duchatelet and D’Arcet, who inquired minutely into
the state of the workmen employed at all the great tobacco-manufactories
of France, comprising a population of above 4000 persons;
and the results at which they arrived are,—that the workmen very
easily become habituated to the atmosphere of the manufactory,—that
they are not particularly subject either to special diseases, or to
disease generally,—and that they live on an average quite as long
as other tradesmen.<a id='r2216' /><a href='#f2216' class='c013'><sup>[2216]</sup></a> These facts are derived from accurate statistical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_653'>653</span>returns, showing the number of days each person was annually
off work from sickness, the ages at which superannuated allowances
were granted, the period of death, and the prevalent diseases.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONS OF THE UMBELLIFEROUS ORDER OF PLANTS.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>The Natural Order <i>Umbelliferæ</i> contains a variety of plants, to
which narcotico-acrid properties have been at different times ascribed.
But these properties have been satisfactorily traced in the
instance of four species only, the <i>Conium maculatum</i>, <i>Œnanthe crocata</i>,
<i>Cicuta virosa</i>, and <i>Æthusa cynapium</i>. It is supposed that others may
be poisonous. But the facts on the subject are equivocal; for the
several species of the family are very apt to be confounded with one
another, and there is reason to think that other species have repeatedly
been mistaken for one of the four already mentioned.</p>

<p class='c006'>The symptoms caused by the umbelliferous narcotics comprehend
chiefly coma, convulsions, paralysis, and delirium. But the knowledge
possessed on this head is rather vague, and the phenomena are not
unfrequently complex and difficult to observe with accuracy; so that
their nature has been sometimes misunderstood. The irritant properties
of the poisons of this tribe of narcotico-acrids are seldom well
defined.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Hemlock.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The first to be mentioned is the common hemlock, or <i>Conium maculatum</i>,
one of the most abundantly diffused of umbelliferous vegetables.
It is distinguished from all those which it resembles by its
tall, smooth, spotted stem,—its smooth leaves,—the rugged edge
of the five ribs of its fruit,—its singular mousy odour,—and the
very peculiar odour of conia, emitted when the pulp or juice of the
leaves is mixed with caustic potash. The only other umbelliferous
native which has a spotted stem, the <i>Myrrhis temulenta</i>, is easily distinguished
from hemlock by the whole plant being very hairy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cases of poisoning with hemlock are not infrequent on the continent,
the root having been mistaken for fennel, asparagus, parsley,
but particularly parsnep.<a id='r2217' /><a href='#f2217' class='c013'><sup>[2217]</sup></a> It is generally believed to have furnished
the poison which was used in ancient times, and especially among
the Greeks, for despatching criminals; but we have not any precise
information on the subject.</p>

<p class='c006'>A peculiar alkaloid was indicated in hemlock not long ago by
Brandes, half a grain of which killed a rabbit with symptoms like
those of tetanus.<a id='r2218' /><a href='#f2218' class='c013'><sup>[2218]</sup></a> Other chemists were unable to obtain his results.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_654'>654</span>But the subject was afterwards taken up with success by Geiger, who
obtained from the plant a volatile, oleaginous alkaloid, which possesses
great energy as a poison.<a id='r2219' /><a href='#f2219' class='c013'><sup>[2219]</sup></a> Mr. Morries-Stirling procured from
hemlock by destructive distillation an empyreumatic oil similar in
properties to those of hyoscyamus, stramonium and tobacco, but producing
in animals a state of pure coma.<a id='r2220' /><a href='#f2220' class='c013'><sup>[2220]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The effects of hemlock on the animal system have been variously
described by different observers. Sometimes they have appeared to
be purely soporific like those of opium; at other times they have resembled
the effects of belladonna and thorn-apple; and in the lower
animals they are quite different, as I have witnessed them, from what
they have been described to be in man,—the phenomena being
simply those of asphyxia from paralysis of the muscles, without material
convulsions and without insensibility. Its irritant action is not
well established.</p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila observed that an ounce of the extract of the leaves killed a
dog in forty-five minutes when swallowed, ninety grains killed another
through a wound in an hour and a half, and twenty-eight grains
another through a vein in two minutes. It therefore acts by entering
the blood-vessels. The extract is a very uncertain preparation;
the reason of which is, that the alkaloid conia is very easily decomposed
in its natural state of mixture by heat or age, being converted
into an inert resinoid matter,—that the dried leaves of hemlock contain
scarcely any of it,—and that even an extract of the fresh leaves
contains little, unless prepared with a gentle heat, yet speedily.<a id='r2221' /><a href='#f2221' class='c013'><sup>[2221]</sup></a> The
symptoms remarked by Orfila were convulsions and insensibility; and
in the dead body the blood of the left cavities of the heart was sometimes
found arterial.—The result of my observations is quite at variance
with this statement. In various experiments with a strong extract
prepared from the green seeds with absolute alcohol, the only
effect I could remark were palsy, first of the voluntary muscles, next
of the chest, lastly of the diaphragm,—asphyxia in short from paralysis,
without insensibility, and with slight occasional twitches only
of the limbs, and the heart was always found contracting vigorously
for a long time after death. Thirty grains of a soft extract introduced
between the skin and muscles of the back killed a rabbit in
five minutes, and a five months’ puppy in twenty minutes.<a id='r2222' /><a href='#f2222' class='c013'><sup>[2222]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The root is much less energetic than is represented by some
authors, and probably varies in this respect at different seasons. I
have found that four ounces and a half of juice, the produce of
twelve ounces of roots collected in November, had no effect on a
dog when secured in its stomach by a ligature on the gullet; and
that four ounces obtained from ten ounces of roots in the middle of
June, when the plant was coming into flower, merely caused diarrhœa
and languor. Orfila had previously observed that three pounds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_655'>655</span>of roots had no effect in the month of April; but that two pounds
in the end of May, when the plant was in full vegetation, killed a
dog in six hours.<a id='r2223' /><a href='#f2223' class='c013'><sup>[2223]</sup></a> The alcoholic extract of the juice obtained from
six ounces of roots on the last day of May, I have found to kill a
rabbit in thirty-seven minutes, when introduced in a state of emulsion
between the skin and muscles of the back; and the effects
were analogous to those obtained with the extract of the leaves.
The differences depending on season will probably account for various
persons having found the juice of the root harmless. Gmelin quotes
an instance where four ounces of the juice were taken without injury.
He adds another where three ounces of the juice of the herb
were swallowed daily for eight days with as little effect. But, as he
judiciously observes, other less active plants have probably been
sometimes mistaken for hemlock.<a id='r2224' /><a href='#f2224' class='c013'><sup>[2224]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The alkaloid, conia, seems to be the active principle of hemlock,
and is a poison of extraordinary virulence. On investigating this
subject in 1835,<a id='r2225' /><a href='#f2225' class='c013'><sup>[2225]</sup></a> I found that it is a local irritant, possessing an
acrid taste, and capable of exciting redness or vascularity in any
membrane to which it is applied; but that these topical effects are
readily overwhelmed by its swift and intense narcotic action. This
action consists of swiftly spreading palsy of the muscles, which affects
first those of voluntary motion, then the respiratory muscles of the chest
and abdomen, and lastly the diaphragm, so as to terminate by causing
asphyxia. The paralytic state is usually interrupted from time to
time by slight convulsive twitches of the limbs and trunk at the beginning.
The muscular contractility is impaired or annihilated by
the topical action of the poison, but not by its indirect action through
absorption. The heart is not appreciably affected; for it contracts
vigorously long after all motion, respiration, and other signs of life
are extinct; and it contains after death, not florid but dark blood in
its left cavities. The blood undergoes no alteration. The external
senses are little, if at all impaired, until the breathing is almost
arrested; and volition too is retained. But a contrary inference
may be drawn by a careless observer, in consequence of the paralytic
state taking away the means, by which in animals sensation is expressed
and volition exercised. The action of conia, in short, is confined
to the spinal cord; and it acts as a sedative, by exhausting
the nervous energy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Conia is probably a deadly poison to all orders of animals: at
least I found it to be so to the dog, cat, rabbit, mouse, frog, fly, and
flea; and Geiger killed the kite, pigeon, sparrow, slow-worm, and
earth-worm with it. It acts through every texture where absorption
is carried on readily, through the stomach, eye, lungs, cellular tissue,
peritonæum, or veins; and its activity is in proportion to the speed
with which absorption is carried on in the part. It acts therefore
through absorption. Its activity is increased by neutralization with
an acid, by which it is rendered much more soluble in water. Few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_656'>656</span>poisons equal it in subtility and swiftness. A single drop, applied
to the eye of a rabbit, will kill it in nine minutes; and three drops
in the same way will kill a strong cat in a minute and a half. Five
drops, introduced into the throat of a little dog, began to act in
thirty seconds, and proved fatal in one minute. And when two
grains, neutralized with thirty drops of weak hydrochloric acid,
were injected into the femoral vein of a young dog, it died before
there was time to note the interval, so that only two or three seconds
at most had elapsed, before all internal signs of life were extinct.
This extraordinary rapidity of action seems incompatible with its
operation taking place by conveyance of the poison with the blood
to the spinal cord. Mr. Blake, as formerly mentioned (p. <a href='#Page_15'>15</a>), denies
that its action in this way was ever so swift in his hands, and
alleges that he could never observe the interval to be shorter than
fifteen seconds. If the reader, however, will consult the original account
of my experiment,<a id='r2226' /><a href='#f2226' class='c013'><sup>[2226]</sup></a> which was made along with Dr. Sharpey,
he will see that we could scarcely be mistaken as to the interval in
that instance.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Symptoms in Man.</i>—M. Haaf, a French army-surgeon, has described
a fatal case of poisoning with hemlock, which closely resembled poisoning
with opium. The subject of it, a soldier, had partaken along
with several comrades of a soup containing hemlock leaves, and appeared
to them to drop asleep not long after, while they were conversing.
In the course of an hour and a half they became alarmed
on being all taken ill with giddiness and headache; and the surgeon
of the regiment was sent for. He found the soldier, who had fallen
asleep, in a state of insensibility, from which, however, he could
be roused for a few moments. His countenance was bloated, the
pulse only 30, and the extremities cold. The insensibility became
rapidly deeper and deeper, till he died, three hours after taking the
soup.<a id='r2227' /><a href='#f2227' class='c013'><sup>[2227]</sup></a> His companions recovered.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Watson has briefly described two cases which were fatal in
the same short space of time. The subjects were two Dutch soldiers,
who, in common with several of their comrades, took broth
made with hemlock leaves and various other herbs. Giddiness,
coma, and convulsions were the principal symptoms. The men who
recovered were affected exactly as if they had taken opium.<a id='r2228' /><a href='#f2228' class='c013'><sup>[2228]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>When the dose is not sufficient to prove fatal, there is sometimes
paralysis, attended with slight convulsions, as in a case noticed by
Orfila.<a id='r2229' /><a href='#f2229' class='c013'><sup>[2229]</sup></a> More commonly there is frantic delirium. Matthiol has
related an instance of this last description, occurring in the cases of
a vine-dresser and his wife, who mistook the roots for parsneps
Both of them became in the course of the night so delirious that
they ran about the house, knocking themselves against every object
which came in their way.<a id='r2230' /><a href='#f2230' class='c013'><sup>[2230]</sup></a> Kircher, as quoted by Wibmer, tells a
parallel story of two monks who became so raving mad after eating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_657'>657</span>the roots, that they plunged into water, imagining that they were
turned into geese, and they were affected for three years with incomplete
palsy and neuralgic pains.<a id='r2231' /><a href='#f2231' class='c013'><sup>[2231]</sup></a> These and some other cases of
the like kind, recorded by the older medical authors, must be
received with reserve. Independently of other considerations, there
is often no certainty that the poison was really the hemlock of modern
botanists, and not some other umbelliferous vegetable.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Morbid Appearances.</i>—In Haaf’s case the vessels of the head
were much congested; and the blood must have been very fluid, for
on the head being opened a quantity flowed out, which twice filled
an ordinary chamber-pot. This state of the blood likewise occurred
in a case which I examined here some years ago along with Dr. C.
Coindet of Geneva. A hypochondriacal old woman took by advice
of a neighbour two ounces of a strong infusion of hemlock leaves
with the same quantity of whisky, which she swallowed in the
morning fasting. She died in an hour, comatose and slightly convulsed.
The vessels within the head were not particularly turgid;
but the blood was everywhere remarkably fluid. Dr. Coindet subsequently
found that a small portion of the infusion prevents fresh
drawn blood from coagulating; but I suspect there must have been
some mistake here, for a carefully prepared alcoholic extract of very
great power, which was used in my experiments alluded to above,
had no such effect on blood fresh drawn from rabbits and dogs. On
account of this extreme fluidity of the blood, it often flows from the
nose, but the skin is much marked with lividity.<a id='r2232' /><a href='#f2232' class='c013'><sup>[2232]</sup></a> The fluidity of
the blood is nothing more than the result of the proximate cause of
death,—slowly formed asphyxia.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Water-Hemlock.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Another plant of the order Umbelliferæ, the water-hemlock or
<i>Cicuta virosa</i>, possesses also great energy as a poison; and in its
effects it appears to resemble considerably the hydrocyanic acid.
The plant is indigenous. It is easily known from other umbelliferous
species inhabiting watery places by the peculiar structure of its
root-stock, which is not fleshy, but hollow, and composed of a number
of large cells with transverse plates.</p>

<p class='c006'>From a numerous set of experiments with the root of the cicuta
performed by Wepfer, it appears to cause true tetanic convulsions in
frequent paroxysms, and death on the third day.<a id='r2233' /><a href='#f2233' class='c013'><sup>[2233]</sup></a> Simeon ascertained
that the alcoholic extract of the root is very poisonous.<a id='r2234' /><a href='#f2234' class='c013'><sup>[2234]</sup></a> Schubarth
found that an ounce of the juice of the stems and leaves, collected
after the flowers had begun to blow, produced no effect on
the dog.<a id='r2235' /><a href='#f2235' class='c013'><sup>[2235]</sup></a> It is probably inert, or at all events feebly poisonous in
this climate, although it grows luxuriantly in many localities. I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_658'>658</span>found that twelve ounces of juice, expressed from sixteen ounces of
roots in the beginning of August, merely caused some efforts to
vomit, when secured in the stomach of a dog by a ligature on the
gullet; that the alcoholic extract of twelve ounces of leaves gathered
at the same time had no effect when introduced in the form of emulsion
between the skin and muscles of the back of a rabbit; and that
the alcoholic extract of two ounces of unripe seeds proved equally
inert when imployed in the same way.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Symptoms in Man.</i>—Wepfer has likewise related several instances
which occurred in the human subject. Among the rest he has described
the cases of eight children who ate the roots instead of parsneps.
Of those who were seriously affected, one, a girl six years
old, who ultimately recovered, had tetanic fits, followed by deep
coma, from which it was impossible to rouse her for twenty-four
hours. Two of them died. The first symptoms in these two were
swelling in the pit of the stomach, vomiting or efforts to vomit, then
total insensibility, with involuntary discharge of urine, and finally
severe convulsions, during which the jaws were locked, the eyes
rolled, and the head and spine were bent backwards, so that a child
might have crept between the body and the bed-clothes. One of
them died half an hour after being taken ill, and the other not long after.<a id='r2236' /><a href='#f2236' class='c013'><sup>[2236]</sup></a>
Mayer of Creutsburg mentions four cases, which were occasioned by
the roots. One of the individuals, a child three years old, was attacked
with colic, vomiting, and convulsions, and died in a few hours.
The three others, the eldest of whom was six years of age, had coldness,
paleness of the features, dilated immoveable pupils, violent
colic, general spasms, and insensibility. The action of the heart
was intermitting and the breathing oppressed. After the remains of
the roots were brought up by emetics, and infusion of gall was administered,
they gradually recovered. They had eaten between
them no more than a single root weighing about two ounces, as they
had in their possession another of that weight, which they said was
not so large. This accident happened in the middle of March.<a id='r2237' /><a href='#f2237' class='c013'><sup>[2237]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>According to Guersent, poisoning with the cicuta commences with
dimness of sight, giddiness, acute headache, anxiety, pain in the
stomach, dryness in the throat, and vomiting.<a id='r2238' /><a href='#f2238' class='c013'><sup>[2238]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Mertzdorff has related the particulars of the inspection of three cases
which proved quickly fatal with convulsions and vomiting. Nothing
remarkable seems to have been found except great gorging of the cerebral
vessels.<a id='r2239' /><a href='#f2239' class='c013'><sup>[2239]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Hemlock Dropwort.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The <i>Œnanthe crocata</i> of botanists, the hemlock dropwort, five-finger-root,
or dead-tongue of vernacular speech in England, a species
of the same family with the last two, and an abundant plant in
some localities throughout this country, has usually been held one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_659'>659</span>of the most virulent of European vegetables. It seems well entitled
to this character in general; but climate, or some other more obscure
cause, renders it inert in some situations.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is said to be liable to be confounded with common hemlock, or
<i>Conium maculatum</i>,—a mistake which can happen only in very ignorant
hands. It has smooth, dark-green leaves, more fleshy, and
much less minutely divided, than those of hemlock; it presents a
purplish appearance at the joints only of the stem, and no diffused
purple spots; its fruit is oblong and black, not round, rough, and
light brown; and its root, instead of being single, long, tapering, and
little branched, consists of from two to ten tubers, like fingers, which
are white, and terminate in a few rootlets. These tubers are formed annually
in summer from the flowering stem of the season, and send
out flowering stems the subsequent year. During the first autumn,
winter, and spring they are firm, white, and amylaceous; but in their
second summer they become more pulpy, less amylaceous, and grayer.
At all times they emit, when broken across, an oleo-resinous juice,
which quickly becomes yellow; this juice abounds most when the
plant, which is growing at their expense, is about to flower; and it
abounds much more at this period in localities in the south of England,
than in Scotland, especially in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh.</p>

<p class='c006'>Brotero and some others have attempted to subdivide the species
into two, the <i>Œnanthe crocata</i> proper, and the <i>Œ. apiifolia</i>. But the
best authorities deny that these can be distinguished; and from what
I have now seen in sundry localities, it appears to me that the distinctions
pointed out by Brotero, confessedly obscure enough in
themselves, are the result of differences in climate, soil, and situation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only analysis of this plant with which I am acquainted is one
executed in 1830 by MM. Cormerais and Pihan-Dufeillay, who found
in the root a resinoid matter, which adheres obstinately to the solid
portion of it, and which seems to be the active ingredient.<a id='r2240' /><a href='#f2240' class='c013'><sup>[2240]</sup></a> I have
subjected the roots to various processes, and among the rest to that
by which Geiger detected conia in hemlock, but without discovering
any indication of the existence of an alkaloid. My materials, however,
were not well fitted for a chemical analysis; because the
œnanthe root of this neighbourhood is inert or nearly so. The whole
plant contains a heavy-smelling volatile oil, which may be obtained
by distillation in the usual way, and most abundantly from the ripe
seeds. This oil is yellowish, viscid, and inert.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is strange that a plant, so universally considered a potent poison,
and so frequently the cause of fatal accidents, has not yet been made
the subject of physiological investigation. A few imperfect experiments
by M. Cormerais and his companion, made with the resinoid
matter of the roots, show that this substance produces in animals dulness,
convulsions of the voluntary muscles, a semi-paralytic state of
the hind legs, and sometimes shortness of breath, vomiting, and fluid
evacuations by stool. All the animals experimented on recovered.
On repeating these experiments with larger quantities I found the
resin of the root, grown near Woolwich, and kindly sent to me by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_660'>660</span>Dr. Pereira, to be a poison of great energy and singular properties.
Twenty-four grains obtained from eight ounces of roots in the middle
of December, when introduced in the form of emulsion between the
skin and muscles of the rabbit, caused in half an hour depression,
uneasiness, and hurried breathing,—then twitches of the ears, neck,
and fore-legs,—next combined spasm and convulsive starting of the
head and limbs,—then, after a quiet interval, a more violent fit of
the same kind, affecting the whole body with a singular combination
of tetanus and convulsive starting,—finally, after several such fits,
a paroxysm more violent than before, ending in immoveable tetanic
rigidity, which speedily proved fatal, 78 minutes after the application
of the poison. No morbid appearance could be detected in the
body. The heart contracted vigorously for some time after death.
These phenomena correspond in the main with what has been recorded
of the symptoms caused by the roots in man.—Dr. Pereira
informs me he had found the juice both of the root and leaves to act
as a poison, either when introduced into the peritonæum, or when
injected into the veins; and in the latter way it was so energetic as
to prove fatal in one minute.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Symptoms in Man.</i>—Since Lobel first took notice of the poisonous
properties of the œnanthe root in 1570, an uninterrupted series
of observations has been published, down to the present day,
showing that in France, Germany, Holland, Spain, and various parts
of England as far north as Liverpool, it is at all seasons of the year,
even in October and in the beginning of January, a poison of great
activity. In several of the cases death has been occasioned by a single
handful of the roots, in one instance by a piece no bigger than the finger,
or even in consequence of the individuals merely tasting them. A girl
seems to have had a narrow escape after eating, with an interval of three
hours, two pieces of the size of a walnut. Very seldom has death been
delayed beyond four hours, and on some occasions a single hour has
been sufficient. Sometimes the symptoms have been slow in making their
appearance, an hour and a half having occasionally elapsed before
the effects were evident; but in every instance their progress was
rapid, once the symptoms had fairly set in; and some died in convulsions
almost immediately after being taken ill.</p>

<p class='c006'>The particular effects have been variable. Most generally the
first symptoms have been giddiness and staggering, as if from ordinary
intoxication, occasionally headache, and often extreme feebleness
of the limbs. Stupor has then generally succeeded, sometimes
with the intervention of efforts to vomit, sometimes too with an interval
of delirium. Convulsions have also commonly made their
appearance in the next place; and ere long a state of insensibility
has ensued attended in every instance with occasional violent convulsive
fits like epilepsy, and with permanent locked-jaw; which
symptoms have continued till near death. In one or two cases the
individual has suddenly, without any premonitory symptoms, fallen
down convulsed, and died almost immediately. In one or two instances
again, the effects have rather been those of irritant poisoning,
namely, inflammation of the mouth and throat, spasms of the muscles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_661'>661</span>of the throat, vomiting, and excessive weakness and faintness, without
any convulsions or insensibility.—It appears then that this plant
is a true narcotico-acrid poison. The emanations from the plant are
said on some occasions to have proved injurious; but the effect here
was probably the work of the imagination.</p>

<p class='c006'>Aware of these singular properties being generally ascribed to the
<i>Œnanthe crocata</i>, I was anxious to make a methodical examination of
the subject, physiologically as well as chemically,—especially as the
plant grows in great abundance and very luxuriantly in a locality not
far from Edinburgh. But I have found it in that situation, to all
appearance, quite inert. The juice of fourteen ounces of the root in
the end of October had no effect on a little dog when secured in the
stomach by a ligature on the gullet. The juice of sixteen ounces in
the middle of June was also without effect. An alcoholic extract of
four ounces of the full grown leaves in the end of June, introduced
into the cellular tissue in the form of emulsion, had no effect
on a rabbit. An alcoholic extract of three ounces of the ripe seeds
was administered in the same way with the same result. Finally,
the resinoid extract of eight ounces of the root, analogous to that
which had proved so deadly in my hands when obtained from Woolwich
plants, had also no effect whatever, when prepared from those
growing in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh. Relying upon these
results, I ate a whole tuber weighing an ounce, without observing
any effect, except its disagreeable taste; which was the only circumstance
that prevented me from trying a larger quantity.—It may be
well to add, that, amidst the numerous cases of poisoning with œnanthe
now on record, there is not one that has occurred in Scotland. At
the same time, the common people in Scotland are not at all given
to rash experiments in cookery, or to make use of vegetables not
produced by the care of the gardener or farmer.<a id='r2241' /><a href='#f2241' class='c013'><sup>[2241]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The only other locality from which I have been hitherto able to
obtain plants for examination is the neighbourhood of Liverpool,
where a fatal case of poisoning with it occurred near the close of last
century. When the juice of sixteen ounces of this root in the beginning
of September was secured in the stomach of a dog, efforts to
vomit were produced, followed by several fits of violent convulsions
and spasm of the voluntary muscles, a paralytic state of the fore-legs,
and a constant tendency to fall backwards; but the animal recovered.</p>

<p class='c006'>No morbid appearances of any note have been observed after death
in any of the fatal cases which are recorded.—The most appropriate
treatment consists in the prompt employment of emetics, and diffusible
stimulants.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Fool’s Parsley.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Another umbelliferous plant of great activity is fool’s parsley, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_662'>662</span><i>Æthusa cynapium</i>. It has occasioned several accidents by reason of
its resemblance to parsley,—from which, however, it is at once
distinguished by the leaves being dark and glistening on their lower
surface, and by the nauseous smell they emit when rubbed. It contains
an alkaloid, which crystallizes in rhombic prisms, and is soluble
in water and alcohol, but not in ether. It was discovered by Professor
Ficinus of Dresden.<a id='r2242' /><a href='#f2242' class='c013'><sup>[2242]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila found that six ounces of the juice, when retained in the
stomach of a dog, by a ligature, caused convulsions and stupor, and
death in an hour.<a id='r2243' /><a href='#f2243' class='c013'><sup>[2243]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Symptoms in Man.</i>—Some interesting information on the characters
and properties of this plant is contained in the Medical and
Physical Journal. Among other cases the writer relates those of
two ladies who ate a little of it in a sallad instead of parsley, and who
were soon seized with nausea, vomiting, headache, giddiness, somnolency,
pungent heat in the mouth, throat, and stomach, difficulty in
swallowing and numbness of the limbs.<a id='r2244' /><a href='#f2244' class='c013'><sup>[2244]</sup></a> Gmelin has related the
case of a child, who died in eight hours in consequence of having
eaten the æthusa. The symptoms were spasmodic pain in the stomach,
swelling of the belly, lividity of the skin, and difficult breathing.<a id='r2245' /><a href='#f2245' class='c013'><sup>[2245]</sup></a>
In two children who recovered, the chief symptoms at the
height of the poisoning were complete insensibility, dilated, insensible
pupil, and staring of the eyes. In one of them there was also frequent
vomiting, in the other convulsions. The treatment consisted
in the administration of milk, sinapisms to the legs, and cold spunging
with vinegar.<a id='r2246' /><a href='#f2246' class='c013'><sup>[2246]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXV.<br /> <span class='small'>OF THE NARCOTIC RANUNCULACEÆ.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>The greater part of the poisons belonging to the Natural Family
<i>Ranunculaceæ</i> are acrid only in their action, and have been already
taken notice of among the irritants. Two only are yet known to possess
narcotic properties, namely, <i>monkshood</i>, and <i>black hellebore</i>. The
latter is a true narcotico-acrid. The former has till lately been always
considered so; but its acrid properties seem doubtful or feeble, while
its action on the nervous system is most intense.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Monkshood.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Monkshood, the <i>Aconitum napellus</i> of botanists, is an active poison,
and has commonly been considered a true narcotico-acrid. But
its effects have been hitherto much misunderstood. It has been used
for criminal purposes in Ireland; and in 1841, a woman, M’Conkey,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_663'>663</span>who was executed there for poisoning her husband, was proved to
have administered this substance [see p. <a href='#Page_61'>61</a>]. The root of another
species, the <i>A. ferox</i>, is well known to be in common use as a poison,
under the name of Bikh, in Bengal, and Nabee, in the Madras
Presidency.</p>

<p class='c006'>The toxicological history of the genus, and of this species in particular,
has been rendered complex and obscure, by the extreme difficulty
of distinguishing accurately the several species from one another.
The whole genus, now a numerous one, is generally conceived
to be eminently poisonous. But from some observations of
my own, as well as an elaborate inquiry, not yet made public, by Dr.
Alexander Fleming,<a id='r2247' /><a href='#f2247' class='c013'><sup>[2247]</sup></a> a recent graduate of this university, I am inclined
to think that this is a mistake, that the poisonous species are
not numerous, and that many aconites are inert, at least in this climate.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>A. napellus</i>, a doubtful native of Britain, and the most common
species in our gardens, shoots up annually a leafy stem from a
black, tapering, spindle-shaped root. The stem, which is from two
to five feet high, ends in a long dense spike of fine blue flowers; and
when the seeds ripen in autumn, it dies down, and the root also
shrivels and perishes. But in the spring, while the stem is rising,
one or more tubers form near the crown of the root; each tuber
quickly assumes the spindle-shaped form of its parent, but has a light
brown, instead of a brownish-black tegument; and when the plant
is in flower, the new tuber, destined for the root of next year’s plant,
is as large as the parent one, firmer, more amylaceous, and not so
apt to shrivel in drying. This mode of propagation has led some to
describe the root erroneously as sometimes palmated. Dr. Fleming
considers the young, full-grown tuber to be the most active part of
the plant; but the root of the existing plant, the leaves, and also the
seeds, are highly energetic; and every part is more or less so.</p>

<p class='c006'>Every part of the <i>A. napellus</i>, but especially the root, affects remarkably
the organs of taste, producing a very singular sense of
heat, numbness, and tingling of those parts of the mouth to which it
is applied. Dr. Fleming has ascertained, that this peculiar taste, or
rather sensation, is a property belonging to the narcotic principle of
monkshood, and that in all probability it is a measure of the activity
of the plant as a poison. It is most intense in the root, next in the
seeds, and next in the leaves before the flowers blow. Geiger first
ascertained, and I have since observed, that the sensation thus occasioned
by the leaves diminishes in intensity as the flowers expand,
and almost disappears when the seeds ripen. Contrary to what has
been often stated, it is not diminished by drying the leaves, even
with the heat of the vapour-bath. Nor is it materially lessened by
time, if the dried leaves be preserved with care; for I have found it
intense after six years. Geiger observed some years ago, that several
species or varieties do not possess it. I have ascertained that <i>A.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_664'>664</span>napellus</i>, <i>sinense</i>, <i>tauricum</i>, <i>uncinatum</i>, and <i>ferox</i>, possess it intensely,
<i>A. schleicheri</i> and <i>nasutum</i> feebly, <i>A. neomontanum</i> very
feebly; all of which are therefore probably poisonous, in proportion
to the intensity of their taste. <i>A. ferox</i>, well known as a deadly
poison in the East, and undoubtedly the most virulent of all the species,
produces by far the most intense and persistent effect on the
mouth of all the species I have had an opportunity of examining.
Those which do not produce it at all, at least in this climate, are <i>A.
paniculatum</i>, <i>lasiostomum</i>, <i>vulparia</i>, <i>variegatum</i>, <i>nitidum</i>, <i>pyrenaïcum</i>,
and <i>ochroleucum</i>. It would be premature to say that all these species
are inert; but I suspect they are: and, at all events, I have
ascertained that the leaves of <i>A. paniculatum</i>, although the officinal
species recognised in the London Pharmacopœia, are quite inactive
in this climate; and Dr. Fleming has found the root inert in medicinal
doses of considerable magnitude.</p>

<p class='c006'>The properties of monkshood have been traced by Geiger and
Hesse to a peculiar alkaloid, named aconitina: which is white,
pulverulent, fusible, not volatile, soluble in ether and alcohol,
sparingly so in water, and capable of forming crystallizable salts
with acids. It produces most intensely the peculiar impression
caused by the plant on the mouth, tongue, and lips; and it is a
poison of tremendous activity, probably indeed the most subtle of
all known poisons. Although not a volatile principle, it has been
supposed peculiarly liable to decomposition by heat, at least in its
natural state of combination in the plant or its pharmaceutic preparations.
This opinion is founded on the uncertainty of the medicinal
action of the common extract of the shops, and on the results of experiments
on animals by Orfila.<a id='r2248' /><a href='#f2248' class='c013'><sup>[2248]</sup></a> In one experiment he found that
half an ounce of the extract of the Parisian shops had no effect at
all on a dog, while a quarter of an ounce killed another within two
hours. Careless preparation may account for such differences; but
at the same time an error in choosing the species of plant is an
equally probable explanation. The properties of monkshood appear
to me to resist a heat of 212°, either in drying the plant or in preparing
an extract from it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The medico-legal chemistry of monkshood has not been studied.
If any of the suspected matter be obtained in a pure state, its best
character is its remarkable taste; to which I have found nothing
exactly similar in the numerous trials I have made with other narcotic
and acrid plants. A complex substance, such as the contents
of the stomach, or vomited matter, should be evaporated over the
vapour-bath to the consistence of thin syrup, and agitated with absolute
alcohol. The filtered alcoholic solution being then evaporated,
the extract may be subjected to the sense of taste.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Action.</i>—The action of monkshood is a subject of great interest,
but has hitherto been much misunderstood. Sir B. Brodie, who
was the first to examine it in recent times, found that the leading
phenomena in animals, were staggering, excessive weakness, slow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_665'>665</span>laborious respiration, and slight convulsive twitches before death.<a id='r2249' /><a href='#f2249' class='c013'><sup>[2249]</sup></a>
Had these observations been followed up by his successors with a
discriminating eye, toxicologists would not have been so much misled
as they have been. Orfila, who was the next to examine the
subject experimentally, failed to appreciate the phenomena with exactness.<a id='r2250' /><a href='#f2250' class='c013'><sup>[2250]</sup></a>
He thinks monkshood acts peculiarly upon the brain, causing
delirium, and that it is a local irritant, capable of developing more or
less intense inflammation. A single experiment made in 1836 convinced
me that the former statement is incorrect, and led me to consider that
the symptoms depend in a great measure on gradually-increasing
paralysis of the muscles, which terminates in immobility of the chest
and diaphragm, and consequent asphyxia. Dr. Pereira, in some
experiments with an alcoholic extract, published in 1842, took notice
of two remarkable phenomena,—an extraordinary diminution
of common sensation, evidenced by the animal being insensible
to pinching and pricking,—and the total absence of stupor, as shown
by the animal following its owner, and recognizing him when called.<a id='r2251' /><a href='#f2251' class='c013'><sup>[2251]</sup></a>
Similar observations have been made in poisoning with monkshood
in man. The ablest investigation yet undertaken into the actions of
this substance is contained in the unpublished Inaugural Dissertation
of Dr. Fleming.</p>

<p class='c006'>He found that the most remarkable symptoms are weakness and
staggering, gradually increasing paralysis of the voluntary muscles,
slowly increasing insensibility of the surface, more or less blindness,
great languor of the pulse, and convulsive twitches before death.
He farther observed that the pupil becomes much contracted; that
the irritability of the voluntary muscles is impaired; that the veins
are congested after death, the blood unaltered, and the heart capable
of contracting for some time after respiration has ceased. Lastly,
he maintains that this poison has not, as is generally thought, any
irritant properties, that neither the plant, nor its extract, nor its
alkaloid occasions vascularity in any membrane to which it is applied,
even, for example, in the lips or tongue while burning and
tingling from its topical action; that this peculiar effect is therefore
merely a nervous phenomenon; and that he never could observe
either the diffuse cellular inflammation described by Orfila to arise
from the application of monkshood to a wound, or the inflammatory
redness of the alimentary canal noticed by others as one of its effects
when swallowed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila ascertained that monkshood exerts its action through the
medium of the blood; for its effects are greater when it is introduced
into a wound, than when it is swallowed, and they are still
greater when it is injected directly into a vein. It is a poison of
very great activity. I have found that thirty grains of an alcoholic
extract, the produce of three-quarters of an ounce of fresh leaves,
will kill a rabbit in two hours and a quarter, if introduced between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_666'>666</span>the skin and muscles of the back. Five drachms of the root in one
of Orfila’s experiments with the dog, occasioned death in twenty-one
minutes, when swallowed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The alkaloid, aconitina, seems to produce in animals precisely the
same effects as the plant or its extract. Orfila and Dr. Pereira agree
in this; and my own observation, limited to a single experiment, is
to the same effect. It is probably the most subtile of all known
poisons. Dr. Pereira mentions that the fiftieth part of a grain has
endangered life when used medicinally.<a id='r2252' /><a href='#f2252' class='c013'><sup>[2252]</sup></a> In my experiment the
tenth of a grain, introduced in the form of hydrochlorate into the
cellular tissue of a rabbit, killed it in twelve minutes.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Symptoms in Man.</i>—A perplexing discrepance exists in the accounts
that have been published of the effects of monkshood on
man; which seems to have arisen, less from any actual contrariety
in the phenomena, than from loose observation, or a misunderstanding
of the facts; for most of the recent statements of competent observers
are consistent with one another.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Fleming says that in medicinal doses it occasions warmth in
the stomach, nausea, numbness and tingling in the lips and cheeks,
extending more or less over the rest of the body, diminution in the
force and frequency of the pulse, which sometimes sinks to 40 in the
minute, great muscular weakness, confusion of sight or absolute
blindness; and if the dose be unduly large, there is a sense of impending
death, sometimes slight delirium, and a want of power to
execute what the will directs, but without any loss of consciousness.
The warmth which is excited is unattended with any elevation
of temperature, vascularity of the skin, or acceleration of the
pulse. No true hypnotic effect is produced; but by inducing serenity,
or deadening pain, it may predispose to sleep. The highest
degree of these effects is not unattended with danger.</p>

<p class='c006'>When it is administered in doses adequate to occasion death, it
seems in general to operate by inducing extreme depression of the
circulation. Dr. Fleming recognizes two other modes of death in
animals,—first, by an overwhelming depression of the nervous system,
proving fatal in a few seconds, without arresting the action of
the heart,—and secondly, by asphyxia, or arrestment of the respiration,
the result of paralysis gradually pervading the whole muscular
system, respiratory, as well as voluntary. But these effects, he
thinks, cannot be recognized in the cases which have been published
of poisoning in man, because the dose required to produce either of
them is very large. The least variable symptoms in the human subject
are, first, numbness, burning, and tingling in the mouth, throat,
and stomach,—then sickness, vomiting, and pain in the epigastrium,—next,
general numbness, prickling, and impaired sensibility of the
skin, impaired or annihilated vision, deafness, and vertigo,—also
frothing at the mouth, constriction at the throat, false sensations of
weight or enlargement in various parts of the body,—great muscular
feebleness and tremor, loss of voice, and laborious breathing,—distressing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_667'>667</span>sense of sinking and impending death,—a small,
feeble, irregular, gradually-vanishing pulse,—cold, clammy sweat
and pale bloodless features,—together with perfect possession of
the mental faculties, and no tendency to stupor or drowsiness,—finally,
sudden death at last, as from hemorrhage, and generally in a
period varying from an hour and a half to eight hours. The symptoms
may begin in a few minutes, as in a case observed by Dr. Fleming,
which was occasioned by the tincture of the root; or they
may be postponed for three-quarters of an hour, as in an instance recorded
by Dr. Pereira,<a id='r2253' /><a href='#f2253' class='c013'><sup>[2253]</sup></a> which arose from the root being used by
mistake for horse-radish. Two or three drachms of the root are sufficient
to kill a man; and Dr. Fleming mentions one instance where
two grains of the alcoholic extract occasioned alarming effects, and
another where four grains proved fatal. I may observe, however,
that I have given six grains of a carefully prepared alcoholic extract
(the same of which thirty grains killed a rabbit in little more than
two hours), to a female suffering from rheumatism, without being
able to observe any effect whatsoever.</p>

<p class='c006'>If all the reports of cases now on record are to be trusted, the
following anomalies have occurred. Some persons are said to have
presented convulsions. Slight spasmodic twitches of the muscles
are not uncommon, and probably depend, as Dr. Fleming suggests,
on venous congestion, the result of incomplete asphyxia. Stupor
and even apoplectic insensibility are also sometimes represented to have
been observed. If really ever present, they must depend on the same
cause; but there is reason to apprehend, that extreme nervous depression
and faintness have been mistaken for stupor and coma.
Delirium of the frantic kind, mentioned by some of the older
authors, is justly considered by Dr. Fleming to be of doubtful occurrence,
as it has never been observed in recent times. Irritation
in the alimentary canal is distinctly mentioned as indicated by prominent
symptoms, even in some cases observed but a few years ago,
and apparently with care. Dr. Fleming properly objects to nausea,
vomiting, or pain in the epigastrium as evidence of irritation in the
stomach; for these symptoms may all depend on the same local nervous
impression which is produced on the organs of taste. And he
denies that purging is ever produced in any genuine case of poisoning
with monkshood. The following, however, seem unequivocal
examples of irritation in the alimentary canal. M. Pallas<a id='r2254' /><a href='#f2254' class='c013'><sup>[2254]</sup></a> mentions,
that three out of five persons, who took a spirituous infusion of the
root by mistake for lovage [<i>Ligusticum levisticum</i>], died in two
hours with burning in the throat, vomiting, colic, swelling of the
belly and purging. A similar set of cases is described by M. Degland.<a id='r2255' /><a href='#f2255' class='c013'><sup>[2255]</sup></a>
Four persons took the tincture of the root by mistake for
tincture of lovage; and three of them were seized with burning
pain from the throat to the stomach, a sense of enlargement of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_668'>668</span>tongue and face, colic, tenderness of the belly, vomiting, and
purging. One of these, who ultimately recovered, had frantic delirium
for some time after the other symptoms went off. The two
others died, one in two hours, the other half an hour later. Dr.
Pereira<a id='r2256' /><a href='#f2256' class='c013'><sup>[2256]</sup></a> and Dr. Fleming doubt the authenticity of these cases; and
it may be, that such unusual symptoms may have arisen either from
some other root mistaken by the narrators for monkshood, or from
irritant substances given along with or after it. At the same time I
may mention, that in the first trials I made with monkshood as a medicine,
using a carefully prepared extract of the root, I was deterred
from proceeding by two patients being attacked with severe vomiting,
griping, and diarrhœa.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be well to conclude these general statements by the particulars
of a few well authenticated cases. Dr. Pereira describes two
that were occasioned by the root having been dug up in February by
mistake for horse-radish.<a id='r2257' /><a href='#f2257' class='c013'><sup>[2257]</sup></a> The parties, a gentleman and his wife,
ate, the former about a root and a half, the latter not much more than
half a root. Both of them in three-quarters of an hour had burning,
and numbness in the lips, mouth, and throat, extending to the stomach
and followed by vomiting. The husband had subsequently violent
and frequent vomiting, partly owing to an emetic. His extremities
became cold, the lips blue, the eyes glaring, and the head covered
with cold sweat. There was no spasm or convulsion, but some tremor.
He had no delirium, or stupor, or loss of consciousness, but
complained of violent headache. The respiration was not affected;
and although he felt very weak, he was able to walk with a little assistance
only a few minutes before death; which took place, as if from
fainting, about four hours after the poison was swallowed.—His
wife, in addition to the early symptoms already mentioned, had such
weakness and stiffness of the limbs that she was unable to stand; and
she could utter only unintelligible sounds; but she had no spasms or
convulsions. She experienced a strange sensation of numbness in the
hands, arms, and legs, diminution of sensibility over the whole integuments,
especially of the face and throat, where the sense of touch was
almost extinguished. She had also some dimness of vision, giddiness,
and at times an approach to loss of consciousness, but no delirium,
sleepiness, or deafness. She recovered, under the use of emetics,
laxatives, and stimulants. In neither of these cases was there any
diarrhœa.—A patient of Mr. Sherwen,<a id='r2258' /><a href='#f2258' class='c013'><sup>[2258]</sup></a> five minutes after taking a
tincture of the root, suffered from the same incipient symptoms as
above, but without actual vomiting. The face seemed to her to swell,
and the throat to contract; she became nearly blind, and excessively
feeble, but did not lose her consciousness. The eyes were fixed and
protruded, and the pupils contracted, the jaws stiff, the face livid,
the whole body cold, the pulse imperceptible, the heart’s action feeble
and fluttering, and the breathing short and laborious. An emetic was
followed first by violent convulsions, and then by vomiting; after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_669'>669</span>which she slowly recovered. At all times she was so sensible as to
be able to tell how the accident happened.—Dr. Ballardini of Brescia
met with twelve simultaneous cases of poisoning with the juice of the
leaves, used by mistake for scurvy-grass [<i>Cochlearia officinalis</i>]. Each
person had three ounces of juice. Three of them died in two hours;
but the rest were saved. The chief symptoms were extreme weakness
and anxiety, paleness and distortion of the features, dilatation of
the pupils, dulness of the eyes, giddiness, headache, chiefly occipital,
some distension and pain of the belly, vomiting of a green matter,
and in some diarrhœa. The whole body was cold, the nails livid, the
limbs cramped, the pulse small and scarcely perceptible. In the
fatal cases there were convulsions.<a id='r2259' /><a href='#f2259' class='c013'><sup>[2259]</sup></a>—MM. Pereyra and Perrin mention,
that, while using the alcoholic extract in the Hospital of St.
André at Bordeaux, the sample of the drug happened to be changed
when the dose had been raised so high as ten grains; and that the
patients who were taking it were then all seized with burning in the
mouth and throat, vomiting, pungent pains in the extremities, cold
sweating, anxiety, extreme general prostration, great slowness and
irregularity of the pulse, convulsions, and congestion in the venous
system. One patient died; the others recovered under no other treatment
than stimulant friction along the spine.<a id='r2260' /><a href='#f2260' class='c013'><sup>[2260]</sup></a> An infant at Suippe,
in the French Department of the Marne, ate a few leaves and flowers
of monkshood, while walking in a garden. Soon afterwards he began
to stagger as if tipsy, and to complain of pain in the belly. In two
hours an emetic was given; but a few minutes afterwards, the eyes
became convulsed, the jaws locked, the trunk bent rigidly backward,
and the limbs convulsed; and death ensued in five minutes
more.<a id='r2261' /><a href='#f2261' class='c013'><sup>[2261]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Morbid Appearances.</i>—In Ballardini’s fatal cases the pia mater and
arachnoid were much injected; there was much serosity under the
arachnoid and in the base of the cranium; the lungs were considerably
gorged with blood; the heart and great vessels contained but a
little black fluid blood: the villous coat of the stomach was spotted
with red points; and the small intestines presented inwardly red
patches and much mucus. In the Bordeaux case there was venous
congestion in the head and chest, the lungs particularly being much
gorged with blood. The right side of the heart was full of blood, of
gelatinous consistence. In Pallas’s cases the gullet, stomach, small
intestines and rectum were very red, the lungs dense, dark, and
gorged, and the cerebral vessels turgid.</p>

<p class='c006'>Few trustworthy observations have been made on the effects of the
other species of aconite. Dr. Pereira found the A. ferox of the East
Indies to be a much more deadly poison to animals than common
monkshood; but its effects were otherwise identical.<a id='r2262' /><a href='#f2262' class='c013'><sup>[2262]</sup></a> Three grains
of the root put into the throat of a rabbit, killed it in nineteen minutes;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_670'>670</span>one grain of the alcoholic extract, introduced into the peritonæum,
proved equally deadly. Nine grains will kill a cat in four
hours.<a id='r2263' /><a href='#f2263' class='c013'><sup>[2263]</sup></a>——Of the other aconites the A. cammarum, and A. lycoctonum
are said to have proved fatal frequently in Germany; but
no accurate facts on the subject are on record.—It was stated above
that the A. paniculatum, supposed by De Candolle to have been the
true aconite of Baron Störck, is inert in this country. I introduced
the alcoholic extract of three ounces of the fresh leaves collected near
the end of June, into the cellular tissue between the skin and muscles
of a young rabbit, having previously converted the extract into an
emulsion with mucilage and water. This was four times the dose of
A. napellus, which I had found sufficient to kill a strong adult rabbit
in two hours and a quarter; but no effect whatever was produced.—Mr.
Ramsay of Broughty Ferry has described a case of fatal poisoning
with a handful of aconite leaves which were mistaken for parsley, and
which he supposes to have been those of A. neomontanum. The subject,
a boy of fourteen, was attacked with a sense of burning in the
mouth, throat, and stomach, afterwards with vomiting and convulsions,
and died considerably within five hours.<a id='r2264' /><a href='#f2264' class='c013'><sup>[2264]</sup></a> The very feeble
taste of this species—which besides is little cultivated in Scotland,—inclines
me to doubt whether it was the species that produced such
violent effects.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Black Hellebore.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Black hellebore, or Christmas-rose, the <i>Helleborus niger</i> of botanists,
is a true narcotico-acrid poison. It is a doubtful native of this country.
It produces a large white ranunculus-like flower about midwinter.
The root, the only part used in medicine, or to be found in
the shops, consists of a short root-stock and numerous, long, black
undivided rootlets. The fresh root in January is not acrid to the taste.
Its active principle appears from the researches of MM. Feneulle and
Capron, to be an oily matter containing an acid.<a id='r2265' /><a href='#f2265' class='c013'><sup>[2265]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Its action has not yet been examined with particular care. Two
or three drachms of the root killed a dog in eighteen hours, when
swallowed; two drachms killed another in two hours, when applied
to a wound; and six grains in a wound caused death in twenty-three
hours. In all cases the leading symptoms are efforts to vomit, giddiness,
palsy of the hind-legs, and insensibility.<a id='r2266' /><a href='#f2266' class='c013'><sup>[2266]</sup></a> Ten grains of the
extract introduced into the windpipe killed a rabbit in six minutes.<a id='r2267' /><a href='#f2267' class='c013'><sup>[2267]</sup></a>
Orfila found redness of the rectum, when the animals survived a few
hours. But none of these experiments show the powerful irritant
action exerted by the root upon man.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Bulletins of the Medical Society of Emulation mention two
cases of poisoning with hellebore, which arose from the ignorance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_671'>671</span>a quack doctor. Both persons, after taking a decoction of the root,
were seized in forty-five minutes with vomiting, then with delirium,
and afterwards with violent convulsions. One died in two hours
and a half, the other in less than two hours.<a id='r2268' /><a href='#f2268' class='c013'><sup>[2268]</sup></a> Morgagni has related
a case which proved fatal in about sixteen hours, the leading symptoms
of which were pain in the stomach, and vomiting. The dose
in this instance was only half a drachm of the extract.<a id='r2269' /><a href='#f2269' class='c013'><sup>[2269]</sup></a> In a case
not fatal, related by Dr. Fahrenhorst, the symptoms were those of
irritant poisoning generally, that is, burning pain in the stomach and
throat, violent vomiting, to the extent of sixty times in the first two
hours, cramps of the limbs, and cold sweating. The most material
symptoms were at this time quickly subdued by sinapisms to the
belly and anodyne demulcents given internally; and in four days the
patient was well. The dose here was a table-spoonful of the root in
fine powder.<a id='r2270' /><a href='#f2270' class='c013'><sup>[2270]</sup></a> In small doses of ten or twenty grains, it is well
known to be a powerful purgative to man. I have known severe
griping produced by merely tasting the fresh root in January.</p>

<p class='c006'>The morbid appearances in Morgagni’s case were the signs of
inflammation in the digestive canal, particularly in the great intestines.
In the case described in the French Bulletins, there was
gorging of the lungs, and the stomach had a brownish-black colour
as if gangrenous.</p>

<p class='c006'>The other species of hellebore have not been carefully examined;
but it is probable that they all possess similar properties. The <i>H.
hyemalis</i> and <i>viridis</i> are said by Buchner to be weaker than the <i>H.
niger</i>; and the <i>H. fœtidus</i> is the most poisonous of all.<a id='r2271' /><a href='#f2271' class='c013'><sup>[2271]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING WITH SQUILL, MEADOW-SAFFRON, WHITE HELLEBORE, AND FOXGLOVE.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>The natural family <i>Liliaceæ</i>, and the allied family, <i>Melanthaceæ</i>,
contain many species which possess narcotico-acrid properties. Those
which are best known in Europe are squill, meadow-saffron, cevadilla,
and white hellebore. To these may be added foxglove, as
possessing properties in some measure analogous, and also rue and
ipecacuan.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Squill.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The root of the squill, or <i>Squilla maritima</i>, possesses the properties
of the narcotico-acrids. Orfila’s experiments on animals, indeed,
assign to it only an action on the nervous system. He found that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_672'>672</span>two ounces and a half of the fresh root, when secured in the stomach
of a dog by a ligature on the gullet, excited efforts to vomit, dilated
pupil, and lethargy; and in two hours the animal suddenly fell down
in a violent fit of tetanus, and expired. From thirty-six grains injected
into the jugular vein no effect followed for sixteen hours;
when at last, as in the former case, the animal dropped down convulsed
and died immediately.<a id='r2272' /><a href='#f2272' class='c013'><sup>[2272]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The effects, however, caused by squill on man leave no doubt that
it is also an active irritant; for it causes sickness, vomiting, diarrhœa,
gripes, and bloody urine, when given in over-doses. It has likewise
produced narcotic symptoms in man. Lange mentions an instance
of a woman, who died from taking a spoonful of the root in
powder to cure tympanitis. She was immediately seized with violent
pain in the stomach; and in a short time expired in convulsions.
The stomach was found every where inflamed, and in some parts
eroded.<a id='r2273' /><a href='#f2273' class='c013'><sup>[2273]</sup></a>—A woman, whose case is mentioned in a French journal,
after taking from a female quack a vinous tincture made with seventy-five
grains of extract of squill, was seized with nausea and severe
colic, to which were added in twenty-four hours a small contracted
pulse, extreme tenderness of the belly, and cold extremities; and she
died in the course of the second day.<a id='r2274' /><a href='#f2274' class='c013'><sup>[2274]</sup></a> Twenty-four grains of the
powder have proved fatal.<a id='r2275' /><a href='#f2275' class='c013'><sup>[2275]</sup></a> I have seen a quarter of an ounce of
the syrup of squills, which is a common medicinal dose, cause severe
vomiting, purging, and pain.</p>

<p class='c006'>An acrid principle, named scillitin, has been discovered in the
squill. A difference of opinion prevails as to its nature. Some
chemists consider it to be a resin; but Landerer has obtained it in
the crystalline form, with alkaline properties. A grain of it will
kill a dog.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with White Hellebore and Cevadilla.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>White hellebore, the root-stock of <i>Veratrum album</i>, and cevadilla,
the seed and capsules of <i>Asagræa officinalis</i>, and possibly of <i>Veratrum
sabadilla</i>, seem to be characteristic examples of the narcotico-acrid
poisons. They both possess a strong bitter taste, followed by acridity.
The cevadilla-seed in particular has an intensely disagreeable
and persistent bitter taste, and produces at the same time a combination
of acridity and numbness of the lips, tongue, and cheeks.
They owe their active properties chiefly to an alkaloid of great
energy, termed veratria.</p>

<p class='c006'>White hellebore root is familiarly known to be a virulent poison.
The best account of its effects is contained in a Thesis by Dr. Schabel,
published at Tübingen in 1817. Collecting together the experiments
previously made by Wepfer, Courten, Viborg, and Orfila,
and adding a number of excellent experiments of his own, he infers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_673'>673</span>that it is poisonous to animals of all classes,—horses, dogs, cats,
rabbits, jackdaws, starlings, frogs, snails, and flies;—that it acts in
whatever way it is introduced into the system,—by the stomach,
rectum, windpipe, nostrils, pleural membrane of the chest, an external
wound, or the veins;—that it produces in every instance symptoms
of irritation in the alimentary canal, and injury of the nervous
system;—and that it is very active, three grains of the extract applied
to the nostrils of a cat having killed it in sixteen hours.<a id='r2276' /><a href='#f2276' class='c013'><sup>[2276]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Symptoms in Man.</i>—Its effects on man are similar. A singular
account of several cases of poisoning with the root is contained in
Rust’s Journal. A family of eight people, in consequence of eating
bread for a whole week, in which the powder of the root had been
introduced by mistake instead of cumin seeds, were attacked with
pains in the belly, a sensation as if the whole intestines were wound
up into a clue, swelling of the tongue, soreness of the mouth, and
giddiness; but they all recovered by changing the bread and taking
gentle laxatives.<a id='r2277' /><a href='#f2277' class='c013'><sup>[2277]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Another set of cases of a more aggravated nature, though still not
fatal, is given in Horn’s Archives.<a id='r2278' /><a href='#f2278' class='c013'><sup>[2278]</sup></a> Three people took the root by
mistake for galanga. The symptoms that ensued were characteristic
of its double action. In an hour they all had burning in the throat,
gullet, and stomach, followed by nausea, dysuria, and vomiting;
weakness and stiffness of the limbs; giddiness, blindness, and dilated
pupil; great faintness, convulsive breathing, and small pulse. One
of them, an elderly woman, who took the largest share, had an imperceptible
pulse, stertorous breathing, and total insensibility even to
ammonia held under the nose. Next day she continued lethargic,
complained of headache, and had an eruption like flea-bites. A
fatal case is quoted by Bernt from Schuster’s Medical Journal. A
man took twice as much as could be held on the point of a knife,
was attacked with violent and incessant vomiting, and lived only
from morning till night. The gullet, stomach, and colon were here
and there inflamed.<a id='r2279' /><a href='#f2279' class='c013'><sup>[2279]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>No detailed inquiry has yet been made respecting the properties of
cevadilla; but there can be no doubt that it will prove an energetic
poison, similar in its effects to white hellebore, and probably more
active. Wibmer quotes Villemet for the fact, that half a drachm of
the seeds excites vomiting and convulsions in the cat and dog, and
Lentin for the case of a child, who died in convulsions in consequence
of the powder having been used inwardly and outwardly.<a id='r2280' /><a href='#f2280' class='c013'><sup>[2280]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The alkaloid, veratria, has been made the subject of experiment
by various physiologists. The most complete investigation yet undertaken
is that of Dr. Esche;<a id='r2281' /><a href='#f2281' class='c013'><sup>[2281]</sup></a> who found that it causes in a few
minutes restlessness, anxiety, salivation, slowness and irregularity of
the pulse, slow respiration, nausea, violent vomiting, borborygmus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_674'>674</span>spasms of the abdominal muscles and brisk purging of watery mucus,
often tinged with blood;—that by and by the muscles become extremely
feeble, so that the animal cannot support itself;—that coldness
of the surface succeeds, together with spasmodic contractions of
the throat, face, and extremities, but without any stupor;—and that
finally the respiration and pulse gradually become extinguished, extreme
prostration ensues, and death takes place in a fit of tetanic
spasm. No particular morbid appearance was found in the dead
body, and especially no sign of inflammation. Magendie found, that
one grain in the form of acetate killed a dog in a few seconds when
injected into the jugular vein, and in nine minutes when injected
into the peritonæum; and that the principal symptom in such rapid
cases was tetanic spasm.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Meadow-Saffron.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The <i>Colchicum autumnale</i>, meadow-saffron, or autumn-crocus, is
a more familiar poison in this country than white hellebore, and seems
to possess very similar properties. Two parts of the plant are met
with in the shops, the <i>cormus</i> or bulb, and the seeds; both of which
are poisonous. Both have a strong, disagreeable, persistent, bitter
taste. The seeds, and probably the bulb also, contain a bitter crystalline
principle, called colchicina, which is soluble in water, neutralizes
acids, and possesses intense activity as a poison.</p>

<p class='c006'>A good physiological investigation into the action of colchicum as
a poison is still wanting. Baron Störck found that two drachms of
the dried bulb caused in dogs violent diarrhœa and diuresis, ending
fatally.<a id='r2282' /><a href='#f2282' class='c013'><sup>[2282]</sup></a> Sir Everard Home observed that the active part of about
two drachms dissolved in sherry, caused in a dog, when injected
into the jugular vein, slow respiration, languor of the pulse, vomiting,
diarrhœa, extreme prostration, and death in five hours.<a id='r2283' /><a href='#f2283' class='c013'><sup>[2283]</sup></a>—Geiger
and Hesse, the discoverers of colchicina, gave a cat a tenth of a
grain, which occasioned salivation, vomiting, purging, staggering, extreme
languor, colic, and death in twelve hours.<a id='r2284' /><a href='#f2284' class='c013'><sup>[2284]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The effects of colchicum on man, like those observed in animals,
rather associate it with the acrid than with the narcotic poisons.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the Edinburgh Journal a case is briefly noticed of a man who
took by mistake an ounce and a half of the wine of the bulb, and
died in forty-eight hours, after suffering much from vomiting, acute
pain in the stomach, colic, purging, and delirium.<a id='r2285' /><a href='#f2285' class='c013'><sup>[2285]</sup></a>—Chevallier has
described a similar case arising from the wine of the bulb having
been given intentionally as a poison. In a few minutes burning
pain, urgent thirst, and frequent vomiting of mucus ensued; and
death took place in three days.<a id='r2286' /><a href='#f2286' class='c013'><sup>[2286]</sup></a>—Three American soldiers, who
drank by mistake a large quantity of colchicum wine prepared from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_675'>675</span>the bulb, died with similar symptoms. One of them, who took
eighteen ounces, and died in two days, presented the leading symptoms
of malignant cholera, namely, frequent vomiting, copious rice-water
stools, cramps of the abdominal muscles and flexion of the extremities,
coldness of the skin, tongue, and breath, blueness of the
nails, dull, sunken eyes, contracted pupils, and collapse of the features.
The two others had at first similar symptoms, which passed
into those of chronic dysentery, and proved fatal in a few weeks.<a id='r2287' /><a href='#f2287' class='c013'><sup>[2287]</sup></a>—M.
Caffe has related the case of a young lady who destroyed herself
by taking five ounces of the wine containing the active matter of
rather more than the fourth part of one bulb. She was soon seized
with acute pain in the stomach, then with frequent vomiting, general
coldness and paleness, a sense of tightness in the chest and oppression
of the breathing, a slow thready pulse, and extreme prostration,—and
subsequently with severe and constant cramps in the soles of the
feet. In eleven hours she had less frequent efforts to vomit, but was
excessively exhausted; in twenty hours the pulse was imperceptible;
and in two hours more she died. There was no suppression of
urine, no purging, no diminution of sensibility, delirium, convulsions,
or change in the state of the pupils.<a id='r2288' /><a href='#f2288' class='c013'><sup>[2288]</sup></a> About a twelvemonth
afterwards the sister of this patient put an end to herself with the
same preparation, of which she took the same quantity; and she died,
with precisely the same symptoms, in twenty-eight hours.<a id='r2289' /><a href='#f2289' class='c013'><sup>[2289]</sup></a> M.
Ollivier met with two cases of death within twenty-four hours, in
consequence of a tincture being taken which contained the active part
of forty-eight grains of the dry bulb; and a third case of death in
three days caused by three doses of a watery decoction made each
time with 46 grains of the bruised bulb collected in July. Severe
purging and prostration followed each dose. There was no symptom
of any affection of the brain.<a id='r2290' /><a href='#f2290' class='c013'><sup>[2290]</sup></a>—Mr. Henderson describes a case occasioned
by an ounce of the tincture. No injury accrued for three
hours. The patient then had gnawing pain in the stomach followed
by vomiting, and then by purging, at first bilious, afterwards watery,
and attended with numbness in the feet, and subsequently a sense of
prickling. In the course of the second day there was intense gnawing
pain in all the joints of the extremities, profuse acid sweating,
tightness in the head, and pain in the hindhead and nape of the
neck. Blood-letting, laxatives, and hyoscyamus were employed
with success; but the case seems very nearly to have proved fatal.<a id='r2291' /><a href='#f2291' class='c013'><sup>[2291]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The seeds produce similar effects. Bernt has noticed the cases of
two children who were poisoned by a handful of colchicum seeds, and
who died in a day, affected with violent vomiting and purging.<a id='r2292' /><a href='#f2292' class='c013'><sup>[2292]</sup></a>
Mr. Fereday of Dudley relates a carefully detailed case of a man
who died in forty-seven hours after swallowing by mistake two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_676'>676</span>ounces of the wine of the seeds, and in whom the symptoms were
acute pain, coming on in an hour and a half, then retching, vomiting,
and tenesmus, feeble pulse, anxious expression, afterwards incessant
coffee-coloured vomiting, suppression of urine, excessive weakness
of the limbs and feeble respiration, and, for a short period before
death, profuse, dark, watery purging. There was neither insensibility
nor convulsions.<a id='r2293' /><a href='#f2293' class='c013'><sup>[2293]</sup></a>—Blumhardt relates a similar case caused by
an infusion of a large table-spoonful of the seeds. In three-quarters
of an hour the man was seized with griping, and then profuse diarrhœa
and vomiting. Next morning, twelve hours after the poison was
taken, his physician found him still affected with vomiting and purging,
but not with pain. He seemed, indeed, to suffer so little, and
to improve so much under the use of emollients, that he was thought
to be fairly recovering. But next day the pulse was almost imperceptible,
the countenance and extremities were cold, the voice hoarse,
the breathing hurried, the eyes sunk, the pupils dilated, the epigastrium
tender, and the forehead affected with pain; and he died at
twelve the same day.<a id='r2294' /><a href='#f2294' class='c013'><sup>[2294]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The leaves, too, are poisonous. Dr. Bleifus has related a case in
proof of this. A man gathered the leaves in the middle of May, and,
after cooking them, ate about two ounces for supper. In six hours
he was seized with violent colic, vomiting, and purging. In fifteen
hours, when his physician first saw him, the countenance was ghastly
as in malignant cholera, the pupils dilated and scarcely contractile,
but the mind entire. He complained of rheumatic pains in the neck,
and burning pain in the pit of the stomach. He had frequent vomiting
and purging, spasms of the muscles of the belly, coldness of the
skin, a slow, small, wiry pulse, and cramps of the fingers and the
calves of the legs. Coffee and lemon-juice allayed the vomiting,
and a temporary amendment ensued. But early on the third morning
he became worse, and soon afterwards the narrator of the case
found him dying.<a id='r2295' /><a href='#f2295' class='c013'><sup>[2295]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The flowers are not less poisonous than the bulbs, leaves, and
seeds. A case is noticed in Geiger’s Journal of poisoning with a decoction
of some handfuls of the flowers, where death occurred within
twenty-four hours, under incessant colic, vomiting and purging.<a id='r2296' /><a href='#f2296' class='c013'><sup>[2296]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Doubts exist as to the degree of activity of colchicum. Some
practitioners direct half an ounce of the tincture of the seeds to be
given as a medicinal dose,<a id='r2297' /><a href='#f2297' class='c013'><sup>[2297]</sup></a> even four times a day.<a id='r2298' /><a href='#f2298' class='c013'><sup>[2298]</sup></a> Others administer
from one to two drachms night and morning. According to
more general experience, these are dangerous doses. Dr. Lewins,
junior, has seen dangerous symptoms from a drachm given thrice a
day for a week;<a id='r2299' /><a href='#f2299' class='c013'><sup>[2299]</sup></a> a fatal case occurred a few years ago in the Edinburgh
Infirmary, from this amount having been given for a few days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_677'>677</span>only; I have known very violent effects produced by half an ounce
taken by mistake, although most of it was brought away by emetics
in an hour; and, in medical practice, I have seldom seen the dose of
a sound preparation gradually raised to a drachm thrice a day, without
such severe purging and sickness ensuing as rendered it prudent
to diminish or discontinue the remedy. There is no doubt, however,
that larger doses have occasionally been taken without any ill effect.
Constitutional peculiarity can alone account for such differences in
the instance of the tincture of the seeds. As to the preparations of
the bulb, an additional source of diversity of effect is a difference in
the activity of the bulb according to season. On this point no accurate
facts have yet been brought forward. The bulb is usually
directed to be gathered in July, when it is most plump and firm, and
most charged with starch. Orfila, however, says that three bulbs, collected
at this time, had no effect whatever on a dog;<a id='r2300' /><a href='#f2300' class='c013'><sup>[2300]</sup></a> and Buchner maintains
that it is most energetic in the autumn, when the flowering stem
is rising.<a id='r2301' /><a href='#f2301' class='c013'><sup>[2301]</sup></a> I suspect, on the other hand, that it is very energetic in the
spring, when it is watery, more membranous, and shrivels much in
drying; for it is then very bitter.</p>

<p class='c006'>The morbid appearances are chiefly those of inflammation of the
alimentary canal.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the bodies of the children mentioned by Bernt there was considerable
redness of the stomach and small intestines; in Geiger’s
case inflammation of the stomach and duodenum only; in the case
mentioned in the Edinburgh Journal, and in that related by Chevallier,
there was no morbid appearance at all to be found. In Mr. Fereday’s
case the omentum was curled and folded up between the stomach
on the one hand, and the liver and diaphragm on the other;
the stomach and intestines were coated with much mucus; there was no
appearances of inflammation there but on two points, one in the stomach,
the other in the jejunum, where a red patch appeared, owing
to blood effused between the muscular and peritoneal coats; the
bladder was empty, the pleura red, the lungs much gorged, their surface,
as well as that of the diaphragm and heart, covered with ecchymosed
spots; and the skin over most of the body presented patches
of a purple efflorescence.—In Blumhardt’s case the muscles were
rigid twenty-three hours after death; the heart and great vessels contained
coagulated blood; the cardiac end of the gullet was internally
dark-violet; the stomach externally of a clear violet hue, and its
veins turgid; the gall-bladder turgid with greenish-yellow bile; and
the inner membrane of the whole small intestines chequered here and
there with red, inflamed-like spots.<a id='r2302' /><a href='#f2302' class='c013'><sup>[2302]</sup></a>—In one of M. Caffe’s cases
there was congestion of the cerebral vessels, coagulated blood in the
heart, uniform grayness, softness, and brittleness of the mucous coat
of the stomach, and enlargement of the muciparous follicles of the
small intestines, as well as unusual distinctness and lividity of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_678'>678</span>Peyerian glands. In the other case putrefaction was so far advanced
in forty-eight hours as to make the appearances equivocal.</p>

<p class='c006'>The treatment consists in evacuation of the stomach and bowels by
emetics and oleaginous laxatives in the early stage, and afterwards
in the employment of opium, stimulants, the warm bath, and occasionally
blood-letting.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Foxglove.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Foxglove, or <i>Digitalis purpura</i>, a plant which is common in this
country both as a native and in gardens, possesses powerful and peculiar
properties. The leaves are considered its most active part. They
contain an alkaloid; but chemists have not fixed its nature with precision.
M. Le Royer of Geneva procured a pitchy, deliquescent, uncrystallizable
substance;<a id='r2303' /><a href='#f2303' class='c013'><sup>[2303]</sup></a> but more lately M. Pauguy obtained a principle
in fine acicular crystals, soluble in alcohol and ether, but insoluble
in water, alkaline in its reaction, and of a very acrid taste.
This principle is called digitalin.<a id='r2304' /><a href='#f2304' class='c013'><sup>[2304]</sup></a> It seems to be the same substance,
which has also been detected by Radig, as quoted by Dr. Pereira.<a id='r2305' /><a href='#f2305' class='c013'><sup>[2305]</sup></a>
The leaves, like those of other narcotic vegetables, yield by
destructive distillation an empyreumatic oil similar in chemical qualities
and physiological effects to the empyreumatic oil of hyoscyamus.<a id='r2306' /><a href='#f2306' class='c013'><sup>[2306]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>From an extensive series of experiments on animals by Orfila with
the powder, extract and tincture of the leaves, foxglove appears to
cause in moderate doses vomiting, giddiness, languor, and death in
twenty-four hours, without any other symptoms of note; but in larger
doses, it likewise produces tremors, convulsions, stupor and coma.
It acts energetically both when applied to a wound, and when injected
into a vein.<a id='r2307' /><a href='#f2307' class='c013'><sup>[2307]</sup></a> Mr. Blake has inferred from his researches, that
when injected into the jugular vein, it occasions both obstruction of
the pulmonary capillaries, and direct depression of the heart’s action.
In the dog an infusion of three drachms of leaves arrested in five
seconds the action of the heart; which was motionless after death,
turgid, inirritable, and full of florid blood in its left cavities. An infusion
of an ounce, injected back into the aorta from the axillary
artery, caused in ten seconds great obstruction of the systemic capillaries,
indicated by sudden increase of arterial pressure in the hæmadynamometer;
the heart was unaffected for forty-five seconds, when
it became slow in its pulsations, and the arterial pressure diminished;
and in four minutes the heart ceased to beat, although for a little
longer it continued excitable by stimulation. As no affection of the
brain or spine was apparent before the heart became affected, the author
infers that the action depends on the poisoned blood being circulated
through the substance of the heart, and not on any intermediate influence
upon the nervous centre.<a id='r2308' /><a href='#f2308' class='c013'><sup>[2308]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_679'>679</span><i>Symptoms in Man.</i>—Upon man its effects as a poison have been
frequently noticed, partly in consequence of its being given by mistake
in too large a dose as a medicine, partly on account of the singular
property it possesses, in common with mercury, of accumulating
silently in the system, when given long in moderate doses, and at
length producing constitutional effects even after it has been discontinued.
The effects of a dose somewhat larger than is usually
given, are great nausea, frontal headache, sense of disagreeable dryness
in the gums and pharynx, some salivation, giddiness, weakness
of the limbs, feebleness and increased frequency of the pulse, in a few
hours an appearance of sparks before the eyes, and subsequently dimness
of vision, and a feeling of pressure on the eyeballs. These
effects may be occasioned by so small a dose as two or three grains
of good foxglove.<a id='r2309' /><a href='#f2309' class='c013'><sup>[2309]</sup></a> The symptoms arising from its gradual accumulation
are in the slighter cases nausea, vomiting, giddiness, want of
sleep, sense of heat throughout the body, and of pulsation in the
head, general depression, great languor and commonly retardation
of the pulse, sometimes diarrhœa, sometimes salivation, and for the
most part profuse sweating. A good instance of this form of the
effects of foxglove is mentioned in the Medical Gazette. A man
took it at his own hand for dropsy during twenty days, when the
pulse sank to half its previous frequency, he was seized with restless,
want of sleep, incoherent talking with imaginary persons,
dilated pupils, nausea, thirst, and increase of urine; and these
complaints did not materially subside for six days.<a id='r2310' /><a href='#f2310' class='c013'><sup>[2310]</sup></a> The depressed
action of the heart may be the occasion of death in particular circumstances.
Mr. Brande mentions from the experience of Dr. Pemberton
the case of an elderly woman, who, while under the full influence
of foxglove, fell in a fainting fit on walking across the
floor; after which, although she at first got better, there were frequent
attacks of fainting and vomiting till she died.<a id='r2311' /><a href='#f2311' class='c013'><sup>[2311]</sup></a> In other instances
convulsions also occur; and it appears from a case mentioned
by Dr. Blackall, that the disorder thus induced may prove
fatal. One of his patients, while taking two drachms of the infusion
of the leaves daily, was attacked with pain over the eyes and
confusion, followed in twenty-four hours by profuse watery diarrhœa,
delirium, general convulsions, insensibility, and an almost
complete stoppage of the pulse. Although some relief was derived
from an opiate clyster, the convulsions continued to recur in frequent
paroxysms for three weeks; in the intervals he was forgetful
and delirious; and at length he died in one of the convulsive fits.<a id='r2312' /><a href='#f2312' class='c013'><sup>[2312]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>A case which exemplifies the effects of a single large dose is related
in the Edinburgh Journal. An old woman drank ten ounces
of a decoction made from a handful of the leaves in a quart of
water. She grew sick in the course of an hour, and for two days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_680'>680</span>she had incessant retching and vomiting, with great faintness and cold
sweats in the intervals, some salivation and swelling of the lips, and
a pulse feeble, irregular, intermitting, and not above 40. She had
also suppression of urine for three days.<a id='r2313' /><a href='#f2313' class='c013'><sup>[2313]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>A somewhat similar instance may be found in the Journal de Médecine.
A man, fifty-five years old took by mistake a drachm instead
of a grain for asthma, and was attacked in an hour with vomiting,
giddiness, excessive debility, so that he could not stand, loss of
sight, colic, and slow pulse. These effects continued more or less for
four days, when the vomiting ceased; and the other symptoms then successively
disappeared, the vision, however, remaining depraved for
nearly a fortnight.<a id='r2314' /><a href='#f2314' class='c013'><sup>[2314]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>A very interesting fatal case, which arose from an over-dose administered
by a quack doctor, and which became the ground of a
criminal trial at London in 1826, is shortly noticed in the same Journal.
Six ounces of a strong decoction when taken as a laxative early
in the morning. Vomiting, colic, and purging, were the first symptoms;
towards the afternoon lethargy supervened; about midnight
the colic and purging returned; afterwards general convulsions made
their appearance; and a surgeon, who saw the patient at an early
hour of the succeeding morning, found him violently convulsed, with
the pupils dilated and insensible, and the pulse, slow, feeble, and irregular.
Coma gradually succeeded, and death took place in twenty-two
hours after the poison was swallowed.<a id='r2315' /><a href='#f2315' class='c013'><sup>[2315]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>This is the only case in which I have seen an account of the appearances
in the dead body, and they are related imperfectly. It is
merely said that the external membranes of the brain were much
injected with blood, and the inner coat of the stomach red in some
parts.</p>

<p class='c006'>The affections induced by poisoning with digitalis are often much
more lasting than the effects of most other vegetable narcotics. Dr.
Blackall’s case is one instance in point, and another no less remarkable
in its details is described in Corvisart’s Journal. The usual local
and constitutional symptoms were produced by a drachm of the
powder being taken by mistake; and the slowness of the pulse did
not begin to go off for seven days, the affection of the sight not for
five days more.<a id='r2316' /><a href='#f2316' class='c013'><sup>[2316]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The preparations of foxglove are very uncertain in strength. From
what I have observed in the course of their medicinal employment, I
conceive few powders retain the active properties of the leaves, and
even not many tinctures. Two ounces of the tincture of the London
College have been taken in two doses with a short interval between
them, yet without causing any inconvenience.<a id='r2317' /><a href='#f2317' class='c013'><sup>[2317]</sup></a> This assuredly could
not happen with a sound preparation.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_681'>681</span>
  <h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Rue.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The <i>Ruta graveolens</i>, or rue, although its wild variety is expressly
declared by Dioscorides to be mortal when taken too largely, has attracted
little attention as a poison in recent times, and is indeed
scarcely considered deleterious. Orfila seems to have found it by
no means active; for the juice of two pounds of leaves, secured in
the stomach of a dog by tying the gullet, did not prove fatal till the
second day, the symptoms were not well marked, and the only appearances
in the dead body were the signs of slight inflammation in
the stomach. Even when the distilled water was injected into a
vein, the only effects were a temporary nervous disorder similar to
intoxication.<a id='r2318' /><a href='#f2318' class='c013'><sup>[2318]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>According to the late experimental inquiry, however, by M. Hélie,<a id='r2319' /><a href='#f2319' class='c013'><sup>[2319]</sup></a>
rue is possessed of peculiar and energetic properties. All parts of
its organization, especially the roots and leaves, produce the effects
of the narcotico-acrid poisons; and although he never met with any
instance of a fatal result, its activity is such as to render this
event not improbable, even when the dose is by no means very
large. His attention was drawn to the subject in consequence of
finding, that it was often employed in his neighbourhood for producing
abortion,—a property ascribed to it immemorially by the
country people of France; and all the instances he has seen of its
poisonous action were cases in which it had been given with this
object. Sometimes the juice of the leaves is given, sometimes an
infusion of them, sometimes a decoction of the root; and in one instance
a woman took a decoction of two roots, each about as thick as
the finger. The effects were, severe pain in the stomach, followed by
violent and obstinate vomiting, drowsiness, giddiness, confusion,
dimness of sight, difficult articulation, staggering, contracted pupils,
convulsive movements of the head and arms, like those of chorea,
retention of urine, slowness of the pulse, and great prostration.
There was never any purging. In the course of two days or a little
more miscarriage took place, preceded by the usual precursors, and
followed by abatement of the symptoms of poisoning. At the period
of the milk-fever, however, these symptoms again increased, and the
patient was also attacked with swelling and pain in the tongue and
copious salivation. In about ten days the pulse began to increase
in frequency; and a mild typhoid fever commonly succeeded, from
which recovery took place slowly. In another case the symptoms
throughout their whole course were so mild, that, although miscarriage
occurred, the subject of it was not confined to bed, and in fifteen
days recovered her health completely. M. Hélie adds, that with full
knowledge of the doubts entertained by eminent authorities, whether
any substance whatever possesses a peculiar property of inducing miscarriage,
he is strongly persuaded that rue is really a substance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_682'>682</span>the kind, and that it will take effect even when there is no natural tendency
to miscarriage, or any particular weakness of constitution.</p>

<p class='c006'>Notwithstanding these statements, it may be suspected that M.
Hélie has overrated both its poisonous properties and its virtues as a
drug capable of inducing miscarriage.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Ipecacuan.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Ipecacuan is well known as an emetic. It is procured from a plant
of the natural family Rubiaceæ, the <i>Cephaëlis ipecacuanha</i>. It contains
a peculiar principle, not yet crystallized, which is white, permanent in
the air, sparingly soluble in water, easily soluble in alcohol and ether,
fusible about 122° F., capable of forming crystallizable salts with
acids, and possessing an alkaline reaction on litmus. It was discovered
by M. Pelletier.<a id='r2320' /><a href='#f2320' class='c013'><sup>[2320]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Ipecacuan itself is not known to be a poison; because in consequence
of its emetic properties it is quickly discharged from the
stomach. But in doses of considerable magnitude it would probably
be dangerous. In some constitutions the odoriferous effluvia from
the powder induce difficult breathing, anxiety, and imperfect convulsions.
I have met with several instances of this singular idiosyncrasy,
and one in particular where the subject of it, a surgeon’s apprentice,
suffered so often and so severely as to be induced to abandon
the medical profession. A German physician, Dr. Prieger, has published
a remarkable case of a druggist’s servant, who, in consequence
of incautiously inhaling the dust of ipecacuan powder, was
attacked with a sense of tightness in the chest, vomiting, and soon
after an alarming sense of suffocation from tightness of the throat.
When these symptoms had continued several hours the uneasiness in
the throat was removed after the use of a decoction of uva-ursi and
rhatany-root; but the dyspnœa remained several days.<a id='r2321' /><a href='#f2321' class='c013'><sup>[2321]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Its active principle, emeta, is a powerful poison. Two grains of
the pure alkaloid will kill a dog; and the symptoms are frequent vomiting,
followed by sopor and coma, and death in fifteen or twenty-four
hours. In the dead body the lungs and stomach are found inflamed.
The same effects result from injecting it into a vein, or applying it to
a wound.<a id='r2322' /><a href='#f2322' class='c013'><sup>[2322]</sup></a> It appears, then, to be a narcotico-acrid. But its irritant
properties are so prominent that it might be properly arranged
with the vegetable acrids.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXVII.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING WITH STRYCHNIA, NUX VOMICA, AND FALSE ANGUSTURA.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>The next group of the narcotico-acrids includes a few vegetable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_683'>683</span>poisons that act in a very peculiar manner. They induce violent
spasms, exactly like tetanus, and cause death during a fit, probably
by suspending the respiration. But they do not impair the sensibility.
During the intervals of the fits the sensibility is on the contrary
heightened, and the faculties are acute.</p>

<p class='c006'>Death, however, does not always take place by tetanus. In some
cases the departure of the convulsions has been followed by a fatal
state of general and indescribable exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c006'>Besides thus acting violently on the nervous system, they also
possess local irritant properties; but these are seldom observed on
account of the deadliness and quickness of their remote operation on
the spine and nerves.</p>

<p class='c006'>They exert their action by entering the blood-vessels. The dose
required to prove fatal is exceedingly small. The organ acted on is
chiefly the spinal cord; but sometimes they seem also to act on the
heart.</p>

<p class='c006'>They seldom leave any morbid appearances in the dead body.
Like the other causes of death by obstructed respiration, such as
drowning and strangling, they produce venous congestion; but this
is frequently inconsiderable. Sometimes, however, they leave signs
of inflammation in the alimentary canal.</p>

<p class='c006'>Their energy resides in peculiar alkaloids. The only poisons included
in this group, are derived from the genus <i>Strychnos</i>. The
bark of <i>Brucea antidysenterica</i> was long supposed also to possess
similar properties; but it is now known that the bark of <i>Strychnos
nux-vomica</i> was mistaken for the bark of that tree.</p>

<p class='c006'>Several species of <i>Strychnos</i> have been examined, namely, the <i>S.
Nux-vomica</i>, the <i>S. Sancti Ignatii</i> or St. Ignatius bean, the <i>S. colubrina</i>,
or snake-wood, the <i>S. tieuté</i>, which yields an Indian poison
the Upas tieuté, the <i>S. Guianensis</i>, and likewise the <i>S. potatorum</i>
and <i>Pseudo-kina</i>; and all have been found to possess the same remarkable
properties, except the last two, which are inert.</p>

<p class='c006'>All of them, except the <i>S. pseudo-kina</i>, and probably the <i>S. potatorum</i>,<a id='r2323' /><a href='#f2323' class='c013'><sup>[2323]</sup></a>
contain an alkaloid to which their poisonous properties are
owing. This is <i>strychnia</i> or strychnin, a substance which has lately
been made the subject of many experiments by chemists and physiologists.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Strychnia.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Strychnia was discovered by Pelletier and Caventou soon after
the discovery of morphia.<a id='r2324' /><a href='#f2324' class='c013'><sup>[2324]</sup></a> For an account of the best process for
preparing it, the reader may consult a paper by M. Henry in the
journal quoted below.<a id='r2325' /><a href='#f2325' class='c013'><sup>[2325]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Its leading properties are the following. Its crystals when pure
are elongated octaedres. It has a most intensely bitter taste, perceptible,
it is said, when a grain is dissolved in 80 pounds of water.<a id='r2326' /><a href='#f2326' class='c013'><sup>[2326]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_684'>684</span>It is very sparingly soluble in water, but easily soluble in alcohol and
the volatile oils. Its alcoholic solution has an alkaline reaction. It
forms neutral and crystallizable salts with the acids. In its ordinary
form it is turned orange-red by the action of nitric acid; which tint
becomes violet-blue on the gradual addition of hydrosulphate of
ammonia. The action of nitric acid is owing to the presence of a
yellow colouring matter, or of another alkaloid, brucia, which is
also contained in nux vomica, but exists in larger quantity in the
false angustura bark. Pure strychnia is not turned orange-red by
nitric acid.<a id='r2327' /><a href='#f2327' class='c013'><sup>[2327]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>No poison is endowed with more destructive energy than strychnia.
I have killed a dog in two minutes with a sixth part of a grain injected
in the form of alcoholic solution into the chest; I have seen a
wild-boar killed in the same manner with the third of a grain in ten
minutes; and there is little doubt that half a grain thrust into a
wound might kill a man in less than a quarter of an hour. It acts
in whatever way it is introduced into the system, but most energetically
when injected into a vein. The symptoms produced are very
uniform and striking. The animal becomes agitated and trembles,
and is then seized with stiffness and starting of the limbs. These
symptoms increase till at length it is attacked with a fit of violent
general spasm, in which the head is bent back, the spine stiffened,
the limbs extended and rigid, and the respiration checked by the
fixing of the chest. The fit is then succeeded by an interval of calm,
during which the senses are quite entire or unnaturally acute. But
another paroxysm soon sets in, and then another and another, till at
length a fit takes place more violent than any before it; and the
animal perishes suffocated. The first symptoms appear in 60 or 90
seconds, when the poison is applied to a wound. When it is injected
into the pleura, I have known them begin in 45 seconds, and
Pelletier and Caventou have seen them begin in 15 seconds.<a id='r2328' /><a href='#f2328' class='c013'><sup>[2328]</sup></a> M.
Bouillaud has recently found that it has no effect when directly applied
to the nerves.<a id='r2329' /><a href='#f2329' class='c013'><sup>[2329]</sup></a> The experiments of Mr. Blake tend to show,
that its action is exerted solely on the nervous system, and that it
has no direct action on the heart, even when directly admitted into
the blood by the jugular vein.<a id='r2330' /><a href='#f2330' class='c013'><sup>[2330]</sup></a> It appears to act peculiarly by irritating
the spinal cord.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dangerous effects have often been occasioned by an accidental
over-dose in ordinary medical practice. These are well exemplified
by a case communicated to Dr. Bardsley by Dr. Booth of Birmingham.
A man of 46, affected with hemiplegia for nearly four weeks,
began to use strychnia, and had been affected by it for eleven days
without particular inconvenience. During this period he took twice
a day gradually increasing doses, till the amount of one grain was
attained; when the usual physiological effect having ceased to occur,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_685'>685</span>the quantity was increased to a grain and a half. But the first dose
caused anxiety and excitability, in three hours stupor and loss of
speech, and at length violent tetanic convulsions, which proved fatal
in three hours and three-quarters.<a id='r2331' /><a href='#f2331' class='c013'><sup>[2331]</sup></a> A fatal case, occasioned by the
large dose of two scruples, has been recorded by a German physician,
Dr. Blumhardt. In fifteen minutes, imperfect vomiting was
brought on by emetics. At this time, the patient, a lad of seventeen,
lay on his back, quite stiff, and with incipient fits of locked-jaw.
The spasms gradually extended to the rest of the body, till at
last violent fits of general tetanus were established, under which the
whole body became as stiff as a board, the arms spasmodically crossed
over the chest, the legs extended, the feet bent, so that the soles
were concave, the breathing arrested, the eyeballs prominent, the
pupils dilated and not contractile, and the pulse hurried and irregular.
In the second severe fit he died, one hour and a half after
taking the poison.<a id='r2332' /><a href='#f2332' class='c013'><sup>[2332]</sup></a> I have known very dangerous tetanic spasm
induced by so small a dose as two-thirds of a grain of the ordinary
impure strychnia of the shops; and Dr. Pereira describes a case,
communicated by a friend, where death was occasioned by a dose of
half a grain administered three times a day.<a id='r2333' /><a href='#f2333' class='c013'><sup>[2333]</sup></a> As each fit of spasm
went off, respiration, which was found to have ceased, was maintained
artificially; but no sooner did natural breathing return, than
the paroxysm of tetanus returned also; and at length artificial inflation
of the lungs failed to restore life.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only accounts I have seen of the morbid appearances after
death from strychnia are in the cases of Dr. Booth and Dr. Blumhardt.
In the former, the muscles were in a rigid state, the fingers contracted,
the vessels of the brain gorged, the membranes of the spinal cord
highly injected; and four patches of extravasated blood were found
between the spinal arachnoid and the external membrane. In the
latter, twenty-four hours after death, there was general lividity of
the skin, and extraordinary rigidity of the muscles. Fluid blood
flowed in abundance from the spinal cavity, where the veins were
gorged, the pia mater injected, the spinal column softened at its
upper part, and here and there almost pulpy. There was also congestion
and softening of the brain. The head and great vessels were
flaccid, and contained scarcely any blood. The inner membrane of
the stomach and intestines presented some redness, but not more
than is often seen independently of irritation there.</p>

<p class='c006'>Strychnia has been found by Pelletier and Caventou in four species
of <i>Strychnos</i>, the <i>S. nux vomica</i>, <i>Sancti Ignatii</i>, <i>Colubrina</i>, and
<i>Tieuté</i>; and from the researches of MM. Martius and Herberger on
the composition and properties of the American poison Wourali, it is
also probably contained in the <i>S. guianensis</i>.<a id='r2334' /><a href='#f2334' class='c013'><sup>[2334]</sup></a> Vauquelin could not
find it in the <i>S. pseudo-kina</i>, which is destitute of bitterness.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_686'>686</span>
  <h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Nux Vomica.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'><i>Tests of Nux Vomica.</i>—Nux vomica, the most common of these
poisons, is a flat, roundish seed, hardly an inch in diameter, of a
yellowish or greenish-brown colour, covered with short silky hair,
and presenting a little prominence on the middle of one of its surfaces.
In powder it has a dirty greenish-gray colour, an intensely
bitter taste, and an odour like powder of liquorice. It inflames on
burning charcoal, and when treated with nitric acid acquires an
orange-red colour, which is destroyed by the addition of protochloride
of tin. Its infusion also is turned orange-red by nitric acid, and
precipitated grayish-white with tincture of galls.</p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila and Barruel have made some experiments on the mode of
detecting it in the stomach, and the following is the plan recommended
by them. The contents of the stomach, or the powder, if
it can be separated, must be boiled in water acidulated with sulphuric
acid. The liquid after filtration is neutralized with carbonate
of lime, and then evaporated to dryness. The dry mass is then
acted on with successive portions of alcohol, and evaporated to the
consistence of a thin syrup. The product has an intensely bitter
taste, yields a precipitate with ammonia, becomes deep orange-red
with nitric acid, and will sometimes deposit crystals of strychnia on
standing two or three days.<a id='r2335' /><a href='#f2335' class='c013'><sup>[2335]</sup></a> By this process Dr. R. D. Thomson,
in a case which proved fatal in three hours, detected nux-vomica,
although vomiting had been induced by emetics.<a id='r2336' /><a href='#f2336' class='c013'><sup>[2336]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>These experiments it is important to remember, because, contrary
to what takes place in regard to vegetable poisons generally, nux
vomica is often found in the stomachs of those poisoned with it.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Its Mode of Action and Symptoms in Man.</i>—The poisonous properties
of nux vomica are now well known to the vulgar; and in
consequence it is occasionally made the instrument of voluntary
death, although no poison causes such torture. It is difficult to conceive,
considering its intensely bitter taste, how any one could make
it the instrument of murder. But a fact is stated in Rust’s Journal,
which shows that it may be used for that purpose. At a drinking
party one man wagered with another, that if he took a little <i>Cocculus
indicus</i> in beer, he would be compelled to walk home on his head.
The wager was taken and the potion drunk; but nux vomica was
substituted for the Cocculus indicus, itself too a virulent poison;
and the man went home and died in convulsions fifteen minutes
afterwards.<a id='r2337' /><a href='#f2337' class='c013'><sup>[2337]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Many experiments have been made on animals with nux vomica;
but the first accurate inquiry was that of Magendie and Delille read
before the French Institute in 1809. The symptoms they remarked
were precisely the same with those produced by strychnia. Half a
drachm of the powder killed a dog in forty-five minutes, and a grain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_687'>687</span>and a half of the alcoholic extract thrust into a wound killed another
in seven minutes. The animals uniformly experienced dreadful fits
of tetanic spasm, with intervals of relaxation and sensibility, and
were carried off during a paroxysm.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cause of death appears to be prolonged spasm of the thoracic
muscles of respiration. The spasm of these muscles is apparent in
the unavailing efforts which the animals make to inspire. The external
muscles of the chest may be felt during the fits as hard almost
as bone; and, according to an experiment of Wepfer, the diaphragm
partakes in the spasm of the external muscles.<a id='r2338' /><a href='#f2338' class='c013'><sup>[2338]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>On account of the singular symptoms of irritation of the spinal
cord, uncombined with any injury of the brain, this poison is believed
to act on the spinal marrow alone. This is farther shown by
the experiments of Mr. Blake with strychnia alluded to above. But
from some experiments by Segalas it appears also to exhaust the
irritability of the heart: for in animals he found that organ could not
be stimulated to contract after death, and life could not be prolonged
by artificial breathing.<a id='r2339' /><a href='#f2339' class='c013'><sup>[2339]</sup></a> A similar observation was made long ago
by Wepfer, who found the heart motionless and distended with arterial
blood in its left cavities;<a id='r2340' /><a href='#f2340' class='c013'><sup>[2340]</sup></a> and a case of poisoning in the human
subject to the same effect will be presently related. The pulse is
always very weak, often wholly suppressed during a paroxysm; and
in the case alluded to it was found on dissection pale, flaccid and
empty, having been apparently affected with spasm. The action
exerted through the medium of the spinal cord on the muscles is
wholly independent of the brain; for Stannius found that in frogs
the removal of the brain does not interfere with the effects.<a id='r2341' /><a href='#f2341' class='c013'><sup>[2341]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Of late poisoning with nux vomica has been common. The most
characteristic example yet published is a case related by Mr. Ollier,
of a young woman, who in a fit of melancholy, took between two and
three drachms of the powder in water. When the surgeon first saw
her, half an hour afterwards, she was quite well. But going away
in search of an emetic, and returning in ten minutes, he found her in
a state of great alarm, with the limbs extended and separated, and
the pulse faint and quick. She then had a slight and transient convulsion
succeeded by much agitation and anxiety. In a few minutes
she had another, and not long afterwards a third, each about two
minutes in duration. During these fits, “the whole body was stiffened
and straightened, the legs pushed out and forced wide apart;
no pulse or breathing could be perceived; the face and hands were
livid, and the muscles of the former violently convulsed.” In the
short intervals between the fits she was quite sensible, had a feeble
rapid pulse, complained of sickness with great thirst, and perspired
freely. “A fourth and most violent fit soon succeeded, in which the
whole body was extended to the utmost from head to foot. From
<span class='pageno' id='Page_688'>688</span>this she never recovered: she seemed to fall into a state of asphyxia,
relaxed her grasp, and dropped her hands on her knees. Her brows,
however, remained contracted, her lips drawn apart, salivary foam
issued from the corners of the mouth, and the expression of the countenance
was altogether most horrific.” She died an hour after swallowing
the poison.<a id='r2342' /><a href='#f2342' class='c013'><sup>[2342]</sup></a>—A case precisely similar, produced by three
pence worth of the powder, and fatal in little more than an hour, is
related by Mr. Watt of Glasgow.<a id='r2343' /><a href='#f2343' class='c013'><sup>[2343]</sup></a>—Another apparently also similar
but fatal in three hours, is related by Dr. R. D. Thomson.<a id='r2344' /><a href='#f2344' class='c013'><sup>[2344]</sup></a> There
is in fact very little variety of symptoms in different cases, where
death occurs in the primary stage.—Occasionally even in such rapid
cases there is a little vomiting in the first instance. This was remarked
in Mr. Watt’s case, and also in another described by MM.
Orfila and Ollivier.<a id='r2345' /><a href='#f2345' class='c013'><sup>[2345]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>When death does not take place thus suddenly in a fit of spasm,
the person continues to be affected for twelve or sixteen hours with
similar, but milder paroxysms; and afterwards he may either recover
without farther symptoms, or expire in a short time apparently from
exhaustion, or suffer an attack of inflammation of the stomach and
intestines, which may or may not prove fatal.</p>

<p class='c006'>M. Jules Cloquet has described a case, where the patient seemed
to die of the excessive exhaustion produced by the violent, long
continued spasms. The tetanic fits lasted about twenty-four hours,
the sensibility in the intervals being acute. Slight signs of irritation
in the stomach succeeded; and death ensued on the fourth
morning.<a id='r2346' /><a href='#f2346' class='c013'><sup>[2346]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In the Bulletins of the Medical Society of Emulation another case
is related, which arose from an over-dose of the alcoholic extract
being taken by an old woman who was using it for palsy. She took
three grains at once. Violent tetanus was soon produced; and
afterwards she had a regular attack of inflammation of the stomach
and intestines, which proved fatal in three days.</p>

<p class='c006'>The last instance to be noticed exemplifies very well the effects of
the poison when the quantity is insufficient to cause death. A young
woman swallowed purposely a drachm mixed in a glass of wine. In
fifteen minutes she was seized with pain and heat in the stomach,
burning in the gullet, a sense of rending and weariness in the limbs
succeeded by stiffness of the joints, convulsive tremors, tottering in
her gait, and at length violent and frequent fits of tetanus. Milk given
after the tetanus began excited vomiting. She was farther affected with
redness of the gums, inflammation of the tongue, burning thirst, and
pain in the stomach. The pulse also became quick, and the skin hot.
Next day, though the fits had ceased, the muscles were very sore, especially
on motion. The tongue and palate were inflamed, and there
was thirst, pain in the stomach, vomiting, colic and diarrhœa. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_689'>689</span>symptoms, however, abated, and on the fourth day disappeared,
leaving her exceedingly weak.<a id='r2347' /><a href='#f2347' class='c013'><sup>[2347]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>This and the previous case show clearly the double narcotico-acrid
properties of the poison.</p>

<p class='c006'>With regard to the dose requisite to prove fatal, the smallest fatal
dose of the alcoholic extract yet recorded is three grains, which was
the quantity taken in the case from the Parisian bulletins: Hoffmann
mentions a fatal case caused by two fifteen grain doses of the powder;<a id='r2348' /><a href='#f2348' class='c013'><sup>[2348]</sup></a>
and in Hufeland’s Journal there is another caused by two drachms,
which was fatal in two hours.<a id='r2349' /><a href='#f2349' class='c013'><sup>[2349]</sup></a>—A dog has been killed by eight
grains of the powder, and a cat by five.<a id='r2350' /><a href='#f2350' class='c013'><sup>[2350]</sup></a> It is even said that a dog
has been killed by two grains.<a id='r2351' /><a href='#f2351' class='c013'><sup>[2351]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It has been thought, from some observations by Mr. Baker on the
medicinal use of nux vomica in Hindostan that, by the force of habit,
the constitution may become to a certain extent accustomed to large
doses of this poison, in the same manner as it acquires the power of
enduring large doses of opium. The natives of Hindostan, often
take it morning and evening for many months continuously, beginning
with an eighth part of a nut, and gradually increasing the
dose to an entire nut, or about twenty grains. If it is taken either
immediately before or after meals, it never occasions any unpleasant
effects; but if this precaution be neglected, spasms are apt to ensue.<a id='r2352' /><a href='#f2352' class='c013'><sup>[2352]</sup></a>
As it is found unsafe, however, to increase the dose beyond one nut,
and the poison is taken in the form of coarse powder, in which state
it must be slowly acted on by the fluid in the stomach, it is probable
that the modifying influence of habit is inconsiderable. Habit certainly
does not familiarize the system to strychnia used medicinally.
The same dose, which has once excited its peculiar physiological
action, will for the most part suffice to excite it again, however frequently
the dose may be repeated.—The facts mentioned by Mr.
Baker show that nux vomica is not a cumulative poison; and European
experience, in the instance of strychnia, is to the same effect.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Morbid Appearances.</i>—The morbid appearances differ according
to the period at which death occurs. In Mr. Ollier’s case, where
death took place in an hour, the appearances were insignificant.
The stomach was almost natural, the vessels of the brain somewhat
congested, the heart flaccid, empty, and pale. In the case in Hufeland’s
Journal there was general inflammation of the stomach, duodenum
and part of the jejunum. In Cloquet’s case, a slower one,
there was very little appearance of inflammation. In that from the
Parisian bulletins, on the contrary, the stomach was highly inflamed,
the intestines violet-coloured, in many places easily lacerated and
apparently gangrenous. In an interesting dissection of a case, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_690'>690</span>was quickly fatal,—that related by Orfila and Ollivier, there was
found much serous effusion on the surface of the cerebellum, and
softening of the whole cortical substance of the brain, but especially
of the cerebellum. Blumhardt too, found softening of the cerebellum
and congestion of the cerebral vessels, together with softening of the
spinal cord and general gorging of the spinal veins. This is some
confirmation of an opinion advanced not long ago in France by
Flourence and others, that nux vomica acts particularly on the cerebellum.<a id='r2353' /><a href='#f2353' class='c013'><sup>[2353]</sup></a>
In Dr. R. D. Thomson’s case, which was examined by
Mr. Taylor, there was found much congestion of the whole membranes
and substance of the brain and cerebellum, and even some
extravasation of blood within the cavity of the arachnoid over the
upper surface of the former. Mr. Watt remarked in his case (sixty
hours, however, after death in summer) softening of the substance of
the brain and the lumbar part of the spinal cord.—In Orfila and
Ollivier’s case the lungs were found much gorged with black fluid
blood.—In Blumhardt’s case the heart and great vessels were entirely
destitute of blood.—There is sometimes seen, as in Dr. R. D.
Thomson’s case, a brown powder lining the stomach, even although
vomiting may have occurred.</p>

<p class='c006'>The body appears sometimes to retain for a certain period after
death the attitude and expression impressed on it by the convulsions
during life. In the instance mentioned by Orfila and Ollivier the
muscles immediately after death remained contracted, the head bent
back, the arms bent, and the jaws locked. This state may even
continue for some hours, so that the body appears to pass into the
state of rigidity which precedes decay, without also passing through
the preliminary stage of flaccidity immediately after death. In the
case related by Mr. Ollier, the body five hours after death “was
still as stiff and straight as a statue, so that if one of the hands was
moved the whole body moved along with it;” and in Blumhardt’s
case the rigidity twenty hours after death was unusually great. This
state of rigidity, however, does not invariably occur. On the contrary,
in animals the limbs become very flaccid immediately after
death; but the usual rigidity supervenes at an early period.<a id='r2354' /><a href='#f2354' class='c013'><sup>[2354]</sup></a> In Dr.
R. D. Thomson’s case flaccidity immediately followed death.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Treatment.</i>—Little is known of the treatment in this kind of poisoning.
But it is of the greatest moment to evacuate the stomach
thoroughly, and without loss of time. Hence emetics are useful;
but if the stomach-pump is at hand it ought to be resorted to without
waiting for the operation of emetics. Torosiewicz describes the
case of a young woman who, after the usual symptoms had begun to
appear in consequence of the administration of a tea-spoonful of powder,
recovered under the action of an emetic followed by rhatany-root.<a id='r2355' /><a href='#f2355' class='c013'><sup>[2355]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_691'>691</span>When nux vomica is taken in powder,—the most frequent
form in which it has been used,—it adheres with great obstinacy to
the inside of the stomach. Consequently whatever means are employed
for evacuating the stomach, they must be continued assiduously
for a considerable time. If the patient is not attacked with
spasms in two hours, he will generally be safe.</p>

<p class='c006'>M. Donné of Paris has stated that he has found iodine, bromine,
and chlorine to be antidotes for poisoning with the alkaloid of nux
vomica, as well as for the other vegetable alkaloids. Iodine, chlorine,
and bromine, he says, form with the alkaloid compounds which
are not deleterious,—two grains and a half of the iodide, bromide,
and chloride of strychnia, having produced no effect on a dog. Animals
which had taken one grain of strychnia or two grains of veratria,
did not sustain any harm, when tincture of iodine was administered immediately
afterwards. But the delay of ten minutes in the administration
of the antidote rendered it useless. In the compounds formed by
these antidotes with the alkaloids, the latter are in a state of chemical
union, and not decomposed. Sulphuric acid separates strychnia,
for example, from its state of combination with chlorine, iodine, or
bromine, and forms sulphate of strychnia, with its usual poisonous
qualities.<a id='r2356' /><a href='#f2356' class='c013'><sup>[2356]</sup></a> It remains to be proved that the same advantages will
be derived from the administration of these antidotes in the instance
of poisoning with the crude drug, nux vomica, as in poisoning with
its alkaloid.</p>

<p class='c006'>In general little difficulty will be encountered in recognizing a case
of poisoning with nux vomica. <i>Tetanus</i> or locked-jaw is the only
disease which produces similar effects. But that disease never proves
so quickly fatal as the rapid cases of poisoning with nux vomica;
and it never produces the symptoms of irritation observed in the
slower cases. Besides, the fits of natural tetanus are almost always
slow in being formed; while nux vomica brings on perfect fits in an
hour or less. It is right to remember, however, that nux vomica
may be given in small doses, frequently repeated, and gradually
increased, so as to imitate exactly the phenomena of tetanus from
natural causes. Medical men will be at no loss to discover, on reflection,
how the preparations of this drug may be rendered formidable
secret poisons.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with the St. Ignatius Bean and Upas Tieuté.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The <i>Strychnos Sancti Ignatii</i>, or St. Ignatius bean, contains about
three times as much strychnia as nux vomica, namely, from twelve
to eighteen parts in the 1000. It is very energetic. Dr. Hopf has
mentioned an instance of a man, who was attacked with tetanus of
several hours’ duration after taking the powder of half a bean in
brandy, and who seems to have made a narrow escape.<a id='r2357' /><a href='#f2357' class='c013'><sup>[2357]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_692'>692</span>The <i>Strychnos tieuté</i> is the plant which yields the Upas tieuté,
one of the Javanese poisons. This substance has been analyzed by
Pelletier and Caventou, and found to contain strychnia.<a id='r2358' /><a href='#f2358' class='c013'><sup>[2358]</sup></a> From the
experiments of Magendie and Delille, the Upas tieuté appears to be
almost as energetic as strychnia itself.<a id='r2359' /><a href='#f2359' class='c013'><sup>[2359]</sup></a> Mayer found that the bark
of the plant which yields it, when applied in the dose of fifty grains
to a wound, killed a rabbit in two hours and a half.<a id='r2360' /><a href='#f2360' class='c013'><sup>[2360]</sup></a> Dr. Darwin
has given an account of its effects on the Javanese criminals, who
used formerly to be executed by darts poisoned with the tieuté. The
account quoted by him is not very authentic; yet it accords precisely
with what would be expected from the known properties of the poison.
He says, that a few minutes after the criminals are wounded
with the instrument of the executioner, they tremble violently, utter
piercing cries, and perish amidst frightful convulsions in ten or fifteen
minutes.<a id='r2361' /><a href='#f2361' class='c013'><sup>[2361]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with False Angustura Bark.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Besides these poisons of the genus Strychnos, the present group
comprehends another, of the same properties, which was once supposed
to be derived from a plant of a different family, the <i>Brucea
antidysenterica</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>A species of bark, commonly called the false angustura bark, was
introduced by mistake into Europe instead of the true angustura,
cusparia, or bark of the <i>Galipea officinalis</i>. It was long supposed
to be the bark of the <i>Brucea antidysenterica</i>; but it is now known
to be the bark of <i>S. nux vomica</i>.<a id='r2362' /><a href='#f2362' class='c013'><sup>[2362]</sup></a> It is a poison of great energy.
It gave rise to so many fatal accidents soon after its introduction,
that in some countries on the continent all the stores of angustura
were ordered to be burnt. It contains a less proportion of strychnia,
but more of the alkaloid brucia than nux vomica, the seed of
the plant.</p>

<p class='c006'>According to Andral, brucia is twenty-four times less powerful
than strychnia;<a id='r2363' /><a href='#f2363' class='c013'><sup>[2363]</sup></a> but the bark itself is as strong nearly as nux-vomica,
for Orfila found that eight grains killed a dog in less than two
hours.<a id='r2364' /><a href='#f2364' class='c013'><sup>[2364]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The symptoms it induces are the same as those caused by nux
vomica. They are minutely detailed in a paper by Professor Emmert
of Bern.<a id='r2365' /><a href='#f2365' class='c013'><sup>[2365]</sup></a> It appears that during the intervals of the fits the
sensibility is remarkably acute: a boy who fell a victim to it implored
his physician not to touch him, as he was immediately thrown into a
fit. Professor Marc of Paris was once violently affected by this poison,
which he took by mistake for the true angustura to cure ague.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_693'>693</span>He took it in the form of infusion, and the dose was only three-quarters
of a liqueur-glassful; yet he was seized with nausea, pain in
the stomach, a sense of fulness in the head, giddiness, ringing in the
ears, and obscurity of vision, followed by stiffness of the limbs, great
pain on every attempt at motion, locked-jaw, and impossibility of
articulating. These symptoms continued two hours; and abated
under the use of ether and laudanum.<a id='r2366' /><a href='#f2366' class='c013'><sup>[2366]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Some interesting experiments were made by Emmert with this
poison to show that it acts on the spine directly, and not on that organ
through the medium of the brain. If an animal be poisoned by
inserting the extract of false angustura bark into its hind-legs after
the spinal cord has been severed at the loins, the hind-legs as well
as the fore-legs are thrown into a state of spasm; or if the medulla
oblongata be cut across and respiration maintained artificially, the
usual symptoms are produced over the whole body by the administration
of it internally or externally,—the only material difference
being that they commence more slowly, and that a larger dose is required
to produce them, than when the medulla is not injured. On
the other hand, when the spinal cord is suddenly destroyed after
the symptoms have begun, they cease instantaneously, although the
circulation goes on for some minutes.<a id='r2367' /><a href='#f2367' class='c013'><sup>[2367]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The true angustura bark has a finer texture than the other, and is
darker coloured, aromatic, pungent, and less bitter. The ferro-cyanate
of potass causes in a muriatic infusion of the false bark a precipitate,
which is first green and then becomes blue; and the same
reagent converts into blue the reddish powder which lines the bark.
No such effects are produced on the true angustura bark. Nitric
acid renders the rusty efflorescence of the spurious bark deep dirty
blue, but has no such effect on the true bark; which, besides, never
exhibits a yellow efflorescence.</p>

<p class='c006'>With the preceding poisons Orfila has arranged also some
poisons used by the American Indians; but, as in Europe they are
mere objects of curiosity, it is scarcely necessary to treat of them
particularly here.</p>

<p class='c006'>The most interesting and best known of them is the <i>wourali poison</i>
of Guiana, variously called woorara, urari, or curare, by
different authors. It is believed to have been traced by Martius
to a new species of strychnos, the <i>S. guianensis</i>, and more recently
by Dr. Schomburg to a different species, the <i>S. toxicaria</i>
of that traveller. But the action it exerts does not correspond
exactly with what would be expected of a plant belonging to that
genus.</p>

<p class='c006'>The effects of wourali have been investigated by Sir B. Brodie
in the Philosophical Transactions for 1811–12, in Orfila’s Toxicology,
in Magendie’s Memoir on Absorption, and in Fontana’s Traité des
Poisons. But the most detailed inquiry is that by Emmert, published
in 1818. It produces, not convulsions or spasm of the muscles,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_694'>694</span>but on the contrary paralysis, and probably occasions death in
this way by suspending the respiration, in the same way as hemlock
and conia. According to Emmert’s experiments the spine only is
acted on, and not the brain also.<a id='r2368' /><a href='#f2368' class='c013'><sup>[2368]</sup></a> Some remarkable experiments
were made in 1839 by Mr. Waterton, to show the power of artificial
respiration in accomplishing recovery from its effects. After the
animals had fallen down motionless from the action of the poison
introduced through a wound, and when the action of the heart had
become so feeble as not to affect the pulse, artificial respiration,
continued in one instance for seven hours and a half, and in another
for two hours, had the effect of restoring the animals to health.<a id='r2369' /><a href='#f2369' class='c013'><sup>[2369]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br /> <span class='small'>OF POISONING WITH CAMPHOR, COCCULUS INDICUS, ETC.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>The third group of the narcotico-acrids resemble strychnia in their
action so far, that they occasion in large doses convulsions of the
tetanic kind. But they differ considerably by producing at the same
time impaired sensibility or sopor. They are camphor, Cocculus
indicus, its active principle picrotoxin, the Coriara myrtifolia, the
Upas antiar, a Java poison, and perhaps also the yew-tree.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Camphor.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Camphor dissolved in oil soon causes in dogs paroxysms of tetanic
spasm. At first the senses are entire in the intervals; but by degrees
they become duller, till at length a state of deep sopor is established,
with noisy laborious breathing, and expiration of camphorous
fumes; and in this state the animal soon perishes. A solution
of twenty grains in olive oil will kill a dog in less than ten
minutes when injected into the jugular vein. When camphor is
given to dogs in fragments, it does not excite convulsions, but
kills them more slowly by inducing inflammation of the alimentary
canal. These are the results of numerous experiments by Orfila.<a id='r2370' /><a href='#f2370' class='c013'><sup>[2370]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>They are confirmed by others performed more lately by Scudery
of Messina; but this experimentalist likewise remarked, that the
convulsions were attended with a singular kind of delirium, which
made the animals run up and down without apparent cause, as if
they were maniacal. He also found the urinary organs generally
affected, and for the most part with strangury.<a id='r2371' /><a href='#f2371' class='c013'><sup>[2371]</sup></a> Lebküchner discovered
camphor in the blood of animals poisoned with it.<a id='r2372' /><a href='#f2372' class='c013'><sup>[2372]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Symptoms in Man.</i>—The symptoms caused by camphor in man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_695'>695</span>may not have been observed; but so far as they have been witnessed,
they establish its claim to be considered a narcotic and acrid
poison. Its effects appear to be singularly uncertain: at least they
are very discrepant; and the reason for this is not apparent.</p>

<p class='c006'>Its narcotic effects are well exemplified in an account given by
Mr. Alexander from personal experience, and by Dr. Edwards of
Paris, as they occurred in a patient of his who received a camphor
clyster.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Alexander, in the course of his experiments on his own person
with various drugs, was nearly killed by this poison, and has
left the best account yet published of its effects in dangerous doses
on man. After having found, by a previous experiment, that a
scruple did not cause any particular symptom, he swallowed in one
dose two scruples mixed with syrup of roses. In the course of
twenty minutes he became languid and listless, and in an hour giddy,
confused, and forgetful. All objects quivered before his eyes, and a
tumult of undigested ideas floated through his mind. At length he
lost all consciousness, during which he was attacked with strong convulsive
fits and maniacal frenzy. These alarming symptoms were
dispelled, on Dr. Monro, who had been sent for, accidentally discovering
the subject of his patient’s experimental researches, and administering
an emetic. But a variety of singular mental affections
continued for some time after. The emetic brought away almost the
whole camphor which had been swallowed three hours before.<a id='r2373' /><a href='#f2373' class='c013'><sup>[2373]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In Dr. Edwards’s patient, the symptoms were excited by an injection
containing half a drachm of camphor. In a few minutes he
felt a camphrous taste, which was followed by indescribable uneasiness.
On then going down stairs for assistance, he was astonished
to feel his body so light, that he seemed to himself to skim along the
floor almost without touching it. He afterwards began to stagger,
his face became pale, he felt chilly, and was attacked with a sense
of numbness in the scalp. On then taking a glass of wine, which
he asked for, he became gradually better; but for some time his
mind was singularly affected. He felt anxious, without thinking
himself in danger; he shed tears, but could not tell why; they
flowed in fact involuntarily. For twenty-four hours his breath exhaled
a camphrous odour.<a id='r2374' /><a href='#f2374' class='c013'><sup>[2374]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Hoffmann has related a case analogous to those of Alexander and
Edwards. The dose was two scruples taken in oil; the symptoms
vertigo, chilliness, anxiety, delirium, and somnolency.<a id='r2375' /><a href='#f2375' class='c013'><sup>[2375]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>These cases would seem to indicate very considerable activity;
yet there can be little doubt that even larger doses have been at
times taken with much less effect. Thus, from an account given by
Dr. Eickhorn of New Orleans, of its operation on himself, when incautiously
swallowed to the amount of two drachms in frequent
small doses within three hours, it would appear that the only result
was great heat, palpitation, hurried pulse, and pleasant intoxication,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_696'>696</span>then moisture of the skin, next profound sleep for some hours, attended
with excessive sweating, and finally no ultimate ill consequence
except great debility.<a id='r2376' /><a href='#f2376' class='c013'><sup>[2376]</sup></a> I am assured by a correspondent,
Dr. Jennison of Cambridge, U. S., that a medical friend of his has
given 90 grains of camphor four times a day in phrenitis, with safety
and advantage.</p>

<p class='c006'>Professor Wendt of Breslau has related an instance, which proves
the irritant action of camphor on man, and likewise the uncertainty
of the dose required to act deleteriously. In the case of Mr. Alexander,
two scruples would in all probability have proved fatal, had
they not been discharged in time by vomiting. In the case now to
be noticed, 160 grains were taken in a state of solution in alcohol,
and were not vomited; yet the individual recovered. He was a
drunkard, who took four ounces of camphorated spirit, prescribed
for him as an embrocation. Soon afterwards he was attacked with
fever, burning heat of the skin, anxiety, burning pain in the stomach,
giddiness, flushed face, dimness of sight, sparks before the
eyes, and some delirium. He soon got well under the use of almond
oil and vinegar, but did not vomit.<a id='r2377' /><a href='#f2377' class='c013'><sup>[2377]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Morbid Appearances.</i>—The morbid appearances caused by camphor
have not, so far as I know, been witnessed in man. In dogs
examined immediately after death, the heart is no longer contractile,
and its left cavities contain arterial blood of a reddish-brown colour.
When the poison has been given in fragments, it leaves marks of inflammation
in the stomach and intestines. Orfila found these organs
much inflamed in such circumstances.<a id='r2378' /><a href='#f2378' class='c013'><sup>[2378]</sup></a> Scudery found the membranes
of the brain much injected, and the brain itself sometimes softened;
the inner membrane of the stomach either very red, or checkered
with black, gangrenous-like spots of the size of millet-seeds; the
duodenum in the same state; the ureters, urethra, and spermatic
cords inflamed; and every organ in the body, even the brain, impregnated
with the odour of camphor.<a id='r2379' /><a href='#f2379' class='c013'><sup>[2379]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Cocculus Indicus.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The <i>Menispermum cocculus</i>, <i>Cocculus suberosus</i>, or <i>Anamirta cocculus</i>
of botanists, is a creeping plant which grows in the island of Ceylon,
on the Malabar coast, and in other parts of the East Indies. Its
fruit, which is the only part of the plant hitherto particularly examined,
is like a large, rough, grayish-black pea, and is known in the
shops by the name of Cocculus indicus. It has a rough, ligneous
pericarp, enclosing a pale grayish-yellow, brittle kernel, of a very
strong lasting bitter taste. The medical jurist should make himself
well acquainted with its external characters, because, besides being
occasionally used in medicine, it is a familiar poison for destroying
fish, and has also been extensively used by brewers as a substitute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_697'>697</span>for hops,—an adulteration which is prohibited in Britain by severe
statutes. It has been analyzed by M. Boullay of Paris,<a id='r2380' /><a href='#f2380' class='c013'><sup>[2380]</sup></a> who found
in it besides other matters, a peculiar principle termed picrotoxin.
This principle constitutes, according to Boullay, about a fifth part of
the kernel; according to Nees von Esenbeck, only a hundreth part:<a id='r2381' /><a href='#f2381' class='c013'><sup>[2381]</sup></a>
and my own experiments agree with the results of the latter. It is
moderately soluble in water, and crystallizes readily from a hot acidulous
watery solution. It is more soluble in hot alcohol, from which
it crystallizes in granular masses. Ten grains of it killed a dog in
twenty-five minutes in the second paroxysm of tetanus.</p>

<p class='c006'>The seeds themselves occasion vomiting soon after they are swallowed;
so that animals may often swallow them, if not without injury, at all
events without danger. But if the gullet be tied, the animal soon begins
to stagger; the eye acquires a peculiar haggard expression, which is the
sure forerunner of a tetanic paroxysm; and the second, third, or fourth
fit commonly proves fatal. Three or four drachms will kill a dog
when introduced into the stomach; less will suffice when it is applied
to a wound; and still less when it is injected into a vein.<a id='r2382' /><a href='#f2382' class='c013'><sup>[2382]</sup></a> Wepfer
has related a good experiment, from which he infers that Cocculus
indicus acts by exhausting the irritability of the heart. In the intervals
of the fits the pulse could not be felt; and on opening the
chest immediately after death, he found the heart motionless and
all its cavities distended.<a id='r2383' /><a href='#f2383' class='c013'><sup>[2383]</sup></a> Orfila also sometimes found the heart
motionless, and its left cavities filled with reddish-brown blood.<a id='r2384' /><a href='#f2384' class='c013'><sup>[2384]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>This poison does not seem to possess distinct acrid properties in
regard to animals. M. Goupil indeed found that it produced vomiting
and purging,<a id='r2385' /><a href='#f2385' class='c013'><sup>[2385]</sup></a> but Orfila could not observe any such effect. According
to Goupil it possesses the singular property of communicating
to the flesh of animals, more particularly of fish, that have been
killed with it, some of the poisonous qualities with which it is itself
endowed. The accuracy of this statement may be doubted, the
alleged fact being contrary to analogy. Besides, this poison has
been used immemorially in the East for taking fish; and it is familiarly
used for the same purpose in some parts of France, though prohibited
by statute. Chevallier mentions that in a particular parish
the inhabitants live half the year on fish caught with this poison;
and that a friend of his made trial of fish so caught, without the
slightest injury.<a id='r2386' /><a href='#f2386' class='c013'><sup>[2386]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Symptoms in Man.</i>—Although it is well known that malt liquors
have often been adulterated with Cocculus indicus for the purpose of
economizing hops, cases of poisoning in the human subject are rare,
because the quantity required to communicate the due degree of bitterness
is small. Professor Bernt has shortly noticed a set of cases,
which arose in consequence of an idiot having seasoned soup with it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_698'>698</span>by mistake. Nine people were taken ill with sickness, vomiting,
pain in the stomach and bowels; and one died in twelve days.<a id='r2387' /><a href='#f2387' class='c013'><sup>[2387]</sup></a> The
symptoms under which this person died are not stated; but the account
of the accident sent to Bernt imputed death to the poison,—which
is improbable, considering the length of the interval before
death.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the same group with camphor and Cocculus indicus Orfila has
arranged <i>Upas antiar</i>, a Javanese poison. This poison is a very bitter
milky juice or extract, which is known in Europe only as an article
of curiosity. It has been sometimes confounded with the Upas
tieuté. It owes its properties to a neutral principle called antiarin.<a id='r2388' /><a href='#f2388' class='c013'><sup>[2388]</sup></a>
From the experiments of MM. Magendie and Delille,<a id='r2389' /><a href='#f2389' class='c013'><sup>[2389]</sup></a> as well as
from those of Sir B. Brodie<a id='r2390' /><a href='#f2390' class='c013'><sup>[2390]</sup></a> and of Emmert<a id='r2391' /><a href='#f2391' class='c013'><sup>[2391]</sup></a> it appears to act in the
same manner, and to produce the same effects, as camphor and
Cocculus indicus. In small doses it acts as an irritant; in large
doses it causes convulsions and coma.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is here noticed principally because it is one of the poisons which
act violently on the heart. If the body of an animal be examined
immediately after death from the Upas antiar, the heart is found to
have lost its irritability, and the left ventricle to contain florid blood:
Schnell found, that, like many other active poisons, it has no effect
when applied to the divided end of a nerve.<a id='r2392' /><a href='#f2392' class='c013'><sup>[2392]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>Coriaria myrtifolia</i> is also supposed by some to possess the
properties of the present group, and is sufficiently important from
its energy, and its occasional injurious effects on man, to claim some
notice here.</p>

<p class='c006'>Its toxicological action has been investigated by Professor Mayer
of Bonn, who found that it excites in most animals violent fits of
tetanus, giving place to apoplectic coma; and that in the dead body
the brain is seen gorged with blood, the blood in the heart and great
vessels fluid, the heart not irritable immediately after death, and the
inner membrane of the stomach yellowish and shrivelled. A drachm
of the extract of the juice killed a cat in two hours when swallowed;
half a drachm applied to a wound killed another in eighty-five
minutes; and six grains in the same way killed a kitten in three
hours and a half. A drachm swallowed by a young dog killed it in
two hours and a half. Ten grains of the extract of the infusion applied
to a wound killed a kitten in six hours; and three grains another
in three hours. A buzzard was killed in three-quarters of an hour
by half a drachm of the extract of the juice. Frogs are also soon
killed by it. Rabbits, it is remarkable, are scarcely affected by this
poison, either administered internally, or applied to a wound,—a
drachm in the former way, and half as much in the latter, having
produced no effect at all. A grain, however, injected into the jugular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_699'>699</span>vein occasioned in about five hours a single convulsive paroxysm,
which proved immediately fatal.<a id='r2393' /><a href='#f2393' class='c013'><sup>[2393]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Instances of poisoning with this substance have occurred in the
human subject,—generally in consequence of its having been taken
in various parts of the continent with senna, which it is employed to
adulterate. Sauvages has recorded two cases of death occasioned by
the berries. In one, a child, death took place within a day under
symptoms like epileptic convulsions; and in the other, an adult, who
swallowed only fifteen berries, convulsions, coma, and lividity of the
face were produced, ending fatally the same evening, though the
greater part of the berries were discharged by emetics.<a id='r2394' /><a href='#f2394' class='c013'><sup>[2394]</sup></a> In recent
French journals various similar cases are recorded. M. Fée describes
five cases, one of them fatal. In this instance, a male adult, death
occurred within four hours after he took an infusion of senna adulterated
with the coriaria; and the symptoms were violent convulsions,
locked-jaw and colic.<a id='r2395' /><a href='#f2395' class='c013'><sup>[2395]</sup></a> M. Roux has noticed a great number of
cases in the fullest paper yet published on its effects on man, and
gives the details of three which came under his own notice, and of
which one proved fatal. In the fatal case, that of a child three years
and a half old, who took between eighty and a hundred berries, the
symptoms were heat and pricking of the tongue, sparking and rolling
of the eyes, loss of voice, locked-jaw, and convulsions recurring in
occasional fits of eight or ten minutes in duration. Death ensued in
sixteen hours and a half.<a id='r2396' /><a href='#f2396' class='c013'><sup>[2396]</sup></a> Roux refers also among other instances
to those of no fewer than ten soldiers, who were attacked at the same
time in consequence of eating the berries, and of whom two died.
In Roux’s fatal case there was injection of the membranes of the
brain, and no other particular appearance; in that mentioned by
Fée, there was inflammation of the stomach and bowels; and in one
of Sauvages’s cases no morbid appearance at all was discovered.</p>

<p class='c006'>Considering these very pointed proofs of the poisonous qualities
of the coriaria, it is not a little singular that doubts have lately
arisen whether it is a poison at all. Peschier of Geneva says he has
ascertained that tanners, who use it in their trade on account of the
powerful astringency of the leaves, also take it internally for gleet,
and that he gave a decoction of an ounce to chickens, dogs, and
men, without witnessing any ill effect.<a id='r2397' /><a href='#f2397' class='c013'><sup>[2397]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Yew.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The leaves and berries of the <i>Taxus baccata</i>, or yew, are known
to be poisonous; but their effects have not been investigated with
care. I have arranged it in the meantime with the present group.</p>

<p class='c006'>M. Grognier, as quoted by Orfila, ascertained that a decoction of
eight ounces of berries without seeds had no effect on a dog; that a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_700'>700</span>pound and a half of seeds had no effect on a horse; that three
ounces of the juice of the leaves given to a large dog merely caused
vomiting; and that a decoction of twelve ounces of leaves, confined
in the stomach of a dog by a ligature on the gullet, had also no effect.
But two ounces of the juice of the leaves killed a small dog;
and Orfila himself ascertained, that thirty-six grains of extract of the
leaves, injected into the jugular vein, caused giddiness, stupor, and
death.<a id='r2398' /><a href='#f2398' class='c013'><sup>[2398]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Accidents have repeatedly happened to children in this country
from yew-berries. Mr. Hurt of Mansfield has given the particulars
of an interesting case. A child, three years and a half old, two
hours after eating the berries, was observed to look ill at dinner,
and became affected with lividity and heaviness of the eyes, as if he
was about to fall asleep. Vomiting followed, without any pain; and
he died before a medical man, who was sent for, could arrive. Four
other children, somewhat older, who had eaten the seeds, were made
to vomit by emetics, and got well. The dead body of the first child
presented many livid spots, redness of the villous coat of the stomach,
and gorging of the brain and membranes with blood. A mass of
berries, seeds, and potatoes was found in the stomach.<a id='r2399' /><a href='#f2399' class='c013'><sup>[2399]</sup></a>—Dr. Hartmann
of Frankfort mentions that a girl, who took a decoction of the
leaves to produce abortion, died in consequence, but without having
miscarried.<a id='r2400' /><a href='#f2400' class='c013'><sup>[2400]</sup></a>—Dr. Percival has related other cases in his essays.<a id='r2401' /><a href='#f2401' class='c013'><sup>[2401]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXIX.<br /> <span class='small'>OF THE POISONOUS FUNGI.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>A fourth group of poisons possessing narcotico-acrid proper ties, includes
the poisonous <i>fungi</i> or mushrooms.</p>

<p class='c006'>Accidents arising from the deadly fungi being mistaken for eatable
mushrooms are common on the continent, and especially in France.
They are not uncommon, too, in Britain; but they are less frequent
than abroad, because the epicure’s catalogue of mushrooms in this
country contains only three species, whose characters are too distinct
to be mistaken by a person of ordinary skill; while abroad a great
variety of them have found their way to the table, many of which
are not only liable to be confounded with poisonous species, but are
even also themselves of doubtful quality.</p>

<p class='c006'>The present subject cannot be thoroughly studied without a knowledge
of the appearance and characters of all the fungi which have
been ascertained to be esculent, as well as of those which are known
to be deleterious. This information, however, I cannot pretend to
communicate, as it would lead to great details. In what follows,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_701'>701</span>therefore, a simple list will be given of the two classes, with references
to the proper source for minute descriptions of them, and some
general observations on the effects of the poisonous species.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>List of the wholesome and poisonous Fungi.</i>—The only good account
yet published of the innocent or eatable fungi of Great Britain
is contained in an elaborate essay on the subject by Dr. Greville of
this place. He enumerates no fewer than twenty-six different species,
which grow abundantly in our woods and fields, and which,
although most of them utterly neglected in this country, are all considered
abroad to be eatable, and many of them delicate. They are
the following: <i>Tuber cibarium</i>, or common truffle; <i>T. moschatum</i> and
<i>T. album</i>, two species of analogous qualities; <i>Amanita cæsarea</i> or
<i>aurantiaca</i>, the Oronge of the French, a species which is often confounded
by the ignorant with a very poisonous one, the <i>A. muscaria</i>,
or <i>pseudo-aurantiaca</i>; <i>Agaricus procerus</i>; <i>A. campestris</i>, the common
mushroom of meadows; <i>A. edulis</i>, or white caps; <i>A. oreades</i>, or
Scotch bonnets; <i>A. odorus</i>; <i>A. uburneus</i>; <i>A. ulmarius</i>; <i>A. ostreatus</i>;
<i>A. violaceus</i>; <i>A. deliciosus</i>; <i>A. piperatus</i>; and <i>A. acris</i>; <i>Boletus
edulis</i>; and <i>B. scaber</i>; <i>Fistulina hepatica</i>; <i>Hydnum repandum</i>; <i>Morchella
esculenta</i>, the common morelle; <i>Helvella mitra</i>, and <i>H. leucophæa</i>.
Of these the <i>Agaricus acris</i>, <i>procerus</i>, and <i>piperatus</i> are probably
unwholesome; and the <i>Amanita cæsarea</i> is very rare in this
country, if indeed it is indigenous at all. The <i>A. muscaria</i>, with
which it is apt to be confounded, is common enough. The species
to which our cooks confine their attention are the <i>Tuber cibarium</i> or
truffle, the <i>Agaricus campestris</i>, or common mushroom, and the
<i>Morchella esculenta</i>, or morelle. The <i>Agaricus edulis</i> is also to be met
with in some markets, but is not in general use.<a id='r2402' /><a href='#f2402' class='c013'><sup>[2402]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The best description of the poisonous species is to be found in
Orfila’s Toxicology. He enumerates the <i>Amanita muscaria</i>, <i>alba</i>,
<i>citrina</i>, and <i>viridis</i>; the <i>Hypophyllum maculatum</i>, <i>albocitrinum</i>, <i>tricuspidatum</i>,
<i>sanguineum</i>, <i>crux-melitense</i>, <i>pudibundum</i> and <i>pellitum</i>;
the <i>Agaricus necator</i>, <i>acris</i>, <i>piperatus</i>, <i>pyrogalus</i>, <i>stypticus</i>, <i>annularis</i>,
and <i>urens</i>.<a id='r2403' /><a href='#f2403' class='c013'><sup>[2403]</sup></a> To these may be added the <i>Agaricus semiglobatus</i>, on
the authority of Messrs. Brande and Sowerby,<a id='r2404' /><a href='#f2404' class='c013'><sup>[2404]</sup></a> the <i>A. campanulatus</i>,<a id='r2405' /><a href='#f2405' class='c013'><sup>[2405]</sup></a>
the <i>A. procerus</i>, on the authority of a case by Dr. Peddie of this
city,<a id='r2406' /><a href='#f2406' class='c013'><sup>[2406]</sup></a> the <i>A. myomica</i>, on the authority of Ghiglini,<a id='r2407' /><a href='#f2407' class='c013'><sup>[2407]</sup></a> the <i>A. panterinus</i>
on that of Dr. Paolini of Bologna,<a id='r2408' /><a href='#f2408' class='c013'><sup>[2408]</sup></a> the <i>A. bulbosus</i> of Bulliard,
or <i>Amanita venenata</i>, on that of Pouchet,<a id='r2409' /><a href='#f2409' class='c013'><sup>[2409]</sup></a> the <i>Agaricus vernus</i>, <i>insidiosus</i>,
<i>globocephalus</i>, <i>sanguineus</i>, <i>torminosus</i> and <i>rimosus</i>, on that
of Letellier,<a id='r2410' /><a href='#f2410' class='c013'><sup>[2410]</sup></a> and the <i>Hypophyllum niveum</i> on the authority of Paulet.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Circumstances which modify their qualities.</i>—The qualities of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_702'>702</span>fungi as articles of food are liable to considerable variety. Some,
which are in general eaten in safety, occasionally become hurtful; and
some of the poisonous kinds may under certain circumstances become
inert, or even esculent. But the causes which regulate these variations
are not well ascertained.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been thought by some that most fungi become safe when
they have been dried;<a id='r2411' /><a href='#f2411' class='c013'><sup>[2411]</sup></a> and there may be some truth in this remark,
as their poisonous qualities appear to depend in part on a volatile
principle. But it is by no means universally true. Foderé mentions
that the <i>Agaricus piperatus</i> continues acrid after having been dried.<a id='r2412' /><a href='#f2412' class='c013'><sup>[2412]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Climate certainly alters their properties. The <i>Agaricus piperatus</i>
is eaten in Prussia and Russia;<a id='r2413' /><a href='#f2413' class='c013'><sup>[2413]</sup></a> but is poisonous in France. The
<i>Agaricus acris</i> and <i>A. necator</i>, also enumerated above as meriting their
names, are used freely in Russia.<a id='r2414' /><a href='#f2414' class='c013'><sup>[2414]</sup></a> The <i>Amanita muscaria</i> in France
and Britain is a violent poison, and is considered so even in Russia;<a id='r2415' /><a href='#f2415' class='c013'><sup>[2415]</sup></a>
but in Kamschatka it yields a beverage which is used as a substitute
for intoxicating liquors.<a id='r2416' /><a href='#f2416' class='c013'><sup>[2416]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>There is some reason to believe also that the weather or period
of the season influences some of the esculent species. Thus Foderé
has mentioned instances of the common morelle having appeared injurious
after long-continued rain.<a id='r2417' /><a href='#f2417' class='c013'><sup>[2417]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Even the <i>Agaricus campestris</i> or common mushroom is generally
believed to become somewhat unsafe towards the close of the season,
or as it turns old. Its external characters at that time are sensibly
altered; the margin of the cap is more acute, its white colour less
lively, and the fleshy hue of its lamellæ is changed to brown or
black. In this state, however, I have often eaten it freely and with
impunity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cooking produces some difference on their effects. The very best
of them are indigestible when raw; and some of the poisonous species
may lose in part their deleterious qualities when cooked, because
heat expels the volatile principle; but, on the whole, I believe
the effect of cooking has not been satisfactorily shown to be considerable.
Dr. Pouchet of Rouen seems to have clearly proved, that the
poisonous properties of two of the most deadly fungi, the <i>Amanita
muscaria</i> and <i>A. venenata</i>, may be entirely removed by boiling them
in water. A quart of water, in which five plants had been boiled
for fifteen minutes, killed a dog in eight hours, and again another in
a day; but the boiled fungi themselves had no effect at all on two
other dogs; and a third, which had been fed for two months on little
else than boiled amanitas, not only sustained no harm, but actually
got fat on this fare.<a id='r2418' /><a href='#f2418' class='c013'><sup>[2418]</sup></a> Pouchet is inclined to think that the whole
poisonous plants of the family are similarly circumstanced.—On the
other hand some cryptogamous botanists have maintained that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_703'>703</span>qualities of the esculent mushrooms are injured by cooking, and that
when used in the raw state they may be taken for a long time as a
principal article of food without injury. This statement, as to the
effect of mushrooms when used for a length of time as food, will be
more fully considered presently. It is easy to understand how boiling
may remove their active properties, although other modes of cookery
may not do so. Roasting had no effect in impairing the activity of
<i>Agaricus procerus</i> in the case observed by Dr. Peddie.</p>

<p class='c006'>On certain persons all mushrooms, even the very best of the eatable
kinds, act more or less injuriously. They cause vomiting, diarrhœa,
and colic. In this respect they are on the same footing with
the richer sorts of fish, which by idiosyncrasy act as poisons on particular
constitutions. It is probably under this head that we must
arrange an extraordinary case mentioned by Sage of a man who died
soon after eating a pound of truffles. He was seized with headache,
a sense of weight in the stomach, and faintness; and he lived only a
few hours.<a id='r2419' /><a href='#f2419' class='c013'><sup>[2419]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Lastly, it is not improbable from a singular set of cases to be related
presently, that, contrary to what some botanists have alleged, the
best mushrooms when taken in large quantity, and for a considerable
length of time, are deleterious to every one.</p>

<p class='c006'>Foderé,<a id='r2420' /><a href='#f2420' class='c013'><sup>[2420]</sup></a> Orfila,<a id='r2421' /><a href='#f2421' class='c013'><sup>[2421]</sup></a> Decandolle,<a id='r2422' /><a href='#f2422' class='c013'><sup>[2422]</sup></a> and Greville,<a id='r2423' /><a href='#f2423' class='c013'><sup>[2423]</sup></a> have laid down
general directions for distinguishing the esculent from the poisonous
varieties; but it is extremely questionable whether their rules
are always safe; and certainly they are not always accurate, as they
would exclude many species in common use on the continent. It
appears that most fungi which have a warty cap, more especially
fragments of membrane adhering to their upper surface, are poisonous.
Heavy fungi, which have an unpleasant odour, especially
if they emerge from a <i>vulva</i> or bag, are also generally hurtful. Of
those which grow in woods and shady places a few are esculent,
but most are unwholesome; and if moist on the surface they should
be avoided. All those which grow in tufts or clusters from the
trunks or stumps of trees ought likewise to be shunned. A sure
test of a poisonous fungus is an astringent, styptic taste, and perhaps
also a disagreeable, but certainly a pungent, odour. Some fungi
possessing these properties have indeed found their way to the
epicure’s table; but they are of very questionable quality. Those
whose substance becomes blue soon after being cut are invariably
poisonous. Agarics of an orange or rose-red colour, and boleti
which are coriaceous or corky, or which have a membranous collar
round the stem, are also unsafe; but these rules are not universally
applicable in other genera. Even the esculent mushrooms, if
partially devoured and abandoned by insects, are avoided by some
as having in all probability acquired injurious qualities which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_704'>704</span>do not usually possess; but this test I have often disregarded.—These
rules for knowing deleterious fungi seem to rest on fact and
experience; but they will not enable the collector to recognise every
poisonous species. The general rules laid down for distinguishing
wholesome fungi are not so well founded, and therefore it appears
necessary to specify them.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>On the Poisonous Principle of the Fungi.</i>—Few attempts have
been hitherto made to discover by chemical analysis the principles
on which the effects of the poisonous mushrooms depend. M. Braconnot
analyzed a considerable number both of the esculent and
poisonous species, and found in some a saccharine matter, in others
an acrid resin, in others an acrid volatile principle, and in all a
spongy substance, which forms the basis of them, and which he has
denominated fungin.<a id='r2424' /><a href='#f2424' class='c013'><sup>[2424]</sup></a> The last ingredient is innocuous, and it
does not appear that M. Braconnot could trace the peculiar powers
of the fungi to any of the acrid principles. The subject was afterwards
resumed by M. Letellier, who says he found in some of them
one, in others two poisonous principles. One of these is an acrid
matter so fugacious, that it disappears when the plant is either dried,
or boiled, or macerated in weak acids, alkalis, or alcohol. To this principle
he says are owing the irritant properties of some fungi. The
other principle is more fixed, as it resists drying, boiling, and the
action of weak alkalis and acids. It is soluble in water, has neither
smell nor taste, and forms crystallizable salts with acids; but he
did not succeed in separating it in a state of purity. To this principle
he attributes the narcotic properties of the fungi. He found
it in the <i>Amanita bulbosa</i>, <i>muscaria</i>, and <i>verna</i>; and he therefore
proposed to call it amanitine. Its effects on animals appear to resemble
considerably those of opium.<a id='r2425' /><a href='#f2425' class='c013'><sup>[2425]</sup></a>—Chansarel found that the
poisonous principle resides in the juice, and not in the fleshy part
after it is well washed.<a id='r2426' /><a href='#f2426' class='c013'><sup>[2426]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of the Symptoms produced in Man by the Poisonous Fungi.</i>—The
mode of action of the poisonous fungi has not been particularly examined;
but the experiments of Paulet long ago established that they
are poisonous to animals as well as to man.<a id='r2427' /><a href='#f2427' class='c013'><sup>[2427]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The symptoms produced by them in man are endless in variety,
and fully substantiate the propriety of arranging them in the class of
narcotico-acrid poisons. Sometimes they produce narcotic symptoms
alone, sometimes only symptoms of irritation, but much more commonly
both together. It is likewise not improbable, that fungi, even
though not belonging to the varieties commonly acknowledged as poisons,
induce, when taken for a considerable length of time, a peculiar
depraved state of the constitution, leading to external suppuration
and gangrene. Each of these statements will now be illustrated
by a few examples.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_705'>705</span>The following is a good instance of pure narcotism. A man
gathered in Hyde Park a considerable number of the <i>Agaricus campanulatus</i>
by mistake for the <i>A. campestris</i>, stewed them, and proceeded
to eat them; but before ending his repast, and not above ten
minutes after he began it, he was suddenly attacked with dimness of
vision, giddiness, debility, trembling, and loss of recollection. In a
short time he recovered so far as to be able to go in search of assistance.
But he had hardly walked 250 yards when his memory
again failed him, and he lost his way. His countenance expressed
anxiety, he reeled about, and could hardly articulate. The pulse
was slow and feeble. He soon became so drowsy that he could be
kept awake only by constant dragging. Vomiting was then produced
by means of sulphate of zinc; the drowsiness gradually went
off; and next day he complained merely of languor and weakness.<a id='r2428' /><a href='#f2428' class='c013'><sup>[2428]</sup></a>—An
equally remarkable set of cases of pure narcotism, which occurred
a few years ago in this city, has been related by Dr. Peddie.
Half an hour after eating the <i>Agaricus procerus</i>, an elderly man
and a boy of thirteen were attacked with giddiness and staggering,
as if they were intoxicated; and in an hour they became insensible,
the man indeed so much so that for some time he could not be
roused by any means. Emetics having little effect, the stomach was
cleared out by the pump, and powerful stimulants were employed
both inwardly and outwardly, by means of which sensibility was in
some degree restored. Occasional convulsive spasms ensued, and afterwards
furious delirium, attended with frantic cries and vehement resistance
to remedies, and followed by a state like delirium tremens.
The pupils were at first much contracted, afterwards considerably
dilated as sensibility returned, and in the boy contracted while he
lay torpid, but dilated when he was roused. In neither instance
was there any pain felt at any time; nor were the bowels affected.
Another boy who took a small quantity only had no other symptom
but giddiness, drowsiness, and debility.<a id='r2429' /><a href='#f2429' class='c013'><sup>[2429]</sup></a>—A singular form of
the narcotic effects of the fungi occurred in the case of a boy of fourteen,
who had eaten the <i>Agaricus panterinus</i> near Bologna. In the
course of two hours he was seized with delirium, a maniacal disposition
to rove, and some convulsive movements. Ere long these
symptoms were succeeded by a state resembling coma in every
way, except that he looked as if he understood what was going on:
and in point of fact really did so. He recovered speedily under the
use of emetics.<a id='r2430' /><a href='#f2430' class='c013'><sup>[2430]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In the next set of cases the symptoms were those of almost pure
irritation. Several French soldiers in Russia ate a large quantity
of the <i>Amanita muscaria</i>, which they had mistaken for the <i>Amanita
cæsarea</i>. Some were not taken ill for six hours and upwards. Four
of them, who were very powerful men, thought themselves safe, because
while their companions were already suffering, they themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_706'>706</span>felt perfectly well; and they refused to take emetics. In the
evening, however, they began to complain of anxiety, a sense of
suffocation, frequent fainting, burning thirst, and violent gripes. The
pulse became small and irregular, and the body bedewed with cold
sweat; the lineaments of the countenance were singularly changed,
the nose and lips acquiring a violet tint; they trembled much; the
belly swelled, and a profuse fetid diarrhœa supervened. The extremities
soon became livid, and the pain of the abdomen intense;
delirium ensued; and all four died.<a id='r2431' /><a href='#f2431' class='c013'><sup>[2431]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Such cases, however, do not appear to be very common; and much
more generally the symptoms of poisoning with the fungi present a
well-marked conjunction of deep narcotism and violent irritation, as
the instances now to be mentioned will show.</p>

<p class='c006'>Besides the four soldiers whose cases have just been described,
several of their comrades were severely affected, but recovered.
Two of these had weak pulse, tense and painful belly, partial cold
sweats, fetid breath and stools. In the afternoon they became delirious,
then comatose, and the coma lasted twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class='c006'>A man, his wife, and three children, ate to dinner carp stewed by
mistake with the <i>Amanita citrina</i>. The wife, the servant, and one
of the children had vomiting, followed by deep sopor; but they recovered.
The husband had true and violent cholera, but recovered
also. The two other children became profoundly lethargic and
comatose, emetics had no effect, and death soon ensued without any
other remarkable symptom. The individuals who recovered were
not completely well till three weeks after the fatal repast.<a id='r2432' /><a href='#f2432' class='c013'><sup>[2432]</sup></a> This set
of cases shows the tendency of the poisonous fungi to cause in one
person pure irritation, and in another pure narcotism.</p>

<p class='c006'>The last set of cases to be mentioned were produced by the <i>Hypophyllum
sanguineum</i>, a small conical fungus of a mouse colour, well
known to children in Scotland by the name of <i>puddock-stool</i>. This
species seems to cause convulsions as well as sopor. A family of six
persons, four of whom were children, ate about two pounds of it
dressed with butter. The incipient symptoms were pain in the pit of
the stomach, a sense of impending suffocation, and violent efforts to
vomit; which symptoms did not commence in any of them till about
twelve hours after the poisonous meal, in one not till twenty hours,
and in another not till nearly thirty hours. One of the children,
seven years of age, had acute pain of the belly, which soon swelled
enormously; afterwards he fell into a state of lethargic sleep, but continued
to cry; about twenty-four hours after eating the fungi the
limbs became affected with permanent spasms and convulsive fits;
and in no long time he expired in a tetanic paroxysm. Another
of the children, ten years old, perished nearly in the same manner,
but with convulsions of greater violence. The mother had frequent
bloody stools and vomiting; the skin became yellow; the muscles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_707'>707</span>of the abdomen were contracted spasmodically, so that the navel was
drawn towards the spine; profound lethargy and general coldness
supervened; and she too died about thirty-six hours after eating the
fungus. A third child, after slight symptoms of amendment had
shown themselves, became worse again, and died on the third day
with trembling, delirium, and convulsions. This patient, who had
taken very little of the poison, was not attacked till about thirty
hours after the meal. The fourth child, after precursory symptoms
like those of the rest, became delirious, and had an attack of colic
and inflammation of the bowels, without diarrhœa; but he eventually
recovered. The father had a severe attack of dysentery for three
days, and remained five days speechless. For a long time afterwards
he had occasional bloody diarrhœa; and, although he eventually
recovered, his health continued to suffer for an entire year.<a id='r2433' /><a href='#f2433' class='c013'><sup>[2433]</sup></a>
The cases now mentioned illustrate clearly the simultaneous occurrence
of narcotic and irritant symptoms in the same individuals.</p>

<p class='c006'>A striking circumstance in respect to the symptoms of poisoning
with the fungi, is the great difference in the interval which elapses
before they begin. In the first case the symptoms appear to have
commenced in a few minutes; but, on the contrary, an interval of
twelve hours is common; and Gmelin has quoted a set of cases,
seventeen in number, in which, as in one of those related by Picco,
the interval is said to have been a day and a half.<a id='r2434' /><a href='#f2434' class='c013'><sup>[2434]</sup></a> The tardiness of
the approach of the symptoms is owing to the indigestibility of most
of the fungi. Their indigestibility is in fact so great, that portions of
them have been discharged by vomiting so late as fifty-two hours
after they were swallowed.<a id='r2435' /><a href='#f2435' class='c013'><sup>[2435]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Another circumstance, worthy of particular notice, is the great
durability of the symptoms. Even the purely narcotic effects of
some fungi have been known to last above two days. In the instance
just alluded to, the vomiting of the poison was the first thing that interrupted
a state of deep lethargy, which had prevailed for fifty-two
hours. The symptoms of irritation, after their violence has been mitigated,
might continue, as in the instance quoted from Orfila, for
about three weeks.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was stated above, that some people are apt to suffer unpleasant
effects from eating even the best and safest of the esculent mushrooms.
These effects, which depend on idiosyncrasy, are confined
chiefly to an attack of vomiting and purging, followed by more or
less indigestion. Some persons have been similarly affected, even
by the small portion of mushroom-juice which is contained in an ordinary
ketchup seasoning. This accident, however, may very well
be often unconnected with idiosyncrasy; as I have seen those who
gather mushrooms near Edinburgh, for the purpose of making ketchup,
picking up every fungus that came in their way.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is some reason for suspecting that even the best mushrooms,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_708'>708</span>when taken as a principal article of food for a considerable length of
time, will prove injurious, and that they then induce a peculiar depraved
habit, which leads to external suppuration and gangrene.
The only cases which have hitherto appeared in support of this statement,
were lately published in Rust’s Journal. A family, consisting
of the mother and four children, were seized with a kind of tertian
fever, and the formation of abscesses, which discharged a thin, ill-conditioned
pus, passed rapidly into spreading gangrene, and proved
fatal to the mother and one of the children. No other cause could
be discovered to account for so extraordinary a conjunction of symptoms
in so many individuals, except that for two months they had
lived almost entirely on mushrooms; and the probability of this being
really the cause, was strengthened by the fact, that the father who
slept always with his family, and who alone escaped, lived on ordinary
food at a place where he worked not far off.<a id='r2436' /><a href='#f2436' class='c013'><sup>[2436]</sup></a> In opposition,
however, to the natural inference from this narrative, some have believed,
that mushrooms may be safely eaten to a large amount and
for a long time, provided they be used raw. A botanist of Persoon’s
acquaintance, while studying the cryptogamous plants in the
vicinity of Nuremberg, says he found that the peasants ate them in
large quantities as their daily food; and, in imitation of their custom,
he ate for several weeks nothing but bread and raw mushrooms; yet
at the end he experienced an increase rather than a diminution of
strength, and enjoyed perfect health. He adds that they lose their
good qualities by cooking; but he has supplied no facts in support
of that statement.<a id='r2437' /><a href='#f2437' class='c013'><sup>[2437]</sup></a> It is said that eatable fungi, used for a considerable
time as a principal article of food, as in Russia, cause
greenness of the skin.<a id='r2438' /><a href='#f2438' class='c013'><sup>[2438]</sup></a> There is no reason for supposing, as some
have done,<a id='r2439' /><a href='#f2439' class='c013'><sup>[2439]</sup></a> that wholesome mushrooms may produce the effects of
the poisonous kinds, if eaten in large quantity.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of the Morbid Appearances.</i>—The morbid appearances left in the
bodies of persons poisoned by this deleterious fungi have been but
imperfectly collected.</p>

<p class='c006'>The body is in general very livid, and the blood fluid; so much
so sometimes, that it flows from the natural openings in the dead
body.<a id='r2440' /><a href='#f2440' class='c013'><sup>[2440]</sup></a> In general, the abdomen is distended with fetid air, which,
indeed, is usually present during life. The stomach and small intestines
of the four French soldiers (p. <a href='#Page_705'>705</a>), presented the appearance
of inflammation passing in some places to gangrene. In two of them
especially, the stomach was gangrenous in many places, and far advanced
in putrefaction. The same appearances were found in Picco’s
cases. In these there was also an excessive enlargement of the liver.
The lungs have sometimes been found gorged or even inflamed. The
vessels of the brain are also sometimes very turgid. They were particularly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_709'>709</span>so in a case related by Dr. Beck, where death was occasioned
in seven hours by an infusion of the <i>Amanita muscaria</i> in milk.
The whole sinuses of the dura mater, as well as the arteries were
enormously distended with blood; the arachnoid and pia mater were
of a scarlet colour; the vessels of the membrane between the convolutions,
together with the plexus choroides, were also excessively
gorged; and the substance of the brain was red. Lastly, a clot of
blood, as big as a bean, was found in the cerebellum.<a id='r2441' /><a href='#f2441' class='c013'><sup>[2441]</sup></a>—The stomach,
unless there had been vomiting or diarrhœa, will usually contain
fragments of the poison, if it has not been taken in a state of
minute division; and this evidence of the cause of death may be
obtained, even although the individual survived two days or upwards.
Sometimes fragments are found in the intestines. In one
of Picco’s patients who lived twenty-four hours, there was found in
the neighbourhood of the ileo-cæcal valve, which was much inflamed.<a id='r2442' /><a href='#f2442' class='c013'><sup>[2442]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of the Treatment.</i>—The treatment of poisoning with the fungi
does not call for any special observations. Emetics are of primary
importance; and after the poison has been by their means dislodged,
the sopor and inflammation of the bowels are to be treated in the
usual way. No antidote is known. Several have at different times
been a good deal confided in; but none are of any material service.
Chansarel found acids useless, but thought infusion of galls
advantageous.<a id='r2443' /><a href='#f2443' class='c013'><sup>[2443]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In concluding the present chapter it is necessary to take notice of
a variety of poisoning, not altogether unimportant in a medico-legal
point of view. A person may seem to die of poisoning with the deleterious
fungi, from eating esculent mushrooms intentionally drugged
with some other vegetable or mineral poison. It must be confessed,
that if the murderer is dexterous in the choice and mode of administering
the poison, such cases might readily escape suspicion, and
even when suspected might not be cleared up without difficulty.
The ascertaining the species of mushroom, by finding others where
it has been gathered, will not supply more than presumptive proof of
the wholesomeness of that which has been eaten; because the esculent
and poisonous species sometimes grow near one another, and
have a mutual resemblance, so that a mistake may easily occur.
The presumption may be somewhat strengthened by evidence derived
from the interval which elapses before the symptoms begin,
from the nature and progress of the symptoms themselves, and from
the morbid appearances. Some one or other of these circumstances
may establish the fact of poisoning with a deleterious fungi. It is
impossible, however, that they shall ever establish satisfactorily that
the fungus was naturally wholesome; and, on the whole, the only
decided evidence of poisoning by some other means will be the actual
discovery of another poison.</p>

<p class='c006'>The case now under consideration is not a mere hypothetical one.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_710'>710</span>Ernest Platner has related a very interesting example, which proves
how easily poisoning of the kind supposed may be accomplished
without suspicion. A servant-girl poisoned her mistress by mixing
oxide of arsenic with a dish of mushrooms. She died in twenty
hours, after suffering severely from vomiting and colic pains. On
dissection there were found inflammation of the stomach, gangrenous
spots in it, clots of blood in its contents, and redness of the intestines.
Her death, however, was ascribed to the mushrooms having
been unwholesome; and the real cause was not discovered till thirteen
years after, when the girl was convicted of murdering a fellow-servant
in a somewhat similar way by mixing arsenic with her chocolate,
and then confessed both crimes.<a id='r2444' /><a href='#f2444' class='c013'><sup>[2444]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Poisonous Mosses.</i>—It is not improbable that some of the mosses
possess poisonous properties similar to those of the deleterious fungi.
Dr. Winkler of Innsbruch mentions that the <i>Lycopodium selago</i> is
used in the Tyrol in the way of infusion for killing vermin on animals;
and that unpleasant accidents have been produced in man by
its accidental use. Its effects appear to be sometimes irritant, but
more generally narcotic in their nature.<a id='r2445' /><a href='#f2445' class='c013'><sup>[2445]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XL.<br /> <span class='small'>OF THE EFFECTS OF POISONOUS GRAIN AND PULSE.</span></h3>

<p class='c005'>The different sorts of grain are subject to certain diseases, in consequence
of which meal or flour made from them is apt to be impregnated
with substances more or less injurious to animal life. It
is likewise believed, that unripe grain possesses properties which
render it to a certain extent unfit for the food of man.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is for the most part difficult to trace satisfactorily the operation
of the poisons now alluded to, because they are seen acting only in
times of famine and general distress, when it is not always easy to
make due allowance for the effect of collateral circumstances. There
is one poison of the kind, however, whose baneful influence has been
so frequently and unequivocally witnessed, that no doubt now exists
regarding its properties, I mean <i>spurred rye</i>, or <i>ergot</i>. It is a poison
of no great consequence, perhaps, to the English toxicologist; for
indeed I am not aware that a single instance of its operation has
hitherto been observed in Britain.<a id='r2446' /><a href='#f2446' class='c013'><sup>[2446]</sup></a> But its effects are so singular,
and the ravages it has often committed on the continent have been
so dreadful, that a short account of it cannot fail to interest even the
English reader. Besides, it has lately been introduced into the materia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_711'>711</span>medica, as possessing very extraordinary medicinal qualities;
and since its use is gaining ground, every medical jurist ought to
be conversant with its properties as a poison. I have also met with
an instance where it was administered for the purpose of procuring
miscarriage.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Spurred Rye.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'><i>Spurred Rye</i>, or <i>Secale cornutum</i>, the <i>Seigle ergoté</i>, or <i>Ergot</i> of
the French, and <i>Mutterkorn</i>, or <i>Roggenmutter</i>, of the Germans, is a
disease common to various grains, in consequence of which the place
of the pickle is supplied by a long, black substance, like a little horn
or spur. It has been known to attack many plants of the order
Graminaceæ;<a id='r2447' /><a href='#f2447' class='c013'><sup>[2447]</sup></a> and among those used as food by man, it has been
observed on barley, oats, spring-wheat, winter-wheat, and rye. But
the rye seems peculiarly subject to it, almost all the poison which
has caused epidemics, as well as what is now used in medicine,
being produced by that grain.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of the Cause and Nature of the Spur in Rye.</i>—The spur attacks
rye chiefly in damp seasons, and in moist clay soils, particularly
those recently redeemed from waste lands in the neighbourhood of
forests. Of all the places where the spur has been hitherto observed
none combines these conditions so perfectly, and none has been so
much infested with the disease, as the district of Sologne, situated
between the rivers Loire and Cher, in France. According to the
statistical researches of the <i>Abbé Tessier</i>, who in 1777 was deputed
by the Parisian Society of Medicine to investigate the causes of the
extraordinary prevalence of the ergot in that district, the country
was then so much intersected by belts of wood around the fields,
that the traveller in passing along might imagine he was constantly
approaching an immense forest; the arable land was so poor, that,
although it lay fallow every third season, it was exhausted in nine or
twelve years at farthest, and then remained a long time in pasture
before it could again bear white crops; the surface was so level, and
consequently so wet, that crops were obtained only when the seed
was sown on the tops of furrows a foot high; and the climate is so
moist, that from the month of September till late in spring the whole
country is overhung by dense fogs.<a id='r2448' /><a href='#f2448' class='c013'><sup>[2448]</sup></a> Here the rye, the common
food of the peasantry, appears to have been in Tessier’s time more
liable to be attacked by the spur than in any other part of the continent.
Tessier found, that after being thrashed it contained on an
average about a forty-eighth part of ergot, even in good seasons;
but in bad seasons, and taking into account a considerable proportion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_712'>712</span>which is shaken out of the ears and sheaves before they reach
the barn, the proportion of ergot in the whole crop has been estimated
so high as a fourth or even a third. In Sologne the disease
was farther observed by Tessier to be always most prevalent in the
dampest parts of a field, and to affect above all the first crop of
fields redeemed from waste land, or from land which had previously
been for some time in pasture.<a id='r2449' /><a href='#f2449' class='c013'><sup>[2449]</sup></a> The same connexion between
moisture and the development of the ergot has been repeatedly traced
in other parts of France, as well as in Germany.<a id='r2450' /><a href='#f2450' class='c013'><sup>[2450]</sup></a> And according
to the experiments of Wildenow, it may be brought on at any time,
by sowing the rye in a rich damp soil, and watering the plants exuberantly
in warm weather.<a id='r2451' /><a href='#f2451' class='c013'><sup>[2451]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Opinions are much divided as to the cause and nature of the spur.
It had been conceived by some that nothing else is required for its
production but undue moisture combined with warmth; and that
under these circumstances the spur is formed simply by a diseased
process from the juices of the plant.<a id='r2452' /><a href='#f2452' class='c013'><sup>[2452]</sup></a> By others, such as Tillet,
Fontana, and Réad, who also consider it to be simply a diseased
formation, it has been held to arise from the germen being punctured
when young by an insect;<a id='r2453' /><a href='#f2453' class='c013'><sup>[2453]</sup></a> and in support of this statement,
General Field says he saw flies puncture the glumes in their milky
state where spurs afterwards formed, and imitating the operation
with a needle obtained the same result.<a id='r2454' /><a href='#f2454' class='c013'><sup>[2454]</sup></a> On the other hand, Decandolle,
reviving a previous doctrine that the spur is a kind of
fungus, conceived he had given strong grounds for believing this
excrescence to be a species of <i>sclerotium</i>, which he terms <i>S. clavus</i>.
Wiggers supports this doctrine by chemical analysis; for he endeavours
to show that the basis of the structure of the spur is almost
identical in chemical properties with the principle fungin.<a id='r2455' /><a href='#f2455' class='c013'><sup>[2455]</sup></a> Lastly,
the most recent researches, those of Smith,<a id='r2456' /><a href='#f2456' class='c013'><sup>[2456]</sup></a> Queckett,<a id='r2457' /><a href='#f2457' class='c013'><sup>[2457]</sup></a> and Bauer,<a id='r2458' /><a href='#f2458' class='c013'><sup>[2458]</sup></a>
founded chiefly on microscopical observations, tend to a union and
modification of these two views,—namely, that the great mass of
the spur is a peculiar morbid formation, and that the whitish bloom
which covers fresh specimens consists of a multitude of microscopic
fungi in the form of <i>sporidia</i>, which thickly envelope and impregnate
the parts of fructification in the nascent state of the embryo, and
are in all probability the exciting cause of the morbid degeneration
of the pickle.<a id='r2459' /><a href='#f2459' class='c013'><sup>[2459]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_713'>713</span>Various opinions have been formed as to the mode of propagation
of the spur. Fontana has alleged that one variety of it may spread
from plant to plant over a field; and that he has expressly transmitted
it by contact from one ear to another.<a id='r2460' /><a href='#f2460' class='c013'><sup>[2460]</sup></a> His opinion and statement
of facts are at variance with experiments lately made by Hertwig, a
German physician, who found that even when the ear while in flower
was surrounded for twelve days with powder of spurred rye, the
healthiness of the future grain was not in the slightest degree affected.<a id='r2461' /><a href='#f2461' class='c013'><sup>[2461]</sup></a>
The same results have also been obtained by Wiggers, and
more recently by Dr. Samuel Wright.<a id='r2462' /><a href='#f2462' class='c013'><sup>[2462]</sup></a> Wiggers, however, although
he could not produce spurs in the way indicated by Fontana, observed
that the white dust on the surface of the spurs will produce
the disease in any plant, if sprinkled in the soil at its roots, appearing
therefore to be analogous to the sporules or spawn of the admitted
fungi. Mr. Queckett has made the most precise experiments on
the mode of reproduction of the disease. He succeeded in infecting
rye repeatedly with ergot by means of the sporidia developed on
the spurs; but it is remarkable that he could not in the same way
infect wheat or barley.<a id='r2463' /><a href='#f2463' class='c013'><sup>[2463]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Description and analysis of Spurred Rye.</i>—The spur varies in
length from a few lines to two inches, and is from two to four lines
in thickness. If it is long, there is seldom more than one or two on a
single ear, and the remaining pickles of the ear are healthy. But
the ears which have small spurs have generally several, sometimes
even twenty; and when there are many, few of the remaining pickles
are altogether without blackness at the tips.<a id='r2464' /><a href='#f2464' class='c013'><sup>[2464]</sup></a> The substance of the
spur is of a pale grayish-red tint; and externally it is bluish-black or
violet, with two, sometimes three, streaks of dotted gray. It is
specifically lighter than water, while sound rye is specifically heavier,
so that they are easily separated from one another.<a id='r2465' /><a href='#f2465' class='c013'><sup>[2465]</sup></a> It is tough and
flexible when fresh, brittle and easily pulverized when dry. The
powder is disposed to attract moisture. It has a disagreeable heavy
smell, a nauseous, slightly acrid taste, and imparts its taste and smell
both to water and alcohol. Bread which contains it is defective in
firmness, liable to become moist, and cracks and crumbles soon after
being taken from the oven.<a id='r2466' /><a href='#f2466' class='c013'><sup>[2466]</sup></a>—It is easily known, when entire, by
its external characters. Its powder, which is of an obscure grayish-red
hue, is best known by the action of solution of potash, which
immediately disengages a powerful odour of ergot, and forms a lake-red
pulp; and this pulp yields by filtration a splendid lake-red solution,
which gives a beautiful lake-red flaky precipitate, when either
neutralized by nitric acid, or treated with an excess of solution of
alum.</p>

<p class='c006'>Spurred rye has been repeatedly subjected to analysis. The earlier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_714'>714</span>researches of Vauquelin<a id='r2467' /><a href='#f2467' class='c013'><sup>[2467]</sup></a> and of Pettenkofer<a id='r2468' /><a href='#f2468' class='c013'><sup>[2468]</sup></a> do not lead to any
pointed results. The presence of hydrocyanic acid indicated by
Robert,<a id='r2469' /><a href='#f2469' class='c013'><sup>[2469]</sup></a> would not account for the very peculiar effects of ergot, and
has besides been denied by Wiggers. Winkler obtained various
principles from it, and among the rest a thick, rancid, slightly acrid
oil, and a nauseous, sweetish, acrid fluid; but he did not determine,
any more than his predecessors, in which of these principles the active
properties of the spur reside.<a id='r2470' /><a href='#f2470' class='c013'><sup>[2470]</sup></a> Wiggers supplied more definite information
on the subject. He denies the presence of hydrocyanic
acid, and says he found ergot to consist chiefly of a heavy-smelling
fixed oil, fungin, albumen, osmazome, waxy matter, and an extractive
substance of a strong, peculiar taste and smell, in which, from
experiments on animals, he was led to infer that its active properties
reside. I have obtained all his chief results, except the most important
of them; for the substance which ought to have been his ergotin
was destitute of marked taste or smell of any kind.<a id='r2471' /><a href='#f2471' class='c013'><sup>[2471]</sup></a> Dr. Wright
too could not obtain the ergotin of Wiggers, and concludes from his
own experiments, that the spur consists of fungin, modified starch,
mucilage, gluten, osmazome, colouring matter, various salts, and
thirty-one per cent. of fixed oil, in which the active properties of the
poison seemed to him to reside.<a id='r2472' /><a href='#f2472' class='c013'><sup>[2472]</sup></a> Buchner, however, thinks that the
oil is not itself active, but owes its apparent energy to an acrid principle
which alcohol removes from it, and which is not removed from
the crude substance in separating the oil in the usual way by sulphuric
ether, unless the ether be somewhat alcoholized.<a id='r2473' /><a href='#f2473' class='c013'><sup>[2473]</sup></a> However this
may be, it seems ascertained by the experiments of Dr. Wright, that
the fixed oil, obtained by means of common ether, concentrates in
itself the peculiar properties possessed by ergot, either in small doses
as a medicine, or in a single large dose as a poison.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Effects of Spurred Rye on Man and Animals.</i>—Before proceeding
to relate the effects of this poison on man, it should be mentioned,
that at different times doubts have been entertained, whether the
baneful effects ascribed to it might not really arise from some other
cause. But independently of the connexion which has been frequently
traced between the poison and the diseases imputed to it in
the human subject, the question has been set at rest by the experiments
which have been tried on animals, and which indeed were
instituted with a view to settle the point in dispute.</p>

<p class='c006'>The experiments hitherto made on animals are variable in their
results, yet sufficient to show that spurred rye is an active poison of
a very peculiar kind. According to the observations collected by
Dr. Robert from a variety of authors, it follows that it is injurious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_715'>715</span>and even fatal to all animals which are fed for a sufficient length of
time with a moderate proportion of it, unless they escape its action
by early vomiting; that dogs and cats, in consequence of discharging
it by vomiting, suffer only slight symptoms of irritant poisoning;—but
that swine, moles, geese, ducks, fowls, quails, sparrows, as well
as leeches and flies, are sooner or later killed by it;—and that the
symptoms it causes in beasts and birds are in the first instance giddiness,
dilated pupil, and palsy, and afterwards diarrhœa, suppurating
tumours, scattered gangrene throughout the body, and sometimes
dropping off of the toes. Wiggers ascertained that nine grains of the
substance he has considered its active principle occasioned in a fowl
dulness, apparent suffering, gradually increasing feebleness, coldness
and insensibility of the extremities, and in three days a fit of convulsions,
ending in death.<a id='r2474' /><a href='#f2474' class='c013'><sup>[2474]</sup></a> Taddei lately found, that sparrows were
killed by six grains of it in six or seven hours, with symptoms merely
of great weakness, torpor, and indisposition to stir.<a id='r2475' /><a href='#f2475' class='c013'><sup>[2475]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Wright, whose experiments are the most extensive and precise
yet made on this subject, found that a single dose, consisting of
a strong infusion of between two drachms and a half and six drachms
of ergot, if introduced into the jugular vein of a dog, occasions death,
sometimes in a few minutes, sometimes not for more than two hours,
with symptoms of alternating spasm and paralysis, occasionally a
tendency to coma, and often depressed or irregular action of the
heart, or even complete arrestment of its function;—that, when introduced
into the cellular tissue, it produces inflammation and suppuration,
sometimes circumscribed, sometimes diffuse, and always
attended with an unhealthy discharge and great exhaustion;—and
that, when admitted into the stomach, it excites irritation of the alimentary
canal, excessive muscular prostration, at first excitability,
but afterwards singular dulness or even complete obliteration of the
senses, and occasional slight spasms; but that it is not a very active
poison through this channel, as above three ounces are required to
prove fatal to a dog. When it was administered in frequent small
doses, he could not observe the effects remarked by Robert, but
found that it induced a peculiar cachectic state, indicated by extreme
muscular emaciation and weakness, loss of appetite, frequency of the
pulse, repulsive fetor of the secretions and excretions, congestion of
the alimentary mucous membrane, excessive contraction of the spleen,
enlargement of the liver and absorbent glands, and non-formation of
callus at the ends of fractured bones.<a id='r2476' /><a href='#f2476' class='c013'><sup>[2476]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>With regard to its effects on man, it has been found by express
experiment, that a single dose of two drachms excites giddiness,
headache, flushed face, pain and spasms in the stomach, nausea, and
vomiting, colic, purging, and a sense of weariness and weight in the
limbs.<a id='r2477' /><a href='#f2477' class='c013'><sup>[2477]</sup></a> But it is not in this way that it has been usually introduced
into the system; nor are these precisely the symptoms already hinted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_716'>716</span>at as particular in its action. The effects now to be mentioned form
a peculiar disease, which has often prevailed epidemically in different
territories on the continent, and which arises from the spur being
allowed to mix with the grain in the meal, and being taken as food
for a continuance of time in rye-bread. The affection produced differs
much in different epidemics and even in different cases of the
same epidemic. Two distinct disorders have been noticed; the one
a nervous disease, characterized by violent spasmodic convulsions;
the other a depraved state of the constitution, which ends in that remarkable
disorder, dry gangrene; and it does not appear that the two
affections are apt to be blended together in the same case.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first form of disease, the <i>convulsive ergotism</i> of the French
writers, has been very well described by Taube, a German physician,
as it occurred in the north of Germany in 1770–1. In its most acute
form, it commenced suddenly with dimness of sight, giddiness and
loss of sensibility, followed soon by dreadful cramps and convulsions
of the whole body, <i>risus sardonicus</i>, yellowness of the countenance,
excessive thirst, excruciating pains in the limbs and chest, and a
small, often imperceptible pulse. Such cases usually proved fatal in
twenty-four or forty-eight hours. In the milder cases the convulsions
came on in paroxysms, were preceded for some days by weakness
and weight of the limbs, and a strange feeling as of insects crawling
over the legs, arms, and face; in the intervals between the fits the
appetite was voracious, the pulse natural, the excretions regular; and
the disease either terminated in recovery, with scattered suppurations,
cutaneous eruptions, anasarca or diarrhœa, or it proved in the end
fatal amidst prolonged sopor and convulsions.<a id='r2478' /><a href='#f2478' class='c013'><sup>[2478]</sup></a> Another more recent
and very clear account of this form of the disease has been given by
Dr. Wagner of Schlieben from his experience of an epidemic which
prevailed in the neighbourhood of that place so lately as the years
1831 and 1832. In consequence of unusual moisture and late frosts
in the summer of 1831, the rye was so much spurred in many fields
that a fifth at least of the pickles was diseased. As soon as the country
people proceeded to use the new rye, convulsive ergotism began
to show itself, and it recurred more or less till next midsummer,
when the diseased grain was all consumed. The usual symptoms
were at first periodic weariness, afterwards an uneasy sense of contraction
in the hands and feet, and at length violent and permanent
contraction of the flexor muscles of the arms, legs, feet, hands, fingers
and toes, with frequent attacks of a sense of burning or creeping
on the skin. These were the essential symptoms; but a great variety
of accessory nervous affections occasionally presented themselves.
There was seldom any disturbance of the mind, except in
some of the fatal cases, where epileptic convulsions and coma preceded
death. Every case was cured by emetics, laxatives, and frequent
small doses of opium, provided it was taken in reasonable time,
and the unwholesome food was completely withdrawn.<a id='r2479' /><a href='#f2479' class='c013'><sup>[2479]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The other form of disease, which has been named <i>gangrenous ergotism</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_717'>717</span>by the French writers, and is known in Germany by the vulgar
name of creeping-sickness (<i>kriebelkrankheit</i>), has been minutely
described by various authors. In the most severe form, as it appeared
in Switzerland in 1709 and 1716, it commenced, according
to Lang, a physician of Lucerne, with general weakness, weariness,
and a feeling as of insects creeping over the skin; when these symptoms
had lasted some days or weeks, the extremities became cold,
white, stiff, benumbed, and at length so insensible that deep incisions
were not felt; then excruciating pains in the limbs supervened,
along with fever, headache, and sometimes bleeding from the nose;
finally the affected parts, and in the first instance the fingers and
arms, afterwards the toes and legs, shrivelled, dried up, and dropped
off by the joints. A healthy granulation succeeded; but the powers
of life were frequently exhausted before that stage was reached. The
appetite, as in the convulsive form of the disease, continued voracious
throughout.<a id='r2480' /><a href='#f2480' class='c013'><sup>[2480]</sup></a> In milder cases, as it prevailed at different times
in France, nausea and vomiting attended the precursory symptoms,
and the gangrenous affection was accompanied with dark vesications.<a id='r2481' /><a href='#f2481' class='c013'><sup>[2481]</sup></a>
In another variety, which has been witnessed in various
parts of Germany, the chief symptoms were spasmodic contraction of
the limbs at first, and afterwards weakness of mind, voracity and
dyspepsia, which, if not followed by recovery, as generally happened,
either terminated in fatuity or in fatal gangrene.<a id='r2482' /><a href='#f2482' class='c013'><sup>[2482]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>These extraordinary and formidable distempers were first referred
to the operation of spurred rye in 1597 by the Marburg Medical
Faculty, who witnessed the ravages of the poison in Hessia during
the preceding year. Since then repeated epidemics have broken
out in Germany, Bohemia, Holstein, Denmark, Sweden, Lombardy,
Switzerland, and France.<a id='r2483' /><a href='#f2483' class='c013'><sup>[2483]</sup></a> About the close of last century,
partly in consequence of the attention of the respective governments
being turned to the subject, partly by reason of the improved
condition of the peasantry in these countries, and the greater rarity of
seasons of famine, the epidemics became much less common or extensive.
Nevertheless the creeping-sickness has been several times
noticed in Germany since the present century began.<a id='r2484' /><a href='#f2484' class='c013'><sup>[2484]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Spurred rye is now generally believed to possess another singular
quality, in consequence of which it has been lately introduced into
the materia medica of this and other countries,—a power of promoting
the contractions of the gravid uterus. This property seems
to have been long familiar to the quacks and midwives of Germany;
and towards the close of last century it rendered ergot so favourite a
remedy with them, that several of the German states prohibited the
use of it by severe statutes.<a id='r2485' /><a href='#f2485' class='c013'><sup>[2485]</sup></a> It was first fairly brought under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_718'>718</span>notice of regular accoucheurs by the physicians of the United States
between the years 1807 and 1814.<a id='r2486' /><a href='#f2486' class='c013'><sup>[2486]</sup></a> There appears little reason for
doubting that it possesses the power of increasing the contractions of
the uterus when unnaturally languid; and consequently it has been
employed, apparently with frequent good effect, to hasten languid
natural labour, to promote the separation of the placenta, and to
quicken the contraction of the womb after delivery. These facts,
however, are mentioned chiefly as preparatory to the statement, that
it has been also supposed to possess the power of producing abortion,
and has been actually employed for that purpose in some foreign
countries, and even in this city. Accurate information is still much
wanted on this subject. No other poison seems so likely to possess
a peculiar property of the kind. Nevertheless it is the opinion of the
best authorities, that spurred rye has no such power, except in connexion
with violent constitutional injury produced by dangerous
doses; and that it is endowed with the property only of accelerating
natural labour, not of inducing it, particularly in the early months of
pregnancy.</p>

<p class='c006'>It seems from the experiments of Dr. Wright to have no power
whatever of inducing miscarriage in the lower animals.<a id='r2487' /><a href='#f2487' class='c013'><sup>[2487]</sup></a> Notwithstanding
the improbability, however, of its possessing the property of
bringing on abortion, it is one of the substances at present occasionally
employed with the view of feloniously causing this accident.
In a case of attempt to procure abortion, which occurred not long
ago in this city, one of the articles repeatedly employed, but without
success, was powder of spurred rye,—as I had occasion to ascertain
by chemical analysis.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of Spurred Maize.</i>—It has been already observed, that many other
plants of the Natural Family of Grasses are subject to the ergot besides
rye. But the only other species in which the disease has been
particularly examined is Indian corn or maize [<i>Zea Mays</i>]. It appears
from the inquiries of M. Roullin that maize is very subject to
the spur in the provinces of Neyba and Maraquita in Colombia; that
the spur forms a black, pear-shaped body on the ear in place of the
pickle; and that in this state the grain, which is known by the name
of <i>maïs peladero</i>, possesses properties injurious to animal life. Its
effects, however, are somewhat different from those of spurred rye.
Men who eat the ergotted maize lose their hair and sometimes their
teeth, but are never attacked with dry gangrene or convulsions.
When swine eat it, which after a time they do with avidity, the
bristles drop off, and the hind-legs become feeble and wasted. Mules
likewise lose their hair, and the hoofs swell. Fowls lay their eggs
without the shell. Apes and parrots, which frequent the fields of
spurred maize, fall down as if drunk; and the native dogs and deer
experience similar effects.<a id='r2488' /><a href='#f2488' class='c013'><sup>[2488]</sup></a></p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_719'>719</span>
  <h4 class='c014'><i>Of the Rust of Wheat.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>There are several other diseases to which grain is liable, and
which are much more common in this country than the ergot. But
very little is known of their effects on the animal body; which circumstance,
since the wheat of this and other countries often suffers
from them, is probably sufficient to show that their influence must be
trifling, or at all events very seldom called forth. Wheat is liable to
three diseases. One is a disease of the stalk and leaf rather than
of the ear, and has the effect of preventing the development of
the ear or its pickles, and of covering the plant with a brown powder.
Of the two other diseases, which both attack the pickles of the
ear, one consists in the substitution of a brown dry powder for the
farina of the pickle, and the other of a deposition of black moist
matter in the fissure of the pickle, the substance of which it also invades
and partially destroys. One of these is called in Scotland
<i>brown rust</i>, the other <i>black rust</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of the three diseases the only one which is apt to infect the flour
is the black rust. The others, as they consist of a light dry powder,
are almost entirely separated in thrashing and winnowing the grain.
But the black rust being damp and adhesive, it is carried along with
the pickles. Such pickles are almost invariably separated by the
farmer if they are abundant; for otherwise, on account of the dark
colour and disagreeable odour of the matter deposited on them, the
flour possesses external qualities which would be at once recognized
by a dealer of ordinary experience.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not improbable, that a moderate impregnation of bread with
the powder formed by the diseases in question may take place, without
leading to any unpleasant effect on the human body. Experiments
to this effect were made by Parmentier with one of them,
termed in France <i>carie</i>, or caries of wheat, which from his description
appears to be the black rust of Scottish farmers. He gave
two dogs each two drachms daily of the powder for fifteen days,
without remarking any sign of ill health. Bread made with wheat
flour containing a 64th of the powder, when eaten by various people,
and Parmentier among the rest, to the amount of a pound daily
for several days, caused slight headache and pain in the stomach the
first day only; and in larger proportion it had as little effect.<a id='r2489' /><a href='#f2489' class='c013'><sup>[2489]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>It appears, then, that the introduction of any deleterious ingredient
into wheat bread is hardly to be dreaded from the common diseases
to which wheat is liable in this country.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Unripe Grain.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Wheat and other grains have been supposed to acquire qualities
detrimental to health, from being cut down while unripe, or used
immediately after being cut down, although ripe. I am not aware
that accidents have ever been traced or even imputed to such causes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_720'>720</span>in this country; and, on the whole, I believe it is generally considered
here, that imperfect ripening of the pickle rather lessens the
quantity, than impairs the quality, of the flour. But several times
epidemics have been ascribed in France to unripe wheat. In 1801
M. Bouvier read a memoir to the Society of Medicine at Paris, ascribing
to new and unripe wheat an epidemic dysentery, which laid
waste several districts of the department of the Oise in the autumn of
1793. These districts abound in small farms of a few acres, on the
produce of which the cultivators depend in great measure for their
subsistence. Hence in unfavourable seasons the corn was commonly
cut down before it was ripe, and made into bread soon after being
reaped. It was accordingly among the peasantry of these farms
only, and not among the agriculturists in large farms, which were
under better management, that the epidemic prevailed. Bouvier remarks,
that at all times when the long continuance of wet weather
has compelled the inhabitants of a district to cut down the wheat
before it is ripe, or a previous dearth has forced them to use it when
newly cut, epidemic disorders of the bowels have been observed to
rage in the latter months of autumn. And as an instance of this he
refers to the year 1783, when the crops around Paris were believed
to have been injured by the extraordinary prevalence of fogs, and
were cut down unripe and used immediately. Various epidemics
broke out in the metropolis, and still more in the surrounding country.<a id='r2490' /><a href='#f2490' class='c013'><sup>[2490]</sup></a>
This is an important subject for farther inquiry; but at present
I cannot help thinking that M. Bouvier exaggerates the effects of the
immaturity of the grain. At all events, the grain is often cut down
in an unripe state in various districts of this country; and I have
never heard that any epidemic diseases were produced. When M.
Bouvier witnessed the epidemic of 1793 in the department of the
Oise, he instructed the inhabitants of his own parish to dry the unripe
corn before thrashing it, to repeat the process before the grain
was converted into flour, and to mix with the flour a larger quantity
than usual of yeast in making it into bread; and he states that in the
succeeding year, which was even more unfavourable to the crops,
they were enabled, by following these directions, to use unripe corn
with safety.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Spoiled Bread.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>This is the fittest opportunity for noticing certain injurious effects
sometimes observed from the use of spoiled or mouldy bread. On
the continent repeated instances have occurred of severe and even
dangerous poisoning from spoiled rye-bread, barley-bread, and even
wheat bread. Several instances have been observed of horses having
been killed in a short space of time with symptoms of irritant
poisoning after eating such bread with their ordinary food.<a id='r2491' /><a href='#f2491' class='c013'><sup>[2491]</sup></a> And
Ur. Westerhoff has given an account of its effects on two children
and several adults. In children the symptoms were redness of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_721'>721</span>features, dry tongue, frequent weak pulse, violent colic pains, urgent
thirst and headache, and subsequently vomiting and diarrhœa, alternating
with great exhaustion and sleepiness. The bread in these
instances was made of rye.<a id='r2492' /><a href='#f2492' class='c013'><sup>[2492]</sup></a> It appears that in bread so spoiled a
variety of mucedinous vegetables are developed, especially the
<i>Penicillium glaucum</i> and <i>P. roseum</i>; and it is imagined by some, that
this circumstance may account for the deleterious effect of the
bread.<a id='r2493' /><a href='#f2493' class='c013'><sup>[2493]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of the Effects of Darnel-Grass.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Grain is also rendered more or less injurious by the accidental or
intentional admixture of a variety of foreign substances, by which,
in common speech, it is said to be adulterated. The subject of the
adulteration of grain is a very important topic in medical police.
But as this practice seldom imparts to the grain qualities decidedly
poisonous, the consideration of it would be misplaced here. One
variety, however, the accidental adulteration of flour with the seeds
of the <i>Lolium temulentum</i> or darnel-grass calls for some notice; for
it may occasion not only symptoms of poisoning, but even also death
itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is the only poisonous species of the natural order of the
grasses. The seeds appear to be powerfully narcotic, and at the
same time to possess acrid properties. Seeger gave a dog three
ounces of a decoction of the flour, and observed that it was seized
in five hours with violent trembling and great feebleness, which
were succeeded in four hours by sopor and insensibility; but it recovered
next day.<a id='r2494' /><a href='#f2494' class='c013'><sup>[2494]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>When mixed with bread and taken habitually by man, darnel-grass
has been known to cause headache, giddiness, somnolency,
delirium, convulsions, paralysis, and even death. M. Cordier found
by experiment on himself, that very soon after eating bread containing
darnel-grass flour, he felt confusion of sight and ideas,
languor, heaviness, and alternate attacks of somnolency and vomiting.
The bread was commonly vomited soon after he ate it.<a id='r2495' /><a href='#f2495' class='c013'><sup>[2495]</sup></a> Seeger has
related some cases in which the somnolency was much more deep;
and states that general tremors are almost always present.<a id='r2496' /><a href='#f2496' class='c013'><sup>[2496]</sup></a> A few
years ago almost the whole inmates of the Poor’s House at Sheffield,
to the amount of eighty, were attacked with analogous symptoms after
breakfasting on oatmeal porridge; and it was supposed that the meal had
been accidentally adulterated with the lolium. The chief symptoms
were a piercing stare, violent agitation of the limbs, quivering of the
lips, frontal headache, confusion of sight, dilated pupil, small tremulous
pulse, twitches of the muscles, and palpitation. In twelve
hours all of the persons attacked were well but two, who had strong
convulsions in the subsequent night, but also eventually recovered.<a id='r2497' /><a href='#f2497' class='c013'><sup>[2497]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_722'>722</span>A similar accident is mentioned by Perleb, as having happened at
Freyburg in the House of Correction. The inmates, soon after
eating bread made with new flour, were attacked to the number of
forty, with loss of speech and somnolency; and for some days afterwards
they complained of sickness.<a id='r2498' /><a href='#f2498' class='c013'><sup>[2498]</sup></a> The accident was ascribed to
darnel-grass. In a recent instance which happened in the workhouse
of Beninghausen, and which was traced to the lolium, seventy-four
people were attacked with giddiness, tremor, convulsions, and
vomiting. Those who had led a dissipated life suffered most, and
children least of all.<a id='r2499' /><a href='#f2499' class='c013'><sup>[2499]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Sometimes this poison appears to excite symptoms of intestinal
irritation, without acting as a narcotic. A small farmer near Poicters
in France saved five bushels of the seed from a field of wheat,—had
it ground with a single bushel of wheat, and afterwards
made bread with the mixture for his own family. He himself, with
his wife and a servant, began to eat the bread on a Thursday; but
the two last were so violently affected with vomiting and purging,
that they refused to continue taking it. He persevered himself, however,
till on the Sunday evening he became so ill that his wife wished to
send for medical aid. This he refused to allow, and next day he
expired after suffering severely from fits of colic.<a id='r2500' /><a href='#f2500' class='c013'><sup>[2500]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Bley of Bemburg has examined chemically the grain of lolium.
He obtained from it a bitter extractive matter, without any characteristic
chemical properties, but which killed a pigeon. The seed
has a very feeble bitterish taste. Bley maintains that its poisonous
properties are essential to it, and not incidental, as some think.<a id='r2501' /><a href='#f2501' class='c013'><sup>[2501]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of the Effects of certain Poisonous Leguminous Seeds.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>Among the injurious substances with which various grains are apt
to be accidentally mixed from their growing together, two leguminous
plants may be here shortly mentioned, as they have often
been the source of disagreeable accidents on the continent.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the department of the Cher and Loire in France, severe effects
have been traced to bread made partly with flour of the <i>Lathyrus cicera</i>.
M. Desparanches, in a report to the Prefect of the Department, says this
flour occasionally forms one-half of that of which bread is made in some
parishes; that it produces sometimes sudden incapability of walking,
sometimes imperfect paraplegia and pain, with a draggling gait and
turning in of the toes, and sometimes also slight convulsive movements
of the thighs and legs.<a id='r2502' /><a href='#f2502' class='c013'><sup>[2502]</sup></a> Similar effects have been traced to this substance
formerly. Virey says it has been known to produce in particular
a singular stiffness and state of semiflexion of the knee-joint,
compelling the individual to move the limbs in one rigid mass.<a id='r2503' /><a href='#f2503' class='c013'><sup>[2503]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>Ervum ervilia</i>, or Bitter-vetch, which is not a native of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_723'>723</span>country, has also been found in France to possess analogous properties.
In 1815, according to Virey, a great variety of herbs grew up
with the grain, in consequence of the wetness of the summer; and
their seeds were thus subsequently mixed with the wheat and rye.
Among these he particularizes the bitter-vetch as peculiarly noxious,
because it produces so great weakness of the extremities, but especially
of the limbs, that the individual trembles while standing, and
totters when he walks, or even requires the help of stilts; and he
adds, that horses are similarly affected, so as to become almost paralytic.<a id='r2504' /><a href='#f2504' class='c013'><sup>[2504]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>Cytisus laburnum</i>, or laburnum tree, is another plant of the
same family, which yields poisonous seeds. The whole plant is
more or less deleterious. But it is chiefly the seed that has attracted
attention hitherto.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am not acquainted with any experiments relative to the action of
the seeds on animals.—Its effects on man present considerable variety,
and show that it is a true narcotico-acrid. In some instances they
seem to have been purely narcotic. My colleague Dr. Traill has communicated
to me two cases of this nature. In one of these, that of a
child two years old, the first evident effects were sudden paleness
and a fit of screaming, followed immediately by insensibility, and
then by coldness of the whole body and lividity of the face; but
vomiting having been induced by warm water and mustard, the
seeds were discharged, the symptoms abated, and next day he was
quite well. The other case was that of a boy who was left by his
companions at Dr. Traill’s door in a state of complete insensibility,
with froth at the mouth and a feeble pulse. An emetic, administered
immediately, brought up a large quantity of laburnum seeds; after which
the pulse became firmer, and sensibility quickly returned.—Mr.
North has briefly noticed a similar case of a child, who after eating
laburnum flowers, was seized with paleness and twitches of the face,
coldness of the skin, laborious breathing, efforts to vomit, and great
feebleness of the pulse. But recovery took place after the flowers
were vomited.<a id='r2505' /><a href='#f2505' class='c013'><sup>[2505]</sup></a>—In other instances the effects have been chiefly
limited to an irritant action on the stomach and bowels. Dr. Bigsby
of Newark informs me that a few years ago a little girl in his neighbourhood,
in consequence of eating the seeds, was attacked with
violent vomiting and purging, and became in other respects very ill,
but recovered in forty-eight hours.—Most generally, however, the
effects are partly irritant, partly narcotic. In 1839 Dr. Annan of
Kinross communicated to me the case of a little boy, who in an hour
after swallowing a small quantity of unripe seeds, was attacked with
violent vomiting and ghastly expression of countenance, and then
fell into a very drowsy state, from which he was constantly roused
by shaking him and dashing cold water on his body. But for a
month afterwards he continued subject to vomiting and diarrhœa.—Mr.
Bonney of Brentford has related the particulars of eleven cases,
which presented all the varieties of poisoning with the seeds. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_724'>724</span>subjects were children from seven to nine years of age; and they
took, some of them one seed, and none more than five. Three
scarcely suffered at all. One vomited the poison and got well at
once. Of the others, some had only nausea and feebleness of the
pulse, another had also dilatation of the pupils, some had vomiting
and purging, others great drowsiness, others again both sets of symptoms.
In all the pulse was weak and generally rapid. Emetics,
laxatives and ammonia were administered with success.<a id='r2506' /><a href='#f2506' class='c013'><sup>[2506]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The leaves of this plant are stated by Vicat, a good authority, to
possess the property of acting violently as an emetic and purgative;<a id='r2507' /><a href='#f2507' class='c013'><sup>[2507]</sup></a>
and Cadet says the unripe pods have been known to produce in small
quantities severe vomiting, and profuse, protracted diarrhœa.<a id='r2508' /><a href='#f2508' class='c013'><sup>[2508]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>My attention was lately turned by a criminal trial in this country
to the effects of the bark, which is not alluded to as a poison by any
author, although its properties seem well known to the peasantry in
the north of Scotland. A lad Gordon was tried lately at Inverness for
administering poison to a fellow-servant, and it was proved that he
gave her laburnum-bark in broth. She immediately became very
sick, and was soon attacked with incessant vomiting and purging,
pain in the belly, rigor, and extreme feebleness; and several days
elapsed before she could return to her work. The sickness, vomiting,
purging and pain continued afterwards to recur more or less;
great emaciation ensued; in six weeks she was so much reduced as
to be compelled to quit service; and even six months afterwards,
she continued so ill with a chronic dysenteric affection, that fears
were entertained for her life, although eventually she did recover.
Being consulted in the case, I was inclined to rely in the general
properties of the plant and the peculiar, intense, nauseous bitterness
of the bark, even more intense there than in the seeds, as adequate
proof that the bark was capable of producing the effects observed
in this case. I was scarcely prepared, however, to find it so
deadly a narcotic poison, as it proved to be on careful experiment.
Dr. Ross of Dornoch, who saw the woman and was also consulted on
the part of the crown in the case, found that from twenty to seventy
grains of dried laburnum-bark caused speedy and violent
vomiting when administered to dogs, but no other marked effect.
I found that when an infusion of a drachm of dried bark was injected
into the stomach of a strong rabbit, the animal in two minutes
began to look quickly from side to side, as if alarmed and uncertain
in which direction to go, then twitched back its head two or three
times, and instantly fell on its side in violent tetanic convulsions,
with alternating opisthotonos and emprosthotonos so energetic that
its body bounded with great force upon the side up and down the
room. Suddenly in half a minute more all motion ceased, respiration
was at an end, and, excepting that the heart continued for a
little to contract with some force, life was extinct. No morbid appearance
was visible anywhere. The heart was gorged, but irritable.
Dr. Ross subsequently repeated this experiment, and obtained analogous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_725'>725</span>results; but the animals he operated on did not die for half an
hour or upwards.<a id='r2509' /><a href='#f2509' class='c013'><sup>[2509]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>MM. Chevallier and Lassaigne have discovered in the seeds an
active principle called cytisin, a nauseous, bitter, brownish-yellow,
neutral, uncrystallizable substance, of which small doses killed various
animals amidst vomiting and convulsions, and eight grains taken
by man in four doses brought on giddiness, violent spasms, and frequency
of the pulse, lasting for two hours, and followed by exhaustion.<a id='r2510' /><a href='#f2510' class='c013'><sup>[2510]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Alcohol.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'><i>Of its Action on Animals, and Symptoms in Man.</i>—Alcohol has
been generally believed, since the experiments of Sir B. Brodie,<a id='r2511' /><a href='#f2511' class='c013'><sup>[2511]</sup></a> to
act on the brain through the medium of the nerves, and to do so
without entering the blood. This may be doubted. At least in
some experiments performed several years ago by Dr. C. Coindet and
myself it appeared not to act so swiftly, but that absorption might
easily have taken place before its operation began. At all events,
through whatever channel it may operate, there is no doubt that it
enters the blood; for in man the breath has a strong smell of spirit
for a considerable time after it is swallowed; and it has been found
in the tissues and secretions after death from large doses. Professor
Orfila found that alcohol is a violent poison when injected into the
cellular tissue; and that it produces through that channel the same
effects as when taken into the stomach.<a id='r2512' /><a href='#f2512' class='c013'><sup>[2512]</sup></a> In the course of our experiments
Dr. C. Coindet and I found that it acted with great rapidity
when injected into the cavity of the chest.</p>

<p class='c006'>Authors who have treated of the action of alcohol and spirituous
liquors on man, have distinguished three degrees in its immediate
effects.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. When the dose is small, much excitement and little subsequent
depression are produced.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. When the effect is sufficiently great to receive the designation of
poisoning, the symptoms are more violent excitement, flushed face,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_726'>726</span>giddiness, confusion of thought, delirium, and various mental affections,
varying with individual character, and too familiar to require
description here. These symptoms are soon followed by dozing and
gradually increasing somnolency, which may at length become so
deep as not to be always easily broken. After the state of somnolency
has continued several hours, it ceases gradually, but is followed
by giddiness, weakness stupidity, headache, sickness, and vomiting.</p>

<p class='c006'>This degree of injury from alcohol may prove fatal, either in itself,
by the coma becoming deeper and deeper,—or from the previous
excited state of the circulation causing diseases of the brain in
a predisposed habit,—or more frequently from the occurrence of
some trifling accident, which in his torpid state the individual cannot
avoid or remedy, such as exposure to cold, falling with the face in
mud or water, suffocation from vomited matters getting into the
windpipe, and the like.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of simple poisoning by the gradual increase of coma the following
judicial case in which I was consulted is a characteristic example.
Two brothers drank in half an hour three bottles of porter, with
which three half-mutchkins (24 ounces) of whisky had been secretly
mixed by a companion, whose object was to fill them drunk by way
of joke. In the course of drinking both became confused. In fifteen
minutes after finishing the last bottle one of them fell down insensible,
and had no recollection of what happened for twelve hours; but he
recovered. The other staggered a considerable distance for an hour,
and then became quite insensible and unable to stand. In four
hours more consciousness and sensibility were quite extinct, the
breathing stertorous and irregular, the pulse 80 and feeble, the pupils
dilated and not contractile, and deglutition impossible. In this state
he remained without any material change till his death, which took
place in fifteen hours after he finished his debauch. A surgeon saw
him when he had been five hours ill, but did little for his relief, as
the case appeared hopeless.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is a singular variety in the principal symptoms of this form
of poisoning, even when completely formed. From a careful tabular
analysis of no fewer than twenty-six cases, chiefly of the present denomination,
collected by Dr. Ogston of Aberdeen from the experience
of the police-office there, it appears that when the stage of stupor is
fully formed, the person is sometimes capable of being roused,
sometimes immovably comatose for a long time,—that the pulse is
sometimes imperceptible or very feeble, sometimes distinct or even
full, generally slow or natural, seldom frequent, very seldom firm,—that
the pupils are occasionally contracted, much more generally
dilated, and in a few instances alternating between one state and the
other,—that the countenance is commonly pale, sometimes turgid
and flushed,—and that the breathing is for the most part slow, and
also soft, yet not unfrequently laborious, but very rarely stertorous.
Convulsions are rare, having been observed twice only, and on both
occasions in young people of the age of twelve or fourteen.<a id='r2513' /><a href='#f2513' class='c013'><sup>[2513]</sup></a> Dr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_727'>727</span>Ogston has tried to group these several symptoms together in classified
cases; but the general conclusions at which he arrives are
subject to important exceptions. Neither do any of the special
symptoms seem to bear a marked relation to the ultimate event. It
is peculiarly worthy of remark, that very many cases got well where
the pupils were much dilated, the coma profound, and the pulse imperceptible.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the present form of poisoning with alcoholic fluids, it usually
happens that if the stage of stupor be completely overcome, recovery
speedily ensues, without any particular symptom except headache,
giddiness, sickness, and the customary consequences of a debauch.
Hut on some occasions the comatose stage is succeeded by one which
indicates much cerebral excitement,—by flushed face, injected eyes,
restlessness, a febrile state of the pulse, and delirium, even of the
violent kind. In other cases this affection puts on very much the
characters of a slight attack of typhoid fever.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the second variety of the second degree of intoxication, an
apoplectic disposition is called into action by the excited state of the
circulating system; and death ensues from apoplexy or some other
disease of the brain, rather than from simple poisoning. Thus in
some instances, as will be more fully mentioned under the head of
the morbid appearances, extravasation of blood is found within the
head after death, preceded by the usual phenomena of ordinary intoxication.
Since this is a rare effect of intoxication, it must be considered
as the result of poisoning with spirits, exciting sanguineous
apoplexy in a predisposed constitution. In other cases the stupor of
intoxication, after putting on all the characters of apoplexy for two
days and upwards, terminates fatally without extravasation. Here
the poison operates by developing a constitutional tendency to congestive
apoplexy. Again, this mode of action is still more clearly
shown in some cases, where an interval of returning health occurs
between the immediate narcotic effects of the poison and the ultimate
apoplectic coma which is the occasion of death. Such a course
of events, which, however, is of rare occurrence, is well exemplified
in the following cases. A man drank 32 ounces of rum one afternoon,
and was comatose most of the ensuing night. Next morning,
though very drowsy, he was sensible when roused; and in the evening
he was considered convalescent. But two days afterwards he
became delirious; in two days more he died comatose; and congestion
was the only appearance found in the brain.<a id='r2514' /><a href='#f2514' class='c013'><sup>[2514]</sup></a> Another instance,
most remarkable in its circumstances, is the following, which
has been related by Dr. Golding Bird. A workman in a distillery,
after drinking eight ounces of rectified spirit by mistake for water,
suddenly fell down senseless and motionless, and remained so for
eleven hours. He then began to recover, and came round so far
that he returned to his work next morning. After this he continued
to pass dark, pitch-like evacuations. In three weeks he became
drowsy, mistook one thing for another, answered questions sluggishly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_728'>728</span>and had a frequent pulse, and dilated sluggish pupils; in which state
he continued three weeks later when the account was published.<a id='r2515' /><a href='#f2515' class='c013'><sup>[2515]</sup></a>
The following case, related by Dr. Chowne, also seems to belong to
the same category, although it presents anomalies. A boy, eight
years of age, soon after swallowing about eight ounces of gin, said
he felt like a drunk man, and suddenly became motionless and insensible.
In no long time he vomited a fluid of the odour of gin;
and in seven hours from the commencement a fluid was withdrawn
from the stomach, possessing no longer any such odour. He was
now motionless, insensible, pale, and cold; the pupils were contracted,
the pulse feeble and hurried, the breathing stertorous and
slow; and he made ineffectual efforts to vomit. Stimulants of all
kind had little effect on him for a day and a half, when the breathing
became more natural, and his look quite intelligent. Yet he could
not answer questions, exhibited no sign of volition, and had a pulse
so frequent as 160. In twenty-four hours more the breathing became
laborious and rattling, and the lips livid; and death took
place near the close of the third day. The only appearances of any
note in the dead body were general injection of the arachnoid membrane
of the brain, and effusion of frothy mucus into the bronchial
ramifications.<a id='r2516' /><a href='#f2516' class='c013'><sup>[2516]</sup></a> Similar to these is the following extraordinary case
which has been communicated to me by Dr. Traill. A boy seven
years of age, who was persuaded by two miscreants to take nearly
five ounces of undiluted whisky, suffered for two days from the ordinary
symptoms of excessive intoxication, which were then immediately
followed by epileptic convulsions. These continued to recur
with more or less violence, but always frequently, for two months
down to the date of the judicial investigation to which the case gave
rise. All these forms of the effects of drinking ardent spirits can
scarcely be considered as simple poisoning, but as the result of poisoning
developing a tendency to diseases of the head.</p>

<p class='c006'>The third variety of poisoning with spirits in the second degree
proves fatal, not in itself, but by some trivial accident happening,
from which the individual cannot escape on account of his powerless
insensibility. Thus, it is no uncommon thing for persons in a state
of deep intoxication to fall down in an exposed place, where they
perish from cold, or to tumble with the face in a puddle, and so be
suffocated, or to be choked by inhaling the contents of the stomach
imperfectly vomited, or by lying in such a posture that their neck-cloth
produces strangulation. These statements are so familiar, that
it is unnecessary to illustrate them by special facts. The reader’s
attention was called to such accidents in the previous editions of
this work. Two well-marked cases of the kind have been since
published by Mr. Skae.<a id='r2517' /><a href='#f2517' class='c013'><sup>[2517]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In cases of simple poisoning in the second degree the progress of
the symptoms is on the whole remarkably uniform, gradual and
uninterrupted. But there are likewise some anomalies which it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_729'>729</span>may be well to notice. Thus, occasionally after the phenomena of
ordinary intoxication have gone on gradually increasing without
having attained a very great height, sudden lethargy supervenes at
once, and may prove fatal with singular rapidity. My colleague, Dr.
Alison, has communicated to me the particulars of a case of the kind
where death took place from simple intoxication, twenty minutes
after the state of lethargy began. The individual reached his home
in a state of reeling drunkenness, but able to speak and give an indistinct
account of himself. He then became lethargic, and died in
the course of twenty minutes. On examining the body, Dr. Alison
could not discover any morbid appearance, except some watery effusion
on the surface of the brain and in the ventricles; but the contents
of the stomach had a strong smell of spirits. Instances of such
excessive rapidity, however, are rare, unless from the third form of
poisoning.—An anomaly of a different kind, of which a remarkable
example was brought judicially under my notice, is sudden supervention
of deep insurmountable stupor, without the usual precursory
symptoms, yet not till after a considerable interval subsequently to
drinking. In May, 1830, a lad of sixteen, in consequence of a bet
with a spirit-dealer, swallowed sixteen ounces of whisky in the course
of ten minutes, and, pursuant to the terms of the wager, walked up
and down the room for half an hour. He then went into the open
air, apparently not at all the worse for his feat; but in a very few
minutes, while in the act of putting his hand into his pocket to take
out some money, he became so suddenly senseless as to forget to
withdraw his hand, and so insensible that his companions could
not rouse him. A surgeon, who was immediately procured, contented
himself with giving several clysters and a dose of tartar-emetic,
which did not operate; and the young man died in the
course of sixteen hours. The cause of the retardation of the symptoms
was partly perhaps that he had taken supper only an hour before
drinking the spirits, but chiefly, I presume, because the stupor
was kept off for a time by the stimulus of determination to win his
bet.—Several cases somewhat similar have been described by Dr.
Ogston. In these sudden insensibility came on while the individuals
had been drinking freely for some time, without showing any
marked sign of approaching intoxication.<a id='r2518' /><a href='#f2518' class='c013'><sup>[2518]</sup></a> The cause of the postponement
and sudden invasion of the stupor does not exactly appear;
but a familiar cause of its abrupt invasion in ordinary cases of
drunkenness is sudden exposure to cold.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is impossible to fix the extremes of duration of the present form
of poisoning in fatal cases. For, on the one hand, one or other of
the accidents mentioned above may bring the case to a speedy close;
and, on the other hand, the supervention of apoplexy may protract it
to several days. The ordinary duration in fatal cases seems to be
from twelve to eighteen hours.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. The third degree of poisoning is not so often witnessed, because,
in order to produce it, a greater quantity of spirits must be swallowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_730'>730</span>pure and at once, than is usually taken by those among whom poisoning
in the second degree chiefly occurs. When swallowed in
large quantity, as by persons who have taken foolish wagers on their
prowess in drinking, there is seldom much preliminary excitement;
coma approaches in a few minutes and soon becomes profound,
as in apoplexy. The face is then sometimes livid, more
generally ghastly pale; the breathing stertorous, and of a spirituous
odour; the pupils sometimes much contracted, more commonly
dilated and insensible; and if relief is not speedily procured, death
takes place,—generally in a few hours, and sometimes immediately.
According to Mr. Bedingfield, who witnessed many cases of poisoning
with rum at Liverpool, which always follow the arrival of the
West India vessels, the patient will recover if the iris remains contractile;
but if it is dilated and motionless on the approach of a light,
recovery is very improbable.<a id='r2519' /><a href='#f2519' class='c013'><sup>[2519]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>A case is briefly alluded to by Orfila of a soldier, who drank eight
pints of brandy for a wager, and died instantly.<a id='r2520' /><a href='#f2520' class='c013'><sup>[2520]</sup></a> A case of the
same kind is quoted by Professor Marx.<a id='r2521' /><a href='#f2521' class='c013'><sup>[2521]</sup></a> Another, which happened
in the person of a London cabman, is noticed in a French Journal.
The man, for a bribe of five shillings, drank at a draught a
whole bottle of gin; and in a few minutes he dropped down dead.<a id='r2522' /><a href='#f2522' class='c013'><sup>[2522]</sup></a>
Similar accidents occur not infrequently in this country; but I have
not met with any fully described by authors. A case of the less
rapid variety of the present form occurred at the Infirmary here in
1820. A man stole a bottle of whiskey; and, being in danger of
detection, took what he thought the surest way of concealing it, by
drinking it all. He died in four hours with symptoms of pure coma.</p>

<p class='c006'>Convulsions are not common in such cases. I have seen a remarkable
example, however, in which the coma was accompanied
with constant alternating <i>opisthotonos</i> and <i>emprosthotonos</i>. The subject
was a boy who had been induced to drink raw whisky by an
acquaintance, and had been two hours insensible before I saw him.
The stomach-pump, which was immediately applied, brought away
a large quantity of fluid with a strong spirituous odour; and he recovered
his senses in fifteen minutes, but remained very drowsy for
the rest of the day.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such are the forms of poisoning with spirits usually admitted by
authors. But it also appears to act sometimes as an irritant. After
its ordinary narcotic action passes off, another set of symptoms occasionally
appear, which indicate inflammation of the alimentary canal.
Cases of this kind are exceedingly rare; yet they have been met
with, as the following extract shows. “A young man at Paris had
been drinking brandy immoderately for several successive days,
when at length he was attacked with shivering, nausea, feverishness,
pain in the stomach, vomiting of everything he swallowed except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_731'>731</span>cold water, thirst, and at last hiccup, delirium, jaundice, and convulsions;
and death took place on the ninth day. On examining
the body the stomach was found gangrenous over the whole villous
coat; the colon too was much inflamed; and all the small intestines
were red.”<a id='r2523' /><a href='#f2523' class='c013'><sup>[2523]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>A case of great complexity, but probably of the same nature, has
been related by Opitz in Pyl’s Memoirs. The subject was a woman
liable to epilepsy, and addicted to excessive drinking. After one of
her drinking-bouts she was seized with vomiting and severe pain of
the bowels, afterwards with delirium, then with convulsions, and
she died in twenty-four hours after the first attack. The stomach
and intestines were greatly inflamed, a table-spoonful of blood was
effused into the ventricles of the brain, and the left lung was purulent.<a id='r2524' /><a href='#f2524' class='c013'><sup>[2524]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Besides the immediately fatal effects of spirituous liquors now described,
there is still another variety of poisoning more common than
any yet mentioned, and constituting a peculiar disease. People who
fall into the unhappy vice of habitual intoxication, after remaining in
a state of drunkenness for several days together, are often attacked
with a singular maniacal affection, which is accompanied with tremors,
particularly of the hands, and after enduring for several days,
ends at last in coma. When the delirium is not so violent, the disease
by proper treatment may be cured. But frequently, after the delirium
and tremor have continued mildly for some time, they increase,
and the delirium becomes furious, or coma rapidly supervenes; in
either of which cases the disorder commonly proves fatal in two or
three days more. This disease, which is now familiar to the physician,
is called <i>delirium tremens</i>. It is supposed by some to depend
on inflammation of the membranes of the brain, followed by effusion.</p>

<p class='c006'>Other diseases, besides <i>delirium tremens</i>, are also slowly induced
by the habitual and excessive use of spirituous liquors; but in general
the habit of intoxication acts in inducing these diseases only as a
predisposing cause. A particular variety of tuberculated liver probably
arises from the habitual use of spirits without the co-operation
of other causes. That variety of disease of the kidney, which was
first brought under the notice of the profession by Dr. Bright,<a id='r2525' /><a href='#f2525' class='c013'><sup>[2525]</sup></a> is also
obviously often connected with the habit of drinking spirits. The
following have been enumerated among the diseases where the same
habit acts powerfully as a predisposing cause—indurated pancreas,—indurated
mesenteric glands,—scirrhous pylorus,—catarrh of the
bladder,—inflammation, suppuration and induration of the kidneys,—incontinence
of urine,—aneurism of the heart and great vessels,—apoplexy
of the lungs,—varicose veins,—mania,—epilepsy,—tendency
to gangrene of wounds,—spontaneous combustion.<a id='r2526' /><a href='#f2526' class='c013'><sup>[2526]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of the Morbid Appearances.</i>—Some doubts exist as to the morbid
appearances in the bodies of those poisoned by spirituous liquors.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_732'>732</span>In animals killed by alcohol, Orfila says he found the villous coat
of the stomach constantly of a cherry-red odour. I have several times
remarked the same appearance. When the stomach was empty before
the alcohol was introduced, I have always found the prominent
part of its rugæ of a deep cherry-red tint, the margin of the patches
being more florid, and evidently consisting of a minute network
of vessels.</p>

<p class='c006'>In man these signs of irritation have not been always observed.
In the patient who died in the Infirmary here, the stomach was quite
natural to appearance. Dr. Ogston notices injection of the small intestines
and thickening of the mucous membrane of the stomach and
intestines as common appearances in the cases he has examined; but
he seems to consider these the effects not of the last fatal dose, but of
the habit of frequent excessive drinking.<a id='r2527' /><a href='#f2527' class='c013'><sup>[2527]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The blood in the heart and great vessels is commonly fluid and
very dark, and the lungs are sometimes more or less gorged with the
same fluid.</p>

<p class='c006'>The state of the brain differs much according to the mode of death.
Sometimes great congestion and even actual extravasation of blood
are found in the heads of persons who have died of excessive continuous
drinking,—the excitement of such a debauch being apt, as
already mentioned, to induce apoplexy in a predisposed habit. Accordingly
extravasation was found by Professor Bernt of Vienna in
no less than four cases of the kind, two of which happened in the
persons of young men not above twenty-two years of age;<a id='r2528' /><a href='#f2528' class='c013'><sup>[2528]</sup></a> and Dr.
Cooke quotes another in his work on nervous diseases.<a id='r2529' /><a href='#f2529' class='c013'><sup>[2529]</sup></a> I have myself
met with another remarkable instance. A female out-pensioner
of Trinity Hospital here, who was much addicted to drinking, and
for fourteen days after the New-year of 1830 had been very little in
her sober senses, soon after arriving at home one evening much intoxicated,
fell down comatose, and died in ten or twelve hours. An
enormous extravasation of clotted blood was found in the ventricles,
producing extensive laceration of the right middle and anterior lobes
of the brain.—In such cases it is natural to suppose that a predisposition
to apoplexy must concur with the intoxication; otherwise it
is not easy to see why death from extravasation is not more frequently
produced by excessive drinking.</p>

<p class='c006'>Extravasation is not apt to occur in the cases of rapid death
brought on by a very large quantity swallowed at once. The circulation,
indeed, is during life in a state quite the reverse of excitement;
and accordingly the brain and its membranes are found quite healthy.
They were particularly so in the man who died in the hospital
here. It is right to mention, however, that one of Bernt’s cases, although
the symptoms and other particulars are not mentioned, possibly
belongs to the present variety, as the man swallowed for a
wager a quart of brandy at a draught.<a id='r2530' /><a href='#f2530' class='c013'><sup>[2530]</sup></a> According to Dr. Ogston,
who has given the best account of the appearances within the head
<span class='pageno' id='Page_733'>733</span>in the ordinary cases of this kind, there is usually serous effusion
under the arachnoid membrane, occasionally minute injection of vessels,
commonly more or less general gorging of the larger veins,
and especially effusion of serosity to the amount of two or even four
ounces in the ventricles.<a id='r2531' /><a href='#f2531' class='c013'><sup>[2531]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>When delirium tremens proves fatal, effusion is commonly found
among the membranes of the brain; and occasionally to a great extent.
In one instance, which proved fatal in two or three days, I
have seen minute vascularity of the membranes, with effusion of fibrin,
and without effusion of serosity; but such cases are rare. There is
also, according to Andral, very extensive softening of the mucous coat
of the stomach.<a id='r2532' /><a href='#f2532' class='c013'><sup>[2532]</sup></a> In an instance mentioned in Rust’s Journal, besides
effusion into the cerebral membranes, there was found an enormous
accumulation of fat in all the cavities, a conversion of the muscular
substance into fat, and a nauseous sweet smell from the whole body.<a id='r2533' /><a href='#f2533' class='c013'><sup>[2533]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In all cases of rapid poisoning with spirituous liquors some of the
poison will be found in the stomach. For when the case is one of
pure narcotic poisoning, unaided by the effects of blows, exposure
to cold, or the like, and the person dies in a few hours, the poison
cannot be all absorbed before death.—Although the spirituous
liquors used in Britain have all very powerful odours, the inspector
in a case of importance ought not to confine himself to this test alone.
He must subject the suspected matter to distillation; and then remove
the water from what distils over by repeated agitation with dry carbonate
of potass, till he procures the alcohol of the spirit in such a
state of purity as to be inflammable.</p>

<p class='c006'>Alcohol may also be in some circumstances detected in the tissues
and secretions of the body. A spirituous odour has been remarked
not infrequently in various parts, and especially in the brain. Dr.
Cooke mentions a case in which the fluid in the ventricles of the
brain had the smell and taste of gin, the liquor which had been
taken;<a id='r2534' /><a href='#f2534' class='c013'><sup>[2534]</sup></a> Dr. Ogston adverts to an instance, in which after death by
drowning during intoxication, he found in the ventricles nearly four
ounces of fluid, having a strong odour of whisky;<a id='r2535' /><a href='#f2535' class='c013'><sup>[2535]</sup></a> in the case which
occurred in the hospital here the odour of whisky was said to have
been perceived in the pericardium; and in a man who died of long-continued
intoxication from immoderate drinking Dr. Wolffe found
that the surface, and still more the ventricles, of the brain had a
strong smell of brandy, although the contents of the stomach had
not.<a id='r2536' /><a href='#f2536' class='c013'><sup>[2536]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The presumption afforded by such facts as these, in favour of the
absorption of alcohol and the possibility of detecting it throughout
the animal system, has been turned to certainty by the late experimental
researches of Dr. Percy; who found that in animals poisoned with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_734'>734</span>alcoholic fluids, as well as in the case of a man who died during the
night after drinking a bottle of rum, alcohol could be detected, generally
in the urine, and also in the brain, by cautious distillation,
and removing the water from the distilled fluid by means of dry carbonate
of potass.<a id='r2537' /><a href='#f2537' class='c013'><sup>[2537]</sup></a> Dr. Percy gave me an opportunity of verifying
his results with the brain of the man; and I had no difficulty in obtaining
from a few ounces of brain a sufficiency of spirit to exhibit its
combustion on asbestus repeatedly.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is hardly necessary to add, that when the individual has survived
the taking of the poison a considerable length of time, an
odour of spirits will not be perceived either in the stomach or elsewhere.
In the out-pensioner of Trinity Hospital, for example, who
survived about twelve hours, no spirituous odour could any where
be perceived. In such cases the poison disappears during life by
absorption.—A question may even be entertained, whether the
odour may not sometimes be imperceptible at the inspection of the
body, although the poison was really present immediately after death.
It is probable that, as in the instance of hydrocyanic acid, the alcohol,
on account of its volatility or fluidity, will evaporate or percolate
away in a few days. In this manner only can be explained
the occasional absence of the odour in persons who have been killed
in the early stage of drunkenness. I could not perceive any odour
of whisky in the stomach of the woman Campbell, who was murdered
by the notorious resurrectionist Burke, although she had drunk
spirits to intoxication half an hour before her death. The body was
not examined till thirty-eight hours after.<a id='r2538' /><a href='#f2538' class='c013'><sup>[2538]</sup></a> It must be observed,
however, that alcohol may exist in the contents of the stomach and
be detected by chemical analysis, although it is not indicated by its
odour. I have twice had occasion to observe this, where the bodies
were disinterred some time after death.</p>

<p class='c006'>From all that has been said, there ought seldom to be much difficulty
in recognizing a case of poisoning with spirituous liquors.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, before quitting the subject, a form of it must be noticed which
may be extremely difficult to distinguish. It was formerly remarked
that the eatable mushrooms have been sometimes poisoned with substances
possessing effects on the system analogous to those caused by
the deleterious fungi. In the same manner spirituous liquors may be
poisoned with narcotics allied to them in action. Thus, in former
parts of this work, it has been stated that a young man was killed
during a debauch in consequence of his companions having mingled
opium with his wine; that many persons have been poisoned and
some killed by fermented liquors drugged in the same manner; that
murder has been accomplished by poisoning wine with nightshade;
and that several fatal accidents have occurred in consequence of
liqueurs having been too strongly impregnated with hydrocyanic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_735'>735</span>acid, to give them a ratafia flavour. Cases of this nature may be
embarrassing. In general, they may be made out by attending
strictly to the symptoms, the quantity of liquor taken, and the contents
of the stomach. But, it must be admitted, that if a murderer,
who chooses such a method, should season his guest’s drink judiciously,
and ply him well with it, a medical jurist might be puzzled to
determine whether the liquor was to blame in point of quality or
quantity.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Of the Treatment.</i>—The treatment of poisoning with alcoholic
fluids does not differ essentially from that of poisoning with opium.
In the former, as in the latter, the chief objects must be to remove
the poison from the stomach, and to rouse the patient from his state
of stupor; but in poisoning with alcoholic fluids it is also frequently
necessary to treat a secondary stage of reaction by local and even
general antiphlogistic measures. As to the primary object, the removal
of the poison from the stomach, it appears that in the present
form of poisoning emetics are more seldom effectual than in the case
of other narcotics, and that the stomach-pump should be promptly
resorted to. It is remarkable that the operation of clearing out the
stomach is likewise often a sufficient stimulus to dispel stupor immediately
and even permanently. I have seen almost complete consciousness
permanently restored with the discharge of the alcoholic
fluid; and the same remark has been made by others. Where the
senses are not thus restored, one of the most effectual stimulants, according
to the practice of the police-office of this city, is the injection
of water into the ears. Great advantage has been derived, as in
poisoning with opium, from the cold affusion applied to the head.
Dr. Ogston, who has appended to his paper formerly quoted a very
useful summary of the treatment of poisoning with spirits, has found
this a safe and effectual remedy where the heat of the head was unnaturally
great and that of the body not too low.<a id='r2539' /><a href='#f2539' class='c013'><sup>[2539]</sup></a> Cases have been
published where it proved successful although the pulse was gone
at the wrist, the breathing scarcely perceptible, and the temperature
of the whole body greatly reduced.<a id='r2540' /><a href='#f2540' class='c013'><sup>[2540]</sup></a> It is doubtless a powerful remedy:
but where the general temperature of the surface is much
lowered, I conceive it should be restricted to the head and neck, and
conjoined with the application of warmth to the body. Dr. Ogston
objects to the general use of blood-letting in cases of poisoning with
spirits, as being often apt to be followed by sudden sinking. Where
other remedies are judiciously used, it is probably seldom called for;
and the purpose it is intended to serve, namely, the relief of cerebral
congestion and determination, is better fulfilled by the local employment
of cold, and local blood-letting. Ammonia and its acetate have
been found useful as internal stimulants where the stupor is deep.
The treatment of the secondary affections adverted to above does not
require specific mention.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_736'>736</span>
  <h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with Sulphuric and Nitric Ether.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Sulphuric ether and nitric ether are poisons of the same nature
with alcohol. But the effects produced by them when taken in considerable
doses are not very well known.</p>

<p class='c006'>Orfila found that half an ounce of sulphuric ether introduced into
the stomach of a dog and secured there by a ligature on the gullet,
excited efforts to vomit, in ten minutes inability to stand, and in
six minutes more, insensibility. In fifteen minutes more the animal
revived a little, but soon became again comatose; and it died in
three hours after the commencement of the experiment. The villous
coat of the stomach was reddish-black, the other coats of a lively red
colour.<a id='r2541' /><a href='#f2541' class='c013'><sup>[2541]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The effects of the ethers on man have not been accurately ascertained.
From some observations published in the Journal of Science,
sulphuric ether appears to act energetically even in small doses. In
moderate quantity it produces a strong sense of irritation in the throat,
a feeling of fulness in the head, and other symptoms like those excited
by nitrous-oxide gas. A gentleman, in consequence of inhaling
it too long, was attacked with intermitting lethargy for thirty-six
hours, depression of spirits and lowness of pulse.<a id='r2542' /><a href='#f2542' class='c013'><sup>[2542]</sup></a> When long and
habitually used, as by persons afflicted with asthma, its dose must be
gradually increased; and it appears that considerable quantities
may then be taken for a great length of time without material injury.
I have been informed of an instance of an asthmatic gentleman about
sixty years of age who consumed sixteen ounces every eight or ten
days, and had been in the habit of doing so for many years. Yet,
with the exception of his asthma, he enjoyed tolerable health.</p>

<p class='c006'>An interesting case has been published which proves that nitric
ether in vapour is a dangerous poison when too freely and too long
inhaled. A druggist’s maid-servant was found one morning dead in
bed, and death had evidently arisen from the air of her apartment
having been accidentally loaded with vapour of nitric ether, from
the breaking of a three-gallon jar of the <i>spiritus etheris nitrici</i>.
She was found lying on her side, with her arms folded across the
chest, the countenance and posture composed, and the whole appearance
like a person in deep sleep. The stomach was red internally,
and the lungs were gorged.<a id='r2543' /><a href='#f2543' class='c013'><sup>[2543]</sup></a> The editor of the journal, where
this case is related, says he is acquainted with a similar instance
where a young man became completely insensible from breathing air
loaded with sulphuric ether, remained apoplectic for some hours, and
would undoubtedly have perished had he not been discovered and
removed in time.</p>

<h4 class='c014'><i>Of Poisoning with the Oleaginous products of Combustion.</i></h4>

<p class='c012'>The physiological effects of these substances have not yet been
extensively investigated. It has been already mentioned, that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_737'>737</span>empyreumatic oils of tobacco and other narcotic vegetables are active
poisons; and that the emanations from candle snuffings and imperfectly
consumed tallow probably owe their injurious properties to a
peculiar oil. Many empyreumatic oils are known, and some are
used in medicine, which act powerfully on the animal system as stimulants
and antispasmodics. Among these may be enumerated
naphtha, oil of galbanum, oil of guiaiac, oil of amber, oil of wax,
and Dippel’s oil. The last in particular, which is the rectified empyreumatic
oil of hartshorn, but is prepared also from blood and various
animal matters,<a id='r2544' /><a href='#f2544' class='c013'><sup>[2544]</sup></a> has been a good deal used of late on the continent
for medical purposes, and has even been resorted to as a poison
for the purpose of self-destruction.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only one of these substances whose physiological properties
have been examined with particular care, is the empyreumatic oil
procured by the destructive distillation of lard. When freed of adhering
acid by rectification from quicklime, this oil is limpid and
very volatile, has an insupportable smell, and when diffused in the
air, irritates the eyes and nostrils, and even excites giddiness. Buchner
found it to possess simple narcotic properties. When a mouse
was confined under a jar, into which a little of its vapour was introduced,
it suddenly tried to escape, immediately fell down exhausted,
and, although soon afterwards removed into the open air, expired in
about fifteen minutes, without convulsions. It is much less powerful
when introduced into the stomach, yet is still a dangerous poison
through that channel; for five drops projected into the throat of a
chaffinch very nearly proved fatal; and the only symptoms were excessive
exhaustion, slow respiration, and insensibility.<a id='r2545' /><a href='#f2545' class='c013'><sup>[2545]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Similar effects have been occasionally observed in man. The late
Professor Chaussier has related a case of poisoning in the human
subject from the <i>oil of Dippel</i>, or rectified empyreumatic oil of hartshorn.
It is merely mentioned, however, that the individual, on
taking a spoonful by mistake, died immediately; and that no morbid
appearance could be discovered in the dead body.<a id='r2546' /><a href='#f2546' class='c013'><sup>[2546]</sup></a> Another case
has been more recently related, where the poison was the impure oil
of commerce, from which the oil of Dippel is prepared by rectification.
The subject was a woman, who took it intentionally in the
dose of an ounce and a half. The symptoms induced could not be
ascertained; but it appeared, that she had been attacked with vomiting,
and, finding the action of the poison either less speedy, or less
supportable than she expected, had thrown herself into a well and
been drowned. The appearances in the body clearly showed that
in this instance the poison had not acted as a pure narcotic. The
whole body exhaled the peculiar fetid odour of the oil. The palate,
tongue, throat, and gullet, were white and shrivelled. The stomach
had outwardly a diffuse rose tint, crossed by gorged black veins,
which here and there had burst and formed patches of extravasation.
The contents of the stomach consisted of remains of food, a good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_738'>738</span>deal of the oil, some water, and likewise some extravasated blood.
Its villous coat was thick, covered with red points, corrugated into
prominent rugæ, but not eroded. The intestines also presented signs
of irritation, but in an inferior degree.<a id='r2547' /><a href='#f2547' class='c013'><sup>[2547]</sup></a> Dr. Kurtze, a German author,
mentions that the impure oil [Oleum Animale Fœtidum] was given
with malicious intention in repeated doses to an infant eighteen days
old, whom he attended, and that it caused crying and vomiting; and
he quotes Froriep’s Notizen, for the case of a woman of thirty, who
swallowed nearly two ounces, and, after repeated attacks of vomiting,
threw herself into a well and was drowned.<a id='r2548' /><a href='#f2548' class='c013'><sup>[2548]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>These facts seem to establish sufficiently the propriety of arranging
the empyreumatic oils among the narcotico-acrids.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Oil of turpentine</i> possesses somewhat similar properties; but is
much less active. It was found by Professor Schubarth, that two
drachms of this oil administered to a dog produced immediate staggering,
cries, tetanus, failure of the pulse and breathing, and death
in three minutes; and in the dead body he remarked flaccidity of
the heart, gorging of the lungs, and redness of the stomach.<a id='r2549' /><a href='#f2549' class='c013'><sup>[2549]</sup></a> It is
likewise well known to be a powerful poison for vermin, such as
lice, fleas, and worms.—On man its effects are capricious. It is
frequently used along with other laxatives against obstinate constipation
of the bowels, and either in the same manner or alone as a
remedy for intestinal worms. For these purposes it has been at times
administered in very large doses, for example in the quantity of two,
three, or four ounces, without any other effect than brisk purging.
But on the other hand it has sometimes, in much inferior
doses, induced violent hypercatharsis, or acted severely on the
urinary organs, producing strangury and bloody micturition, or affected
the brain, producing a state like intoxication, followed by
trance for many hours.<a id='r2550' /><a href='#f2550' class='c013'><sup>[2550]</sup></a> I am not aware that it has ever proved
fatal.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Oil of tar</i>, a composite substance obtained by the distillation of
wood-tar, is another pyrogenous fluid of poisonous properties. Messrs.
Slight of Portsmouth have related the case of a seaman, who, after
taking nearly four ounces by mistake for spirits, was attacked with
frequent vomiting of a matter having a strong odour of tar, attended
with excessive pain in the bowels and loins. Nothing was done for
his relief till about seven hours afterwards, when he was freely bled
and purged, with immediate relief; and next morning he was so
better as to be able to resume his work. The urine had a strong tarry
odour, and for some time he suffered from heat in passing it.<a id='r2551' /><a href='#f2551' class='c013'><sup>[2551]</sup></a> A case
occurred in the London Hospital, in which the symptoms were very
different. A lad of eighteen, while intoxicated, took two or three
draughts of oil of tar, although aware of its being poisonous. Not
long afterwards he became insensible, and had laborious, rattling respiration,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_739'>739</span>coldness of the extremities, suffusion of the conjunctiva,
contraction of the pupils, and an exceedingly feeble pulse. The
stomach-pump brought away a liquid with an overpowering smell of
tar. Stimulants, external as well as internal, venesection, and turpentine
clysters were of little avail; the insensibility continued, with only
a short and imperfect interval; and he died about twenty-four hours
after swallowing the poison. The pulmonary mucous membrane was
highly injected, the lungs gorged with blood and of a tarry odour,
the stomach and intestines natural, except that the whole <i>valvulæ conniventes</i>
were yellow,—the brain and its membranes also natural.<a id='r2552' /><a href='#f2552' class='c013'><sup>[2552]</sup></a> It is
mentioned in the paper of Messrs. Slight that a gentleman at Brighton
died in consequence of a druggist using oil of tar by mistake for
something else in making up a prescription.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Creasote</i> is another pyrogenous substance possessing considerable
activity as a poison. It is now extensively used in small doses as a
medicine for a variety of purposes.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been made the subject of physiological experiment by various
inquirers, and especially by Dr. Cormach; who found that doses
of twenty-five or forty drops caused death in a few seconds when injected
into the jugular vein of a dog, by arresting the heart’s action,
and without visibly altering the condition of the blood; that a quantity
somewhat larger caused only sopor and spasmodic twitches of
the muscles, if injected into the carotid artery, and without proving
fatal; that thirty drops introduced into the stomach of a rabbit excited
convulsions, acute cries, and death in one minute, apparently
from arrestment of the action of the heart; and that the same dose
given to a dog brought on salivation, giddiness, tetanic spasm, a
feeble, fluttering, almost imperceptible pulse, and general insensibility,
with dilated immovable pupils; but recovery took place under
the employment of blood-letting.<a id='r2553' /><a href='#f2553' class='c013'><sup>[2553]</sup></a>—The effects of too large a medicinal
dose in man are pain in the stomach and vomiting, and also,
according to Dr. Elliotson, giddiness, headache, and stupor.<a id='r2554' /><a href='#f2554' class='c013'><sup>[2554]</sup></a> Dr.
Pereira alludes to a case, mentioned in the Times newspaper, of
death caused in 36 hours by two drachms taken at once; and in this
instance acute pain in the abdomen was a prominent symptom.<a id='r2555' /><a href='#f2555' class='c013'><sup>[2555]</sup></a> I
presume this is the same case which is mentioned in the Edinburgh
Medical and Surgical Journal as having occurred at Liverpool.<a id='r2556' /><a href='#f2556' class='c013'><sup>[2556]</sup></a>—The
results of Dr. Cormack’s experiments on animals lead to the
conclusion, that in poisoning with creasote, this substance may always
be detected in the body, if it has not been removed by artificial
means a considerable time before death.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_740'>740</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XLII.<br /> <span class='small'>OF COMPOUND POISONING.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Having now investigated the three great classes of poisons in their
relations to physiology, practice of physic, and medical jurisprudence,
it will be necessary to offer a few observations on a subject
of considerable medico-legal importance, which has been almost
overlooked in systems of Toxicology,—Compound Poisoning.</p>

<p class='c006'>When two poisons of different or opposite properties are administered
about the same time in poisonous doses, the effects of the one
may overpower and prevent the operation of the other, or they may
merely modify the action of one another. In this manner the usual
symptoms produced by one or by both may be entirely or in a great
measure wanting; and even in the dead body the usual appearances
occasioned by one or both may be modified or perhaps altogether
absent.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although in the course of reading I have met with a sufficient
number of cases of the kind to show that compound poisoning is an
object of some consequence to the medical jurist, the facts hitherto
made public are not so numerous as to render a systematic arrangement
of them practicable. The most advisable course, therefore,
seems to be merely to describe for the present the cases which have
been brought under my notice. These are as follows:</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <i>Poisoning with Arsenic and Alcohol.</i>—A man, after taking
twelve ounces of whisky at a debauch, swallowed, an hour afterwards,
while in a state of excitement, but not particularly drunk, a
quantity of arsenic, the dose of which could not be ascertained.
Fifteen minutes after the arsenic was taken medical aid was procured,
upon which repeated attempts were made to produce vomiting by
means of ipecacuan and sulphate of zinc, but to no purpose. The
stomach-pump was therefore resorted to; and, after at least an hour
had been spent in previous attempts by emetics, the stomach was
cleared of a fluid in which arsenic was unequivocally detected. No
symptom of poisoning with arsenic followed. As the man took the
arsenic seven hours after a meal, when of course the powder would
at once be brought freely in contact with the villous coat of the stomach,
it must, I think, be inferred, that the operation of the arsenic
was impeded or prevented by the narcotism previously induced by
the ardent spirits. For this case I am indebted to a former pupil,
Mr. King.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Poisoning with Arsenic and Alcohol.</i>—A case of the same description
with the last, but which proved fatal in consequence of the
large quantity of arsenic taken, has been related by Dr. Wood of
Dumfries. A lad of seventeen, after a night’s debauch, swallowed
half an ounce of arsenic early in the morning. In two hours and a
half, when Dr. Wood first saw him, there was no symptom of poisoning
with arsenic,—no symptom at all indeed but languor and drowsiness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_741'>741</span>A few minutes afterwards he had slight vomiting, which
was repeatedly renewed by artificial means. For some hours the
pulse was but little elevated. In eighteen hours he began to sink,
and presented the usual constitutional symptoms of poisoning with
arsenic; and in forty-one hours he expired. But from first to last he
had scarcely any local symptom except vomiting, even although the
stomach presented after death signs of violent irritation.<a id='r2557' /><a href='#f2557' class='c013'><sup>[2557]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>3. <i>Poisoning with Tartar-Emetic and Charcoal Fumes.</i>—Under the
head of poisoning with antimony, notice has already been taken of
the case of a man who, after swallowing seventeen grains of tartar-emetic,
attempted to commit suicide by suffocating himself with the
fumes of burning charcoal. He recovered from both attempts, suffered
severely from the usual narcotic effects of carbonic acid gas,
but showed scarcely any symptom of the irritant action of tartar-emetic.<a id='r2558' /><a href='#f2558' class='c013'><sup>[2558]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>4. <i>Poisoning with Alcohol and with Laudanum.</i>—Under the head
of poisoning with opium, allusion has already been made to a remarkable
case related by Mr. Shearman, where the usual effects of
opium were much retarded in an individual who, at the time of swallowing
the opium, was in a state of excitement from intoxication. For five
hours there was no material stupor. But after that the usual narcotic
symptoms supervened and eventually proved fatal.<a id='r2559' /><a href='#f2559' class='c013'><sup>[2559]</sup></a> The excitement
of intoxication, however, has not always the effect of suspending the
action of opium; for in a case which came under my notice in the
Infirmary of this city,—that of a woman, who swallowed an ounce
and a half of laudanum while much intoxicated,—the usual narcotic
symptoms were fully formed in an hour: and although the stomach-pump
was applied soon afterwards, she expired in less than five hours
from the time the laudanum was swallowed,—those who had charge
of her before she was brought into the hospital having neglected to
use the proper means for keeping her roused.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. <i>Poisoning with Laudanum and Corrosive Sublimate.</i>—Of all the
cases of compound poisoning I have met with, the most remarkable
is an instance which occurred in Edinburgh Castle, a few years ago,
of poisoning with laudanum and corrosive sublimate. In this case,
the individual, a young soldier, swallowed about the same time two
drachms of the latter and half an ounce of the former. He had at
first no violent symptoms whatever, indicating the operation of corrosive
sublimate; which is an extremely rare occurrence. Afterwards
he had frequent purging and tenesmus, with bloody stools and
all the usual phenomena of violent dysentery, but no pain of belly,
no tenderness even on firm pressure, no vomiting except under the
use of emetics. On the fourth day a violent salivation set in; and
under this and the dysenteric affection he became quickly exhausted,
yet not so much, but that on the day of his death, the ninth after he
took the poison, he was able to walk a little in his room without assistance.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_742'>742</span>He died on the close-stool rather unexpectedly. I have
unfortunately lost the original notes I had of this case, and have forgotten
whether any narcotic symptoms were present at first; but my
impression is that they were present, though in a slight degree only.
Most of the previous particulars were communicated to me by the
late Dr. Mackintosh. The stomach, duodenum, ileum, colon, and
rectum were found after death enormously inflamed, ulcerated, and
here and there almost gangrenous.—In this instance some of the
corrosive sublimate must have been decomposed by the laudanum,
and an insoluble meconate of mercury formed. But the quantity
thus decomposed could have been but a small proportion of the
whole,—as was indeed proved by the extensive ravages actually
committed in the whole alimentary canal. I conceive, therefore,
that there is no other way of accounting for the slight apparent effects
of the corrosive sublimate, at the commencement particularly, than
by supposing that the narcotic operation of the opium veiled or actually
retarded the irritant action of the corrosive sublimate.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. <i>Poisoning with Opium and Belladonna.</i>—A lady, who used
a compound infusion of opium and belladonna as a wash for an eruption
in the vulva, took it into her head one day to use the wash as
an injection; and actually received three successive injections, containing
each the active matter of a scruple of opium and half an ounce
of belladonna leaves. Fortunately none of the three was retained
above a few minutes, except the last, which was not discharged for
ten minutes. In less than an hour, she was found in bed in a deep
sleep, but the true cause was not suspected till three hours later.
She was then completely insensible and motionless, with the face
pale, the pupils excessively dilated and not contractile, the pulse
frequent and small, and the breathing hurried. After the use of purgative
injections, blood-letting, leeches to the head, and sinapisms to
the legs, she began in five hours to show some sign of returning
consciousness, which improved after a fit of vomiting. When
thoroughly roused, her vision continued dim, the pupils excessively
dilated, and the ideas somewhat confused. For three days the pulse
continued frequent, and the pupils somewhat dilated.<a id='r2560' /><a href='#f2560' class='c013'><sup>[2560]</sup></a> Here the
opium seems to have prevented the delirium usually induced by
belladonna in the early stage, while on the other hand the belladonna
prevented the usual effect of opium on the pupils, and actually produced
the opposite action.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. In the following cases, the active poisons to which the individuals
were exposed were so numerous, that it is impossible to say
which or how many of them occasioned the symptoms. A colour-maker
was superintending a process in which cobalt, arsenic, mercury,
sal-ammoniac, and nitric acid were subjected to heat in a mattrass,
when the mattrass suddenly gave way, and a dense vapour
was instantly discharged. The manufacturer, before he could escape,
fell down insensible; and though speedily removed, he died in no
long time, affected with enormous swelling of the abdomen. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_743'>743</span>workman who was also present, escaped by a window; but was
nevertheless immediately attacked with swelling of the belly, which
speedily became very great, and was attended with pain in the jaws,
and dimness of sight. These symptoms were very slowly dissipated
under the use of cold bathing and purgatives, which brought away
an enormous quantity of fetid gas.<a id='r2561' /><a href='#f2561' class='c013'><sup>[2561]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>These are not the only examples of compound poisoning which
have come under my attention. But others I have noticed are not
detailed with sufficient exactness to make it worth while to quote
them. The instances given, however, are sufficient to show that
poisons of opposite qualities given about the same time in large doses
will disguise one another’s effects, or impede, or perhaps even prevent
them, in a manner which renders such a combination of circumstances
an important subject of inquiry for the medico-legal toxicologist.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is probable that the modifying influence is established in one of
two ways,—either by one poison producing a state of venous plethora
or distension, which impedes, or for a time prevents, the absorption
of the other,—or by one poison producing an insensibility
of the membrane with which the other is in contact; so that not only
the local injury actually done has not the usual remote effect on the
constitution, or on distant organs, but likewise is at times substantially
less extensive than in ordinary circumstances. These reflexions
arise naturally from a review of the preceding cases; but of course
further facts are necessary to give them weight.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'>1. Small funnel-shaped tube for testing minute portions of liquids.</p>

<p class='c020'>2. Apparatus for the distillation of fluids suspected to contain acids, one-seventh the
natural size.</p>

<p class='c020'>3. Tube for reducing very small portions of arsenic or mercury. The figure is of half
the natural size. The ball may be blown larger, if the material to be reduced is
bulky.</p>

<p class='c020'>4. A small glass funnel for introducing the material into the tube Fig. 1, without
soiling its inside.</p>

<p class='c020'>5. The ordinary apparatus for disengaging sulphuretted-hydrogen. The funnel must
be a little longer than the emerging tube. The fluid should not be at any time
much higher than in the figure, in order to secure the operator against its effervescing
up into the emerging tube. The figure is a fourth of the natural size.</p>

<p class='c020'>6. Instrument for washing down scanty precipitates on filters. It is a thin bottle capable
of standing heat—half-filled with water, which may be boiled on occasion,—and
having its cork pierced with a small tube drawn at its outer end to a very fine
bore. The breath is impelled into the bottle, and, the bottle being then reversed, a
very fine stream issues with great force.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='pageno' id='Page_756'>756</span>7. Tubes of natural size for collecting small portions of mercury by the process, p. <a href='#Page_300'>300</a>.</p>

<p class='c020'>8. Pipette, one-fourth the natural size, for removing by suction fluids lying over precipitates.
Some have a rectangular bend in the upper part, by means of which the
operator sees better the point of the instrument when in action; but such pipettes
are difficult to clean. That represented in the figure is easily cleaned with a
feather.</p>

<p class='c020'>9. Apparatus for reducing the sulphurets of some metals by a stream of hydrogen. A,
the vessel with zinc and diluted sulphuric acid, the latter of which may be renewed
by the funnel B. C, a ball on the emerging tube to prevent the liquid thrown up
by the effervescence from passing forward. D, E, corks by which C and G are
fitted into F, the tube which contains the sulphuret at F. G, the exit-tube for the
sulphuretted-hydrogen, plying into a vessel containing acetate of lead. When the
hydrogen has passed long enough to expel all the air, the spirit-lamp flame is applied
at F; and when sulphuretted-hydrogen is formed, the lead solution is blackened.
The figure is one-third the size of the apparatus.</p>

<p class='c006'><a href='#r60'>60</a>. It is not any part of the object of this work to enter into the history of toxicology,
more especially in early times. But it may be well here to state, that the claim
which has been made by some for Dr. Barry, of having discovered this mode of
treatment, is groundless. It is distinctly laid down by Nicander, Celsus, Dioscarides,
Galen, and others who lived in their times; and among the moderns who have mentioned
it, Gräter, in 1767, notices it in his thesis, “de venenis in genere,” printed at
Frankfort. On the ancient history of toxicology the reader will find an excellent
summary by Mr. Adams in the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, xxxiii. 315,
and a full exposition in Professor Marx’s elaborate work, “die Lehre von den Giften.”</p>

<p class='c006'><a href='#r106'>106</a>. As a specimen of the vague, desultory, and erroneous nature of the investigations
which have been made by authors on this subject, I may quote some remarks published
by Virey in the Journal Universel (vi. 26), and drawn, he says, from a comparison of
statements in various works. He states that arsenic, which is so fatal to animals in
general, merely purges dogs and wolves more or less; that nux vomica is less fatal
to man than to dogs; that pepper is fatal to hogs, parsley to parrots, the agrostis arundinacea
to goats, elder-berries to poultry, chenopodium vulvaria to swine; that on
the contrary the goat eats with impunity hemlock, daphne gnidium, and some species
of euphorbia; that the camel eats all species of euphorbia, the hedgehog cantharides,
the horse monkshood, ranunculus flammula, and buckthorn; asses and mules white
hellebore, swine yew-berries; all which are poisonous to animals in general. He does
not state special authorities for these facts; but they are taken from authors not of
the most modern times, and must be received, in my opinion, with great reserve, notwithstanding
the respect which he claims for the older writers. Some of the statements
are plainly false.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a more recent paper Virey lays it down as a general principle, that poisons from
the inorganic kingdom act more or less on the whole animated creation, but that
vegetable and animal poisons are such only in respect to particular animals; that
carnivorous animals are more sensible to the action of vegetable poisons, but less so
to that of animal poisons, than herbivorous or graminivorous animals; and that the
activity of poisons on different animals bears a ratio in the first place to their relative
sensibility, and secondly, to the digestive power of their stomach. I question
whether these views will be generally admitted by toxicologists, without much more
extensive and more careful inquiries than any hitherto made. [Journ. de Chim. Méd.
vii. 214.]</p>

<p class='c006'>Another singular illustration of the facility with which facts are admitted in proof
of the varying effects of poisons on different animals, is a statement by a German
naturalist, Dr. Lenz, to the effect that the hedgehog altogether resists the most powerful
poisons. He states that he has seen one receive ten or twelve wounds from a
viper on the ears, muzzle, and tongue, without sustaining any harm; and that ultimately
it kills and devours the snake. He quotes Palias for the fact that it has taken
100 cantharides flies without injury, and says a medical friend who wished to dissect a
hedgehog, gave it successively hydrocyanic acid, arsenic, opium, and corrosive sublimate,
without being able to kill it [L’Institut. ii. 84]. His countryman Reich, however,
contradicts these statements, observing that he has poisoned the hedgehog with
hydrocyanic acid, arsenic, and corrosive sublimate, but that doses considerably larger
are required for a dog or cat. Ninety grains of medicinal hydrocyanic acid, thirty of
arsenic, and twenty of corrosive sublimate, occasioned death. [Annalen der Pharmacie,
i. 358.] One of my colleagues having lately quoted Lenz’s assertion in his lectures,
some of his pupils brought me two hedgehogs to be subjected to experiment.
A drop of the pure acid put upon the tongue killed each within a minute.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following experiments by Professor Gohier of the veterinary school of Lyons
are worth mentioning; but in order to be satisfactory would require to be performed
in a more consecutive train. Muriate of soda in the dose of two or three pounds
causes in the horse great disorder and even death. Calomel has no effect. The juice
of rhus toxicodendron has no effect on the <i>solipedes</i> either internally or applied to the
skin. Ten drachms of opium cause in the horse tympanitis and stupor, not somnolency.
Thirty-six grains of opium had no effect on a dog. Cantharides does not injure
the horse in the dose of a drachm, or the dog in that of nine grains. When the
sheep swallows yew-leaves it is soon seized with locked-jaw and convulsive movements
of the lips and flanks: in the horse they cause dilated pupil, convulsive movements
of the eyes, and restlessness: the goat and dog eat them with impunity [Corvisart’s
Journal de Médecine, xix. 156]: man is severely affected by them. Hyoscyamus,
stramonium, hemlock, and other narcotic vegetables, though powerfully narcotic
to man, will not affect the domestic animals unless given in doses 100 times as great as
those given to man. [Ibid. 154.]</p>

<p class='c006'>The most important researches I have yet seen in this line of inquiry are those of
Professor Viborg of Copenhagen, read in the Royal Danish Society of Sciences in
1792. He instituted a connected series of experiments, expressly to determine how
far the effects of poisons on man correspond with those on the lower animals. The
results were, that mineral poisons appeared to act nearly in the same manner on all
orders of animals, antimonial and barytic salts alone excepted, the former of which
acted powerfully on man, the carnivorous animals, and swine, but scarcely at all on
ruminating and herbivorous animals, while the latter in doses of a drachm had no
effect on horses: That animal poisons resemble mineral poisons in their leading
effects on most animals: That the vegetable acrids also act pretty uniformly on
most animals: and that of the vegetable narcotics there are few which possess poisonous
properties in regard to certain animals only. Yew-leaves kill all ruminating
animals, and, notwithstanding Virey’s statement, swine, mules, and horses, also chickens;
and they produce violent symptoms in geese, ducks, cats and dogs, although
Gohier says dogs eat them with impunity. An ape ate a large quantity of the Æthusa
cynapium without injury. Dogs took from an ounce and a half to three ounces of
belladonna without dangerous symptoms. [Marx, die Lehre von den Giften,—from
Viborg’s Sammlung von Abhandlungen für Thierärzte, i. 277.]</p>

<p class='c006'>Professor Mayer of Bonn, in an inquiry into the effects of the Coriaria myrtifolia,
found that rabbits are not affected at all by a drachm of the extract of the juice
given internally, or applied to a wound; while half a drachm swallowed by a cat
kills it in a few hours, and three grains will have the same effect when introduced
into a wound. He likewise found that it is a deadly poison to the dog, the hawk, and
the frog. [Journal der Praktischen Heilkunde, lxviii. 4, 43.]</p>

<p class='c006'>Professor Giacomini of Padua says, that “in many experiments performed by him
on dogs and rabbits, he has constantly observed, that the former, as being carnivorous
by nature, sustain stimulating substances tolerably well; while rabbits, being herbivorous,
stand stimulants ill, but sedatives well.” “Hence many herbivorous animals
eat with impunity large quantities of vegetable poisons of the sedative kind
which prove fatal to carnivorous animals.” [Annali Univ. di Med. 1841, i. 372.]
This may be true as a general rule. But it is not universally applicable; for alcoholic
fluids kill dogs with great swiftness in no great dose.</p>

<p class='c006'>An extraordinary statement was lately brought before the French Institute, to the
effect that 120 sheep, affected with an epidemic pleurisy, got each about 500 grains
of arsenic without sustaining the slightest harm; and that it was also ascertained to
have no poisonous action upon sheep even in a state of health. A commission of
the Institute, however, which was appointed to test this assertion, found that healthy
sheep were killed by a dose of 155 grains, if they had fasted for some time before
[Annales d’Hyg. Publ. &amp;c. 1843, xxix. 468.] It is reasonable to suppose, that ruminating
animals, whose alimentary canal is scarcely ever empty should suffer less than
carnivorous animals from such poisons as arsenic.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lassaigne, in some experiments with arsenic, incidentally remarked, that 246 grains
of solid arsenic given daily for four days had no effect whatever on a horse; but that
this result seemed to depend on the difficulty which the stomach must experience
in appropriating it among the bulky materials of its food; for 154 grains in solution
killed the same animal in six hours [Journ. de Chim. Méd. 1841, 82].—Gianelli
of Lucca found that a horse was killed in eight hours by 185 grains of powder of
arsenic given in the form of bolus [Annales d’Hyg. Publ. &amp;c. 1842, xxviii. 88].</p>

<p class='c006'>I might easily extend these extracts. But the result would be merely a mass of
contradiction, from which no sound conclusion could be drawn, otherwise the subject
would have been discussed in the text.</p>

some fragments in an open phial for three years without observing any change in appearance
or weight. [Annales de Chimie et de Physique, xi. 240.] Buchner once
made a similar observation, and is inclined to think that oxidation does not occur, if the
metal is quite pure. [Repertorium für die Pharmacie, xxi. 29.]</p>

<p class='c006'><a href='#r515'>515</a>. The only probable source of such impregnation is pyritic sulphur, which is frequently
used abroad, and has of late been occasionally employed in this country, for
making sulphuric acid. As pyrites commonly contains arsenic, the acid becomes adulterated
with oxide of arsenic, and may communicate the same impregnation to various
other reagents which are prepared by means of sulphuric acid. The oxide may easily
be detected in that acid by a stream of hydrosulphuric acid gas, after moderate dilution
with water; for pure acid is rendered milky; but an arsenical acid yields a yellow
precipitate of sulphuret of arsenic.</p>

<p class='c006'><a href='#r636'>636</a>. These facts are important, because they will enable the medical jurist in some circumstances
to decide a question which may be started as to the possibility of arsenic
having been the cause of death when it is very rapid. I have dwelt on them more particularly
than may appear necessary, because some loose statements on the subject
were made in a controversy on the occasion of a trial of some note, that of Hannah
Russell and Daniel Leny, at Lewes Summer Assizes 1826, for the murder of the husband
of the former. Arsenic was decidedly detected in the stomach, and it was proved
that the deceased did not live above three hours after the only meal at which the prisoners
could have administered the poison. Now during the controversy which arose
after the execution of one of the prisoners, it was alleged by one of the parties, among
other reasons for believing arsenic not to have been the cause of death, that this poison
never proves fatal so soon as in three hours,—that Sir Astley Cooper and Mr. Stanley
of London had never known a case prove fatal in less than seven hours—and that Dr.
Male’s case mentioned above is the shortest on record. The instances quoted above
overthrow this whole line of statement. It was mentioned by Mr. Evans, the chief
crown witness, but I know not on what authority, that, on the trial of Samuel Smith
for poisoning, held at Warwick Summer Assizes 1826, the deceased was proved to have
expired in two hours after taking a quarter of an ounce of arsenic. I have examined
with some care the documents in the Lewes case, which were obligingly communicated
to me by Mr. Evans; and I have been quite unable to discover any reason for questioning
the reality of poisoning, or for the ferment which it seems the subsequent controversy
excited. The case seems to have been satisfactorily made out by Mr. Evans in
the first instance; and no sound medical jurist would for a moment suffer a shadow
of doubt to be thrown over his mind by the criticisms of Mr. Evans’s antagonist.</p>

<p class='c006'><a href='#r644'>644</a>. This statement might be excellently illustrated by the particulars of an English
trial in 1842, where the prisoner escaped, though arsenic was found in the stomach of
the deceased, because the judge, resting on the medical evidence, urged that arsenic
caused so much pain in the stomach as generally to make the person shriek with agony,
while in this case there was no uneasiness except pain in the head. As the case, however,
was by no means creditable to the parties concerned in it, I shall rest satisfied
with the present allusion.</p>

15,000th the lead, though slightly whitened, retained its weight exactly, weighing at

<p class='c006'><a href='#r1556'>1556</a>. I have taken the liberty of applying this term to an establishment unique perhaps
in the history of the world. The Voirie et Chantier d’Ecarrissage of Montfaucon,
which has existed close to the walls of Paris for several centuries, is an enclosure of
many acres, where the contents of the necessaries of the city are collected in enormous
pits, and where horses, dogs, and cats are flayed to the amount of forty or fifty thousand
annually. The fat is melted for blowpipe lamps; the bones are in a great measure
burnt on the premises for fuel; the intestines are made into coarse gut for machinery;
the flesh, blood, and garbage are heaped to putrefy for manure; and in summer
a bed of compost is spread to breed maggots for feeding poultry. There is no
drain. Description cannot convey an idea of the stench. The committee of the Board
of Health, appointed to make inquiries into the best mode of abating the nuisance, in
vain attempted to penetrate into the place. Yet the workmen and their families are
stout, healthy, and long lived.</p>

<p class='c006'><a href='#r1690'>1690</a>. Repertorium für die Pharmacie, xxxi. 174.—Professor Orfila, in the last edition
of his Toxicologie Gén. [1843, ii. 253], has attacked in no very measured terms this
opinion of Professor Buchner and myself. But, although he professes to give a literal
translation of the passage above, he has translated it so incorrectly as wholly to misrepresent
our opinion. The close of the paragraph, “chemical analysis must often fail
to detect opium where there could be no doubt of its <i>having been administered</i> in large
quantity,” is rendered into French by the Parisian Professor in these words,—“l’analyse
chimique, propre à constater l’existence de l’opium, est souvent inutile, même
dans le cas <i>ou il existe</i> une grande quantité de cette substance,”—which is a very different
proposition. Orfila clearly overrates the utility of the process for detecting opium,
both in this criticism and in his whole observations on the subject, by losing sight of
the tendency of absorption to remove the poison beyond reach.</p>

<p class='c006'><a href='#r1694'>1694</a>. Dr. Pereira states that he is obliged to differ from me upon this important subject
for he “has several times obtained from the stomach of subjects in the dissecting-room
a liquor which reddened the salts of iron” (Elements of Materia Medica,
p. 1741). This fact, however, does not exactly touch the question. The reddening
must be occasioned, not in the crude fluid, but with a substance obtained by the process
of analysis for detecting meconic acid in complex organic mixtures,—otherwise
the proposition in the text stands good.</p>

<p class='c006'><a href='#r1905'>1905</a>. Professor Amos of the London University, in criticizing in his Lectures what I
have said of this case in the first edition of the present work, has accused me of misstating
the evidence, and grounds the charge on a Report by a professional Reporter,
where no notice is taken of the phial having been wrapped up in paper, or of the bed-clothes
having been pulled up to the chin, or of the arms being crossed over the
trunk [Lond. Med. Gazette, viii. 577]. I have nevertheless thought it right to retain my
original statement of the evidence, as it was derived from what I still consider the
best authority,—the medical witness, who mentions the special fact on which he
founded the most important, indeed the only important professional opinion in the
case, and to which therefore his attention must have been more pointedly turned than
that of any Law-Reporter. The Report alluded to by Professor Amos was afterwards
published in the Medical Gazette, viii. 759.</p>

the following. Diebe und Huren um ihr Verbrechen desto ungehinderter zu
begehen, wenn sie die Leute damit eingeschläfert haben; Hurenwirthinnen, um in
ihren gemietheten Mägdchen alles Gefühl der natürlichen Schaam zu ersticken; alte
Hurer um junge Mägdchen zu verführen; Missethäter um ihre Wächter sinnlos zu
machen; Ehebrecherinnen, um ihre Männer zu ruhigen Zuschauern ihrer Schandthaten
zu machen. For most of these purposes gin and whisky are the instruments of villany
in Britain; and of late, as already mentioned, opium has been resorted to.</p>

<p class='c006'><a href='#r2241'>2241</a>. Instead of quoting special facts on the subject of poisoning with Œnanthe, I
have thought it better to give in the meantime a short analysis of a long investigation,
which I have from time to time made on the subject, and which was read in the Royal
Society of Edinburgh last year. This paper will be published ere long; and the references
and experiments will then be supplied, which, if introduced here, will lead to disproportionate
details.</p>

<p class='c006'><a href='#r2354'>2354</a>. I have not altered the statement as to this point in the former editions. Yet I
strongly suspect that authors, who describe the spasm which precedes death to continue
as it were into the rigidity which occurs after death, must have observed inaccurately.
For in the numerous experiments I have made and witnessed in animals, flaccidity
invariably took place at the time of death, and continued for a moderate interval.</p>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
